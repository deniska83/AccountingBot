ABOUT THIS REPORT

This report covers calendar year 2021 and provides qualitative and quantitative information on

our approach to managing our Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) opportunities and

risks. In some cases, we also share highlights from programs and initiatives that were launched

in 2022 to provide more up-to-date information to our stakeholders.

When we use the terms “American Express,” “company,” “we,” “us,” or “our” in this report, we

mean the American Express Company and its subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, unless we

state, or the context implies, otherwise.

Reporting guidelines and content

This report follows the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), Sustainability Accounting Standards

Board (SASB), and Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) reporting

guidelines with respect to our priority ESG issues. GRI, SASB, and TCFD indexes can be found

in the Supporting Data section of the report.

In this report, the use of the term “materiality” and other similar terms is intended to reect our

priority ESG issues. We are not using such terms as they are used under the securities or other

laws of the United States or any other jurisdiction or as these terms are used in the context of

nancial statements and nancial reporting.

We report on ESG issues that pertain to us through this ESG report and the American Express

Corporate Sustainability website. Additional information about our company can be found

through our Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DE&I) Report, submissions to the CDP (formerly

Carbon Disclosure Project), in our annual and quarterly reports and our proxy statement

on le with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and on the American Express

commitments and goals, contain words such as “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “plan,” “aim,” “will,” “may,” “should,”
“could,” “would,” “likely,” “potential,” “commit,” “continue,” or other similar expressions. Actual results may differ from those
set forth in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors, including: competition, brand perceptions and
reputation; an inability to develop and market value propositions that appeal to Card Members and new customers; the
amount and ecacy of investments in product innovations, resources, marketing campaigns and programs; changing
customer behaviors, interest in the company’s products, resources and programs, and willingness to access capital
provided by the company, spend money at small businesses, and value environmentally and socially responsible products
and services; management’s inability to identify suitable suppliers, grantees, partners and community investments and
negotiate acceptable terms; the actual amount the company spends with suppliers, on ESG initiatives and to make
appropriate salary adjustments, all while implementing operating expense control initiatives; an inability to build
partnerships and execute programs with other companies and of partners to meet their obligations to the company;
changes in developing standards and certications; the cost and availability of renewable energy, carbon removal and
carbon offset projects, energy attribute certicates, certied paper, and green buildings, and alternatives to single-use
plastic; supply chain and market disruption; regulation; potential M&A activity; severe weather conditions, natural
disasters and other catastrophic events; changes in the company’s real estate, technology, colleague and community
engagement, and risk management strategies; an inability of waste management systems to divert waste to recycling and
composting facilities; and changes in economic or business conditions and the company’s ability to grow, improve its
nancial performance and execute on its strategies. A further description of these and other risks and uncertainties can
be found in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 (the “2021 Annual Report”),

A MESSAGE FROM OUR CHAIRMAN AND CEO

“ Our strength comes from

the impact we can make on

people’s lives—or what we

call “the powerful backing

of American Express”—

and our ESG strategy is a

natural extension of this.”

 STEPHEN J. SQUERI
CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
American Express is built on trust, integrity, and service

excellence. Living up to this legacy means doing what is

right for our colleagues, customers, and communities. Our

strength comes from the impact we can make on people’s

lives—or what we call “the powerful backing of American

Express”—and our ESG strategy is a natural extension of this.

The myriad of challenges facing the world today, many

unprecedented in our lifetime, underscore the importance

of our powerful backing promise. We are now over two years

into navigating the pandemic; the effects of climate change

are more apparent than ever; macroeconomic and geopolitical

instability is on the rise; and, just in the last few months, we

have witnessed the war in Ukraine unfold into a devastating

humanitarian crisis.

Against this backdrop, we continue to back our colleagues,

customers, and communities to drive positive impact.

As the way we live and work has evolved with the pandemic,

we have been focused on creating a new work model that

supports our colleagues. In March 2022, we ocially launched

Amex Flex, our new way of working that provides colleagues

with the exibility to work full time in the oce, fully virtually,

or a hybrid of both.

Amex Flex is designed to recapture the creativity and

collaboration of working together in person, while also

retaining the agility and productivity we were able to achieve

in a virtual environment during the pandemic. This approach

also enables us to broaden the talent pool we can attract

and strengthen retention as we provide colleagues with a

compelling value proposition that offers choice, leading

benets, competitive compensation, and opportunities for

growth and career advancement.

Our colleagues are critical to our success, and they are the

driving force behind the impact we make in people’s lives

and in the communities we serve. I am exceptionally proud of

what we achieved to date on our ESG strategy, thanks to the

dedication of our colleagues around the world who bring our

company’s purpose to life.

Advancing Our ESG Priorities

We announced our ESG framework in 2020, centered around

three core priorities: Promote Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion

(DE&I); Advance Climate Solutions; and Build Financial

Condence. Since then, we have solidied our strategy

by developing a clear roadmap to translate our objectives

into action.

Promote Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DE&I)

We are continuing to strengthen our culture of inclusion and

belonging across the company and providing transparency

into our efforts. In 2021, we published our inaugural DE&I

Report, which included detailed disclosures on diversity

representation among colleagues and our ongoing efforts to

maintain a diverse and equitable workplace through inclusive

hiring, career growth, retention, and equal pay practices.

In addition to sharing our progress across these areas in 2021,

in this report we have included additional details related to

representation of our ethnically and racially diverse colleagues

in the US.

We also exceeded $1 billion in spending toward our DE&I Action

Plan announced in October 2020. The plan supported our

efforts to increase spending with underrepresented-owned

suppliers, expanding access to capital and nancial education

and partnering with nonprot organizations focused on

promoting equality, among other initiatives.

To build on this momentum, I am pleased to announce an

additional $3 billion—which means we now aim to spend

$4 billion in total from late 2020 through 2025—toward our

DE&I Action Plan and initiatives globally. The majority of

additional spending will continue to be allocated with suppliers.

Advance Climate Solutions

We are focused on advancing solutions that address the

climate crisis by minimizing our carbon footprint and helping

our customers and communities do the same.

Last year marked an important step forward for us, as we

committed to net-zero emissions by 2035, in alignment with

the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi), building on our

CarbonNeutral® operations powered by 100% renewable

electricity since 2018.

To reduce our environmental impact across our global real

estate portfolio, we have spent more than $150 million since

2019 on the development of facilities that have received green

building certication. In addition to these investments, we

have a goal to provide at least $10 million toward philanthropic

efforts for climate action as part of our new community giving

category: Backing Low-Carbon Communities. We have already

pledged over $3 million in grants to support climate and

nature-based solutions.

Last November, at the UN Climate Change Conference of

the Parties (COP26), we joined the World Economic Forum’s

Clean Skies for Tomorrow Coalition and Global Future

Council on Sustainable Tourism to help promote sustainable

travel practices. In addition, during Earth Month 2022, we

announced several new low-carbon solutions in line with our

2022 goal. These included new digital tools to help corporate

clients better understand and manage their carbon footprint,

such as a Carbon Footprint Dashboard and a Carbon Offset

Referral Suite. We also announced a goal of having the vast

majority of plastic cards issued by American Express made

of at least 70% recycled or reclaimed plastic by the end of

We have already begun expanding our offerings to
integrate recycled plastic into our cards worldwide, starting

with Canada and France.

Build Financial Condence

Rooted in our company’s purpose is helping people achieve

their aspirations, not only through our differentiated

products and services, but also through our investments

to strengthen the nancial well-being, security, and resilience

of our communities.

As a longstanding champion of small businesses, we continue

to support business owners globally as they navigate new

challenges from ination, supply chain disruptions, and labor

shortages, in addition to the ongoing impacts from the

pandemic. Our Shop Small campaign is foundational to these

efforts. Since 2020, we spent more than $300 million toward

campaign initiatives to help jumpstart spending at small

businesses. In November 2021, we held our 12th annual Small

Business Saturday event, which reached an all-time high

of $23.3 billion in estimated consumer spending at small

businesses in the US.^1 Consumers reported spending an

estimated £598 million at small businesses in the UK on

Small Business Saturday held on December 4, 2021,^2 and both

campaigns contributed toward our goal to drive $100 billion

in consumer spending at small businesses through 2025.

We also launched a new community giving category for building

nancial condence, “Backing Small,” which supports small

businesses by bringing together all our grant programs focused

on supporting small business. We have already pledged

$17 million to support Backing Small programs, including

Inclusive Backing, in partnership with Main Street America,

focused on underrepresented and economically vulnerable

business-owners, and the second year of our Backing Historic

Small Restaurants program across the US in 2022.

Our new Backing International Small Restaurants program

with the International Downtown Association is expanding

our support beyond the US by helping culturally signicant,

independent restaurants operated by underserved populations

and those in economic need in ve major cities: London,

Mexico City, Sydney, Tokyo, and Toronto.

We also deepened our focus on nancial literacy, training,

and mentoring programs for individuals and business owners

through our community giving. Building on our longstanding

partnership with Junior Achievement, we plan to offer bespoke

nancial literacy education and programs to more than 5,

students in 11 countries, focusing on underrepresented and

underserved communities, through JA Worldwide.

The American Express 2021 Small Business Saturday Consumer Insights Survey was conducted by Teneo
on behalf of American Express and the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB). The study is
a nationally representative sample of 2,426 U.S. adults 18 years of age or older. The sample was collected
using an email invitation and an online survey. The study gathered self-reported data and does not reect
actual receipts or sales. It was conducted anonymously on November 28, 2021. The survey has an overall
margin of error of +/- 2.0%, at the 95% level of condence. Projections are based on the current U.S.
Census estimates of the U.S. adult population, age 18 years and over.
Estimated spend based on data collected from 4000 UK adults polled by Opinium between 5pm on
Saturday 4 December 2021 and 10pm on Sunday 5 December 2021. The £598 million gure for national
spending calculated using ONS estimation of the UK adult population based on self-reported shopper
estimates of spend and does not reect actual receipts or sales.

In May 2022, we issued our inaugural $1 billion ESG Bond, which we will use to nance new and existing Green and Social projects.

This is our rst-ever nancing instrument dedicated to support our ESG strategy and will serve to advance our programs and

promote ESG-related investments.

Enhancing Our ESG Governance

In addition to progressing on our ESG goals, we have been focused on the governance and disclosures around our ESG strategy

and programs. In 2022, we incorporated ESG risks, including climate-related risks, as an emerging risk for the Company within our

Enterprise Risk Management framework.

To help manage our climate-related risks, in 2021, we became a formal supporter of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial

Disclosures (TCFD) and assessed physical and transition risks to our business in alignment with the TCFD recommendations.

Conclusion

Over the last two years we have created more opportunities to collaborate and innovate across the enterprise and we have done a

signicant amount of work to dene our ESG priorities and objectives. We also established measurable goals and action plans to

achieve them as we continue to execute across each of our three ESG pillars. All of this work has accelerated our progress and put

us on a clear path to strengthen our global impact in the coming years.

Our work has only just begun. As we look ahead, we will continue to build on our momentum, putting our ESG strategy into action

to back our colleagues, customers, and communities and make a positive impact in people’s lives and the world we live in.

PRIORITIES TO OUR ESG STRATEGY

In 2022, we announced new grant priorities that build on our legacy

of community giving and directly support our ESG strategy roadmap

launched in 2021. Going forward, the American Express Foundation

will direct its resources to three core priorities:

Backing Small

Support for underrepresented and economically
vulnerable small business owners and
entrepreneurs through our “Backing Small”
initiative, including grants, mentoring support,
and technical assistance through established
community partnerships. Programs include:
Inclusive Backing
Coalition to Back Black Businesses
Backing Historic Small Restaurants
Backing International Small Restaurants
Blueprint: Backing BIPOC Businesses in Canada
First Nations Business Growth Program in Australia
Financial literacy education, training,
and mentoring for underrepresented
individuals and families to build nancial
awareness, scal acumen, and success,
including for school age grades 5-12,
during higher education, or when individuals
are entering or re-entering the workforce.
Backing Low-Carbon Communities

Advance climate innovation and solutions, particularly in
urban areas, through:
Programs, partnerships, and action focused on energy
transition, emissions reduction, and eciency.
Community-led climate projects focused on nature-based
or clean energy initiatives, including those led by
underrepresented groups.
Disaster relief and resilience building programs and
initiatives in extreme weather prone areas and cities where
our colleagues and customers live and work to provide

success and the future of work, including the
green economy, digital futures, and STEAM
elds such as science, technology, engineering,
the arts, and mathematics:
Programs may include school-based, college,
trade school, public service, or workforce-
related training or mentoring to support
skill building, education, the transition to
meaningful employment, or self-suciency
for underrepresented populations.
Advocacy to support education and
workforce development in underrepresented
communities:
Eligible organizations for underrepresented
communities include those supporting

OUR INAUGURAL $1 BILLION ESG BOND

In May 2022, American Express completed its rst-ever ESG bond offering, maturing in 2029.

We intend that an amount equivalent to the net proceeds of the $1 billion ESG bond will be

allocated toward new and/or existing eligible projects in the Green and Social categories, as

directed by the newly developed American Express Sustainable Financing Framework, which

is aligned with the company’s global ESG strategy.

Projects in the Green category include those related to green

buildings, energy eciency improvements and renewable

energy, and the circular economy, such as expenditures

related to updating American Express Cards to reclaimed or

recycled plastics.

Projects in the Social category include socioeconomic

advancement and empowerment initiatives, such as

expenditures and programs designed to drive economic

growth among diverse groups through the procurement of

products and services from diverse suppliers and vendors

at least 51% owned by members of diverse populations,

independently certied through a qualied agency.

Other projects in the Social category include merchant

support programs like our Shop Small campaign, nancial

empowerment programs, including support of the ByBlack

platform to verify businesses as majority-owned by Black

SUPPORTING HUMANITARIAN RELIEF EFFORTS IN UKRAINE

In light of the attacks on the Ukrainian people, we have taken

several actions to support our colleagues, customers, and the

humanitarian relief efforts in the region.

For example, we teamed up with Hilton to donate up to one

million hotel room nights in hotels across Europe to support

Ukrainian refugees and rst responders who are helping them.

We also enabled our US Consumer, Small Business, and

Corporate Card Members who are enrolled in the Membership

Rewards® program to use their Membership Rewards to

support select charities that are providing humanitarian relief

efforts in Ukraine and affected parts of Europe and matched

the dollar value of their contributions made using points with

PayPal Giving Fund through June 15, 2022. We are continuing

to match colleague donations through the American Express

Match program.

We also provided $1 million in aid to the following

organizations that are providing assistance to impacted

populations:

- $250,000 to the International Rescue Committee (IRC)

to provide necessary resources where they are needed most,

including to those who have ed their homes.

- $250,000 to the International Medical Corps (IMC),

which has deployed mobile medical teams to provide

essential emergency and primary health services, mental

health and psychosocial support services, and COVID-

awareness and prevention services to help keep affected

populations safe from the pandemic.

- $250,000 to the American Red Cross to support

coordinated relief efforts by the International Federation of

Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and other Red Cross

partners who are responding to urgent needs and providing

technical assistance on the ground.

- $250,000 toward UNICEF’s emergency appeal to support

children and families as the crisis escalates with life-saving

programs, safe water, emergency health, hygiene, education

aid, and other immediate help for those in need of support.

PROVIDING POWERFUL BACKING THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC

We have provided support to our colleagues, customers, and

communities over the last two years of the COVID-19 pandemic.

For colleagues, this included:

Providing coverage of out-of-pocket medical and pharmacy
costs related to COVID-19 testing and treatment for

colleagues enrolled in our US medical plans.

Up to 16 hours of paid time off for obtaining COVID-
vaccines and boosters.

Partnering with departments of health and hospitals in the
US and India to host onsite vaccine clinics for our colleagues,

families, and contractors.

For customers:

We continued to help merchant partners do business while
keeping their own customers and staff safe.

For businesses, we raised contactless transaction thresholds
to reduce physical contact at points of sale and reminded

merchants that we do not require them to collect Card

Members’ signatures.

In the communities we serve:

We provided more than $11 million in philanthropic support
for COVID-19 relief efforts since the start of the pandemic

through 2021, delivering nancial support to nonprots

worldwide working on the front lines of the ongoing global

crisis. One of these partners was (RED), which we’ve

highlighted below.

In 2021, we joined forces with (RED) to support equitable

access to testing, treatment, and vaccines in response to

the impact of COVID-19 in the world’s poorest countries.

To shine a spotlight on the campaign, we partnered with

(RED) to launch CODE (RED) alongside the reopening of

Broadway, with Lin-Manuel Miranda joining American Express

at a special performance of the hit musical “Hamilton.”

CODE RED: A POWERFUL PARTNERSHIP FOR PUBLIC HEALTH

We provided Card Members with the option to use

Membership Rewards points to make donations through

PayPal’s Pay with Rewards feature to help provide COVID-

testing, treatment, and vaccines for people most in need.

We also donated $250,000 to COVID-19 relief efforts

championed by (RED) and its partners, Fund for the Global

Fund, and COVAX, and matched employee contributions to

the campaign.

Community support during
the COVID-19 pandemic

AMEX FLEX: OUR NEW WAY OF WORKING

AMEX FLEX HAS THREE

WORK DESIGNATIONS

Our colleagues remained productive during the pandemic, which

required us to become even more agile in how we work, and our

new Amex Flex model is designed to continue this trend while

leveling the playing eld for colleagues across jobs and locations.

In-person connections at the oce will also continue to play

an important role in American Express’ future. We believe that

being together in person has benets, including spontaneous

connections and idea sharing, team bonding and camaraderie,

workspaces designed for creativity and collaboration, and more

opportunities for mentorship, in-person coaching, and networking.

In March 2022, we ocially launched Amex Flex, our new way of working where colleagues can

work in the oce, at home, or can take a hybrid approach that combines both. Amex Flex is

designed to leverage the best of both in-person and remote work and to enable colleagues to

have greater exibility in their personal and professional lives.

To back our colleagues during this transition, we are:

Phasing-in Amex Flex and avoiding a “one-size-ts-all"
approach

Surveying our colleagues to garner feedback
Remaining exible to meet the needs of our colleagues
Deploying our real estate, technology, and medical teams
to help create a welcoming and safe oce environment

Conducting informational and re-orientation sessions on
topics such as the ongoing health resources we are offering

Introducing new oce technologies to enhance the
workplace experience and make it easy to collaborate with

colleagues, such as equipping conference and huddle rooms

with high-denition videoconferencing technology

Adding new technology benets that provide colleagues
the opportunity to order company-issued hardware and

software to support working from home, regardless of their

work designation

As of June 1, 2022
Offering exibility has always been a part

of our culture. In fact, before the pandemic

around 20% of our US workforce was virtual.

Since we announced Amex Flex, the majority

of our colleagues in the US have chosen hybrid

schedules, opting to spend their time between

in-oce and virtual days, coming into the

oce about two days per week, while more

than 40% have opted to be fully virtual, a

percentage that has doubled over the last

two years.

As part of Amex Flex, all colleagues, except

for those who are required to work onsite, will

have the opportunity to work up to 30 days per

calendar year from a location other than their

primary work location.

Our rst oce sites to adopt Amex Flex were in

the UK and the US in the rst quarter of 2022.

Since then, oces in 18 countries in total have

started Amex Flex.

Strategy Into Action: Exceeding $1 Billion of Spend Toward Our DE&I Action Plan,

Announcing an Additional $3 Billion

When we announced our $1 billion Diversity, Equity, and

Inclusion (DE&I) Action Plan in October of 2020, we sought

to build on our foundation of supporting diverse representation

and equal opportunities for our colleagues, customers,

and communities. That legacy includes a longstanding

commitment to fostering an inclusive and welcoming

workplace that reects the diversity of our communities,

promoting equal economic opportunity for our diverse

customer base and business partners, and supporting

community initiatives focused on advancing equality and

social justice.

As of March 2022, we exceeded $1 billion in spending

since October 2020 toward our DE&I Action Plan, ahead

of schedule. Our investments included spending with

underrepresented-owned suppliers, expanding access to

capital and nancial education for underrepresented-owned

small businesses, supporting partnerships with nonprot

organizations focused on promoting equality and social justice,

and investments in pay equity.

$4B toward DE&I

Building on our progress, we now plan to spend an additional $3 billion

toward DE&I initiatives—for an ambition to spend $4 billion in total from

late 2020 through the end of 2025.

The majority of additional spend will continue to be allocated to

underrepresented-owned suppliers.

Global investments outside the United States may include initiatives

like Blueprint: Backing BIPOC Businesses,™ a mentorship and grant

program designed to support the advancement of Black, Indigenous,

or People of Color (BIPOC) business owners in Canada. Launched last

year, 100 Blueprint recipients own and operate small businesses in cities

across Canada and represent a wide range of industries, including

agriculture, consulting services, and technology solutions.

We seek to foster an inclusive environment

where colleagues can grow and develop in

enterprise leadership and agile decision-making in the way

we work. In the spring of 2022, we launched Amex Flex, a

Maintaining 100% pay equity

We regularly review our compensation practices to ensure colleagues in the same job, level

and location are compensated fairly regardless of gender globally, and race and ethnicity in

the United States.

In 2021, for the second consecutive year, we achieved 100% pay “equity”—meaning no

statistical differences in pay—across genders globally and across races and ethnicities in

the US. Our pay equity achievement is supported by compensation policies, processes, and

practices designed to pay colleagues in all roles and at all levels based on performance and

other business-related criteria, making appropriate salary adjustments where needed.

As part of the evaluation of our pay practices and reward structure, we have conducted annual

pay equity reviews with independent experts since 2017. Since 2019, this analysis has covered

our entire global colleague population across genders globally and across races and ethnicities

in the US, assessing pay on a statistical basis and considering key factors that inuence

compensation, including but not limited to tenure, role, level, geography, and performance.

In 2021, we began disclosing the “raw median pay gap” for women globally and for diverse

colleagues in the United States. This metric compares differences in raw median base pay, with

no adjustments for factors such as role, level, tenure, performance, or geography. In 2021, the

median pay for women globally at American Express was 106.7% of the median pay for men. The

median pay for racially/ethnically diverse colleagues in the US was 95.2% of that for white colleagues.^7

We believe our pay equity review provides a more accurate and comprehensive picture of our

compensation practices overall because it provides a more granular view that considers many

important factors known to affect an individual’s compensation. For this reason, we use pay

equity as the standard we hold ourselves accountable to. We remain committed to maintaining

100% pay equity for colleagues across genders globally and across races and ethnicities in the

US by continuing our annual pay equity review process.

Belonging and inclusion at American Express

To support our efforts to create an inclusive and welcoming culture for our colleagues, we

introduced two trainings in 2020: a “Strengthening Our Culture of Belonging and Inclusion”

course and a “Belonging at Amex” workshop. We supplemented these trainings with conversations

and informational sessions on how colleagues can contribute to a culture of inclusion.

Throughout, colleagues had access to numerous resources on leading inclusively, having

meaningful conversations, and making their voices heard.

To further help colleagues feel a sense of belonging, we have 14 Colleague Networks, with

over 100 chapters worldwide, for sharing common experiences and interests:

Asian Network at American Express (ANA)
Black Engagement Network (BEN)
Christian Network (SALT)

In addition to our Colleague Networks, we have nine Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Councils

EXPANSIVE AND IMPACTFUL FAMILY SUPPORT

For US colleagues who use adoption, surrogacy, or egg/sperm donors, we offer
reimbursement that covers expenses up to $35,000—for up to two events, with a lifetime
maximum of $70,000. Those who undergo reproductive treatments are eligible for up to
$35,000 in medical assistance.
“ We adopted our son and in fact, Amex has been there for us since day one and
throughout every step of the way,” says Sean B., an analyst in our Global Risk
and Compliance department. “The company’s family planning and assistance
program provided us with the nancial support to adopt earlier than what
we thought was possible. Additionally, the family concierge benet helped
us throughout the adoption process and is a resource we continue to use when
we need childcare.”
“ The dependent care exible spending account has also provided comfort
nancially,” Sean added, “which has especially been helpful during these current
times when we’re doing the best we can in a lot of situations that are entirely new
and the challenges we’ve had to navigate around due to COVID.”
This support continues after colleagues welcome their new family members. Under our
gender-neutral parental leave policy, eligible colleagues in the United States can take up
to 20 weeks parental leave with full base pay, whether they’re welcoming a child through
pregnancy, adoption, or surrogacy. We also provide six to eight weeks of additional leave
if medically necessary.
We also provide colleagues in Canada, the UK, and the US access to in-home or center-
based childcare when their regular arrangements fall through, as well as connection with
24/7 consultants who can help arrange in-home care for an adult loved one recovering
from an illness or injury.

Backing women colleagues

In 2021, women represented more than half of our workforce

worldwide, and approximately four out of 10 senior executives

were women. We are invested in engaging, retaining, and

backing our women colleagues and helping them realize their

professional potential through initiatives and programs that

help them grow, develop, and thrive. For example, in India,

we have established more than 20 small peer group “Lean

In Circles” designed to build connection and new skills.

Through customized training and partnerships with external

organizations, we offer colleagues a variety of meaningful

learning and development opportunities.

In 2020, we launched the Ambition Project in partnership with

The New York Women’s Foundation to encourage our women

colleagues to fully embrace their ambition and support the

ambitions of others. In 2022, we once again partnered with the

New York Women’s Foundation for a global study on women’s

relationship with ambition, both in their careers and personal

lives—and their condence in achieving success after a global

pandemic. Amidst a rapidly changing workforce, women remain

ambitious, and we continue to proudly back their aspirations.

Backing colleagues with disabilities

We are committed to providing colleagues with an inclusive

work environment, from accessibility tools on the job to

benets that support a healthy work-life balance.

In 2021, we enabled closed captioning as a standard for virtual

livestream events to make broadcast content more accessible.

We also launched enhanced accessibility features for online

meetings, such as closed captioning, screen reader notications,

and the ability to change chat font size. These represent just a

few of the resources and best practices we’ve made available

to colleagues across the enterprise.

To advance our disability inclusion initiatives, we’re now

members of the Inclusion Works community as part of our

Disability:IN partnership, in which we collaborate with

disability inclusion experts to implement best practices in this

space. We’ve continued our membership in the Valuable 500

in the UK, which enlists companies to keep disability inclusion

on the leadership agenda and make a commitment to action.

Within our company, our Disability Awareness Network (DAN)

plays an important role in creating a sense of belonging and

community among our colleagues with seen and unseen

disabilities and raising awareness for disability inclusion. For

International Day of Persons with Disabilities in December 2021,

DAN brought together authors, advocates, entrepreneurs,

mental health experts, and our colleagues from India, Spain,

the UK, and beyond under the common theme of “Recognize

More: Proudly Backing Disability Inclusion.” This virtual event

was an opportunity to drive inclusion of people with disabilities

by demonstrating support and helping educate allies on how

best to partner with their colleagues with disabilities.

In 2022, nearly 4,000 colleagues around the

world joined our enterprise-wide International

Women’s Day events live, featuring

American Express leaders and external

guests, in addition to 30 local events. For

example, our Japan Women’s Network

organized an event with a guest speaker on

the topic of how to “Design Your Ambition.”

Backing Black and African American colleagues

A culture of belonging gains strength when colleagues

worldwide have opportunities to make their voices heard,

listen, learn, and build their skills for inclusive leadership.

Heritage months and cultural moments provided valuable

occasions to spark these conversations and connections.

For instance, Black Engagement Network (BEN) chapters

across Canada and the United States celebrated Black

History Month with a variety of events, open to all colleagues,

under the theme of “Say It Loud.” BEN, in partnership with

its executive committee sponsors, also promoted networking

and development for vice presidents and above. Executive

BEN held its sixth Global Forum in June 2021. The forum

brought together 72 Black leaders from across the company,

our CEO and Executive Committee members, and host

Anré Williams, CEO, American Express National Bank and

Group President of Enterprise Services. Attendees gained

exposure to new perspectives, networked, honed their

leadership skills, and helped shape plans for driving change

for our Black colleagues.

In 2022, we made Juneteenth, also known as Black

Independence Day, a company holiday in the US, giving

colleagues the day to learn, celebrate, and reect. Juneteenth

is a reminder of both the progress that has been made and

the work still left to be done to ensure all people have equal

opportunities to achieve dignity, happiness, and success.

Backing Hispanic and Latinx colleagues

During Hispanic and Latinx Heritage Month, our Hispanic Origin

and Latin American Colleague Network (HOLA), hosted global

events focused on “Amplifying the Impact: Proudly Backing

Hispanic and Latinx Achievement.”

Our theme showcased our commitment to celebrating our

Hispanic and Latinx colleagues—appreciating who they are,

acknowledging the strength they bring to our organization,

and amplifying the lasting impact of their accomplishments.

Backing Asian, Asian American, and Pacic

Islander colleagues

During Asian Pacic American Heritage Month in 2022,

we celebrated the rich cultural diversity of our colleagues

with the theme “Make Culture Shine: Proudly Backing All

Asian Communities.” We also hosted a conversation titled

“American Express Voices” with some of our Asian Network

Amex leaders about bringing their whole selves to work and

telling their stories.

Names are often tied to heritage and culture, and we took the

opportunity during Asian Pacic American Heritage Month in

2021 to introduce a new pronunciation feature in our company

Slack channel where colleagues can list the phonetic spelling

of their names. We also published an internal colleague feature

titled “What’s in a Name?” and encouraged colleagues to ask

and learn about each other’s names so we can all get to know

each other on a deeper level.

Backing LGBTQ+ inclusion

In 2021, our PRIDE+ Colleague Network developed a powerful

theme in honor of Pride Month to continue driving a message

of inclusion to our colleagues around the globe “Live Beyond

Labels: Proudly Backing All of You” and engaged colleagues in

enterprise-wide conversations.

In October 2021, we announced that we commenced an

exclusive three-year principal partnership with the Sydney Gay

and Lesbian Mardi Gras and that we will partner with Sydney

WorldPride in 2023.

As principal partner, we will work alongside the Sydney Gay

and Lesbian Mardi Gras and Sydney WorldPride teams to

coordinate a festival of events across Greater Sydney that

celebrate our diverse LGBTQ+ communities, which include the

iconic Mardi Gras Fair Day. These partnerships build upon our

support of LGBTQ+ communities, including our membership

with Open for Business—a coalition of companies making

the economic and business case for LGBTQ+ inclusion in

companies around the world. We also received Silver status

in the 2022 Australian Workplace Equality Index (AWEI).

Backing our service members and veterans

The Amex Veterans Network (VET) was launched in 201 2

and supports our colleagues who are currently serving in the

military, are veterans, have friends or family in the military, or

just want to show their support for our troops.

In 2021, American Express, in partnership with VET, provided a

$50,000 grant to American Corporate Partners (ACP), a national

nonprot organization focused on helping returning veterans

and active-duty spouses nd their next careers through one-

on-one mentoring, networking, and online career advice.

Raising the bar for supply chain diversity

Successful strategies and innovative products and services

require diverse perspectives and contributions. For these

reasons, American Express has a goal to increase spending with

underrepresented-owned suppliers who provide us with

professional services, marketing, and beyond.

To build a more diverse, inclusive supply chain, we consider at

least one diverse vendor for each request for proposal. We track

and measure our annual spend with certied business enterprises

run by underrepresented owners and operators, including:

Minority-owned Business Enterprises (MBE)
Black-owned Businesses
Women-owned Business Enterprises (WBE)
LGBT-owned Business Enterprises (LGBTE)
Veteran’s Business Enterprises (VBE)
Service-Disabled Veteran’s Business Enterprises (SDVBE)
Disability-owned Business Enterprises (DOBE)
Small Business Enterprises/8(a)/HUBZone rms
BACKING OUR CUSTOMERS AND PARTNERS

American Express seeks to meet the needs of under represented businesses and consumers

and develop more inclusive marketing initiatives. We are also focused on our efforts to help

underrepresented-owned businesses through our supplier diversity program.

In 2021, we introduced more than 65 new underrepresented-

owned suppliers to grow our program and in 2022 started

working with select suppliers to begin tracking diverse

supplier spend within their own supply chains.

Our supplier diversity partners include:

Disability: IN
Financial Services Roundtable for Supplier Diversity (FSRSD)
Minority Supplier Development UK (MSDUK)
National LGBT Chamber of Commerce (NGLCC)
National Minority Supplier Development Council (NMSDC)
National Veterans Business Development Council (NVBDC)
Supply Nation
US Black Chambers
WEConnect International
Women’s Business Enterprise National Council (WBENC)
In October 2020, we announced a goal to double our

annual spend with underrepresented-owned suppliers

in the United States from a 2019 baseline to $750 million

by the end of 2024, including increasing spend with

Black-owned suppliers to at least $100 million annually.

In 2021, we not only made progress toward this goal, but

also exceeded our initial expectations for the year, as

shown in the graphic below.

community investment

In 2021, we provided $20 million to Accion Opportunity Fund,

a nonprot Community Development Financial Institution

and small business lender, to expand access to loans for

historically underfunded small businesses in the United

States, including those owned by underrepresented groups.

Joining forces for more inclusive travel

In March 2022, we proudly announced our global platinum-

level sponsorship of the International LGBTQ+ Travel

Association (IGLTA), a global leader in advancing LGBTQ+

travel and have signed a multi-year agreement to join IGLTA.

IGLTA provides information and resources for LGBTQ+

travelers and expands LGBTQ+ tourism globally by

demonstrating its signicant social and economic impact.

This partnership supports diversity, equity, and inclusion in

the travel industry by enriching our Card Members’ journeys

through inclusive travel choices and practices.

Backing our customers with purpose-driven

travel options

Our customers are traveling with more purpose and seeking

to have a positive impact on the places they visit. According

to our Global Travel Trends report, 81% of respondents

reported that they want to travel to destinations where

they can immerse themselves in the local culture and 81%

of respondents want the money they spend while traveling

to go back to the local community.^8

To help our customers navigate purpose-driven travel options

and experience destinations in a more meaningful way,

American Express Travel is partnering with Kensington Tours

to launch bespoke itineraries in countries around the world

geared toward cultural exchange and supporting the local

economies. Our initial launch features customizable tours for

Denmark, Kenya, Peru, South Africa, and Vietnam available

for US Platinum Card Members to book exclusively through

American Express Travel.

By leveraging existing partnerships and cultivating new ones,

American Express Travel is identifying new thoughtful travel

options that align with what our customers value.

Methodology: Amex Trendex online poll was conducted by Morning Consult between February 3–11, 2022, among a national sample of 2,000 travelers in the US and 1,000 travelers in Japan, Australia, Mexico, India, UK, and
Canada who have a household income of at least $70K and dened as adults who typically travel by air at least once a year. Results from each country survey have a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

Connecting underrepresented-owned

businesses to capital and support

As part of our ESG strategy to Promote Diversity, Equity,

and Inclusion, we have a goal to provide at least 250,000

underrepresented-owned small- and medium-sized US

businesses access to capital and nancial education from late

2020 through 2024. We’re progressing toward this goal by

delivering educational resources, expanded access to credit

and loans, grants, marketing support, and more.

For nine years, we’ve partnered with Women Impacting

Public Policy and the US Small Business Administration to

help boost the prospects of women entrepreneurs to gain

government contracts. Our ChallengeHER program offers free

training webinars, workshops, mentoring, and direct access

to government buyers and local partner resources. From

2013 through the end of 2021, this initiative has hosted 170

webinars and facilitated over 4,800 meetings between

women-owned small businesses and government ocials.

In 2021, there were more than 2,300 total attendees for

ChallengeHER webinars.

We also hosted Contract Connections for the ninth year at the

2021 Business Class LIVE virtual event for small business

owners, connecting many underrepresented-owned small

business suppliers with large corporate and government

buyers in one-on-one sessions. We continued to offer small

business owners’ access to Business Class, a platform offering

customized business education resources. We also maintained

our support of Minority- and Women-Owned Business

Enterprises (MWBEs) as part of our capital markets funding

and share repurchase programs. In 2021, we engaged four

MWBEs for underwriting and share repurchases, and through

May of 2022, we engaged six such MWBEs.

We have a goal to provide at least 250,000

underrepresented-owned small- and medium-

sized US businesses access to capital and

nancial education from late 2020 through 2024.

BACKING OUR COMMUNITIES

Advancing racial equality and social justice in our communities starts with our business ethics and

extends through our partnerships, grants, and community investments worldwide.

Investing in organizations that are addressing

inequality and promoting social justice

To support DE&I efforts in the communities where we live

and work, we have a goal to provide $50 million in grants from

late 2020 through 2024 to nonprots focused on addressing

inequality and promoting social justice, including those led

by members of underrepresented groups. Since late 2020,

we’ve provided more than $14 million in grants so far to these

organizations.

Some examples of the initiatives we supported in

2020–2021 include:

Social purpose leadership training for diversity
organizations, including Hispanics in Philanthropy, Public

Allies, the Council of Urban Professionals Institute,

Americans for Indian Opportunity, National Urban League,

and Leadership Education for Asian Pacics (LEAP)

Leadership programs that support women leaders in the
nonprot sector, including with The New York Women’s

Foundation

The New York City LGBTQ+ Historic Sites Project, run by the
Fund for the City of New York

Development programs supporting visually impaired leaders
with the American Foundation for the Blind

Initiatives with the First Nations Development Institute
addressing the immediate and economic needs of Native

American communities disproportionately impacted by

COVID-19 and food insecurity

Backing equal futures

We support organizations that are reducing economic, health,

educational, and racial disparities through our new Backing

Equal Futures grantmaking pillar. In 2021, this support

included grants to the NAACP Legal Defense & Educational

Fund, The Hispanic Scholarship Fund, and NAF (formerly the

National Academy Foundation). In addition, we’ve also

established strategic partnerships with organizations such as

United Negro College Fund (UNCF), the Thurgood Marshall

Fund, and HBCU Connect to provide career readiness

programming and access to internships and full-time career

opportunities to Historically Black College and University

(HBCU) students and alumni.

BACKING LGBTQ+ YOUTH

IN OUR COMMUNITY

American Express has supported

the Trevor Project since 2019.

As the world’s largest suicide

prevention and mental health

organization for LGBTQ+ young

people, the Trevor Project works

to save young lives by providing support through free

and condential suicide prevention and mental health

programs. The organization also runs TrevorSpace,

the world’s largest safe space social networking site

for LGBTQ+ youth, and operates innovative education,

research, and advocacy programs.

Our grant funding of $250,000 is supporting the

Trevor Project’s international expansion of crisis

services to Mexico and an LGBTQ+ advocacy strategy

in the United States. Through this strategy, the Trevor

Project aims to meet vulnerable LGBTQ+ youth with

life-saving support across multiple fronts.

Cultivating a more diverse generation

of future leaders

American Express has invested approximately $100 million

since 2007 to help more than 165,000 social purpose

leaders reach their potential. The American Express

Leadership Academy builds the personal, business, and

leadership skills of emerging nonprot and social purpose

leaders through multi-day trainings. In 2021, we continued

to support our partners and participants by hosting 11

virtual programs for over 500 leaders from 11 countries. We

also pledged to increase the representation of individuals

from underrepresented groups among US participants from

50% in 2019 to 75% by 2024. We have already exceeded our

goal, achieving 76% participation by individuals from

underrepresented groups in 2021.

In 2021, we joined with NinetyToZero, an initiative focused on

combating the 90% racial wealth gap between white and

Black Americans, which is expected to complement and build

upon our 2020 partnership with OneTen, an organization

whose mission is to hire, promote, and advance one million

Black individuals who do not have a four-year degree into

family-sustaining careers over the span of 10 years.

We also participate in the Business Roundtable’s Multiple

Pathways Initiative (MPI), which seeks to reform companies’

hiring and talent management practices to emphasize the

value of skills, rather than just degrees, and to improve

equity, diversity, and workplace culture.

RECOGNITION FOR OUR COMMITMENT TO HISPANIC AND LATINX COMMUNITIES

“ I’m proud that we put our service ethic

to work to empower local leaders and

organizations, like the Hispanic

Federation, that are tackling some of

society’s toughest challenges. Making

a positive difference in the lives of our

customers, business partners, and

our communities, is something we take

very seriously. It’s what drives us.”

 MONIQUE HERENA , CHIEF COLLEAGUE
EXPERIENCE OFFICER, AMERICAN EXPRESS
“ For over 20 years, American Express has

supported Latino causes by providing

funds to help prepare Latino youth for

long-term educational success, offering

disaster relief assistance in times of trouble,

and promoting the economic stability

of Latino communities. Beyond nancial

support, American Express is a true

partner to our communities.”

 FRANKIE MIRANDA , THE HISPANIC SCHOLARSHIP
FUND, PRESIDENT AND CEO, HISPANIC FEDERATION
American Express was recognized with the Hispanic Federation’s

2022 Corporate Leadership Award in recognition of our track

record of supporting Hispanic and Latinx causes in the areas of

giving, volunteerism, and diversity. We have a long-standing

partnership with the Hispanic Federation and in 2021 alone, we

committed $2 million over four years to support the Hispanic

Federation’s Latino Capacity Building Institute and its COVID-19

Emergency Assistance Fund—initiatives that are helping Latino

nonprots grow and respond to pressing community needs.

We also committed $1 million over four years to support The

Hispanic Scholarship Fund, with youth leadership initiatives,

college education, and mentoring programs.

Supporting vital community services for

underrepresented groups in Australia

American Express backs communities through local action

on a global scale. For example, as the pandemic impacted

education worldwide, many children, especially from under-

represented groups, faced the risk of being left behind.

We helped address this situation for Australia’s Aboriginal

and Torres Strait Islander communities by supporting the

Australian Literacy and Numeracy Foundation to continue

delivering its Early Language & Literacy Program through

digital innovations, enabling over 1,500 children to date to

make critical progress in their oral language and early literacy

development. The program is one of the many ways we back

this community and demonstrates our commitment to

reconciliation as part of our Reconciliation Action Plan.

MINIMIZING OUR CLIMATE IMPACT

We believe we have a role to play in supporting the transition to

a low-carbon economy and have been working toward advancing

climate solutions on multiple fronts:

Advancing climate solutions starts with our own operations.

Since 2018, we have been a CarbonNeutral® company, powered

by 100% renewable electricity across our global operations.^5

To build on these efforts, in 2021 we committed to net-zero

emissions by 2035 in alignment with the Science Based

Targets initiative (SBTi). We are also working to enhance the

management of our climate-related risks and opportunities

across our business and became a formal supporter of the

Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).

In 2020 and 2021, we conducted a qualitative climate risk

scenario analysis to assess physical and transition risks to our

business related to climate change in alignment with the TCFD.

We assessed transition risks associated with current and

emerging regulations, technology advances, and market and

reputational impacts and identied opportunities, including

developing new low-carbon products and services for

customers. Additionally, ESG risks–in particular climate

risk–have been included as an emerging risk for the

company, and are part of our Enterprise Risk Management

(ERM) framework. Climate-related risks are currently

managed as part of our ERM process. The Risk Committee

of our Board of Directors provides oversight of our ERM

framework, processes, and methodologies, and approves

our ERM policy, which governs risk governance, risk oversight,

and risk appetite.

We have also continued to leverage programs like

plastic that received a certication as a CarbonNeutral®

product in accordance with The CarbonNeutral Protocol.

To support more climate-resilient and equitable communities,

we launched a goal to provide at least $10 million from

2021 through 2025 to support initiatives, partnerships, and

programs that address the adverse effects of climate change

and pollution on communities.

Read on to learn how we’ve progressed, and what we still

aim to do, in order to:

Minimize our climate impact
Manage our climate-related risks and opportunities
Develop new capabilities to enable our customers and
partners to transition to a low-carbon economy

Support community programs and initiatives to help
build more climate-resilient and equitable communities

In May 2022, we closed

our rst-ever ESG bond

issuance. We intend that an

amount equivalent to the

net proceeds of the $1 billion

ESG bond will be allocated

toward projects in the

Green and Social categories,

including investments in

green buildings and

initiatives supporting a

circular economy.

JOINING FORCES FOR

LOWCARBON COMMUNITIES

Advancing climate solutions globally requires a

collaborative approach, so in April and May 2022,

we announced new partnerships with nonprots.

Through grants to American Forests, C40 Cities,

National Park Foundation, and Earthwatch Institute,

we plan to fund projects and initiatives to support

nature-based solutions and sustainability efforts

in local communities, particularly in urban areas.

Partnering with these organizations is another

important step in our objective to advance

climate solutions.

In 2019, we set a goal to have 60% of

the total square footage of leased or

owned facilities actively occupied by

American Express be green building

certied by 2025. Since the beginning

of 2019, we have spent more than

$150 million on the development of

facilities that have received green

building certications.

MOVING TO NETZERO

We support the shift toward a low-carbon economy, in line with the science-based

recommendations of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

In 2021, we maintained CarbonNeutral® certication across

our global operations, including oces, eld sites, and data

centers, in accordance with the CarbonNeutral Protocol,

a leading third-party framework, and our operations remained

powered by 100% renewable electricity.^6 Following on these

steps, we have committed to net-zero emissions by 2035 in

alignment with the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi).^7

We made this commitment based on the SBTi’s most

ambitious level of climate action, to limit global warming to

1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. In signing on

to the Business Ambition for 1.5°C and the UN Race to Zero

Campaign, American Express is among a growing roster of

more than 1,400 companies setting targets to the 1.5°C goal.

Since our operations are already carbon neutral, we will focus

on our supply chain and work with our vendors, encouraging

them to establish their own science-based emissions

reduction targets and track, reduce, and eventually neutralize

their operational greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

2025 operational environmental goals

In 2019, we set operational environmental goals for 2025

that cover energy and water use, waste generation, green

building certications, the phaseout of single-use plastics, and

responsible paper sourcing; in 2021, we made progress on these

goals. However, our reductions in energy, waste, and water were

also greatly impacted by oce closures due to the pandemic

and we expect usage to increase as colleagues return to the

oce. While progress toward our operational environmental

goals will not be linear, we expect to continue to make important

advances to meet them over the next few years.

Operations include all our managed facilities, eld sites, and data centers. Managed facilities are individual properties operationally managed by our global real estate team and housing critical business functions.
Field sites are individual properties that are not operationally managed by our global real estate team but directly by our business units. They are typically smaller sites, less than 30,000 square feet (including airport
lounges, foreign exchange kiosks, and sales oces), that are owned or leased by American Express. The company’s goal to remain carbon neutral covers Scope 1 (direct emissions from sources owned or controlled by
American Express), Scope 2 (indirect location-based and market-based emissions), Scope 3 emissions (Category 5 waste generated in operations and Category 6 business travel) through renewable energy credits,
carbon offsets, and reduced GHG emissions.
American Express is following the methodology of the SBTi for our commitment to net-zero by 2035, which covers all Scope 1 and 2 emissions and a minimum of two-thirds of total Scope 3 emissions in conformance
with the GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard.

Making progress in energy eciency and

Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions

In 2021, we continued to implement energy eciency initiatives
including lighting retrots, HVAC equipment upgrades, and new
building control systems, which are expected to save approximately
1,500 MWh of energy use per year. Due to these measures and the
reduction in energy demand due to temporary work-from-home
arrangements, energy consumption in the facilities we manage in 2021
decreased by approximately 57% compared to our 2011 baseline.
We use several measures in addition to energy eciency measures to
help mitigate GHG emissions from our global operations, including
onsite solar electricity generation, energy attribute certicates (EACs),
and carbon offsets.

Since 2018, we have powered our global operations with 100%

renewable electricity. In 2021, we produced approximately 561 MWh
of renewable solar electricity at our North Carolina data center and
Brighton, UK oce and we purchased 202,170 MWh of EACs. EACs
verify the production of renewable electricity in an amount equivalent
to the total electricity consumption and we purchase in alignment
with the technical guidance from RE100, a global coalition of leading
businesses committed to using 100% renewable electricity.
We also purchased 22,770 MTCO2e of carbon offsets in 2021, including

wind power development, reforestation, and forest conservation
projects. These projects offset our emissions from activities such as
fuel consumption, as well as Scope 3 emissions from colleague business

travel, and the waste generated in our operations.

Data centers are critical to the smooth operation of our

business. They also represent approximately 850,000

square feet of our building space and in 2021 used

approximately 114,826 MWh—around 55% of the

electricity that powers our operations. Our data centers

produce 40% of our total Scope 1 and Scope 2 carbon

emissions.

Solar panels on our North Carolina data center generated

approximately 546 MWh of solar electricity in 2021, and

energy eciency measures across all our data centers

have saved an estimated 3,600 MTCO2e in 2021. Our data

centers report a power usage effectiveness (PUE)^13 of 1.62

for our production data center,^14 1.59 for our redundancy

data center,^15 and 1.72 for our testing data center.

At our data center in Gurgaon, India, we implemented

several energy eciency and sustainability measures in

2021, including installing high-performance thermal

insulation that meets India’s Energy Conservation

Building Code (ECBC) standards and reduces external

heat gain, and equipping the UPS (Uninterruptable Power

Supply) system with high-eciency modular units.

RENEWABLE ENERGY AND INCREASING ENERGY EFFICIENCY AT OUR DATA CENTERS

The PUE is the total overall utility load divided by the total load needed to support the data halls. We collect data from strategic metering devices within our building systems as well as our Energy Performance
Management System (EPMS) which reports real-time PUE data.

Optimizing our workspaces

As we work to reduce our energy use, maintain carbon

neutrality, and nd ways to reduce the environmental impact

of our real estate footprint, we strive to design, build, and

operate facilities that consume less resources, emit fewer

greenhouse gases, and improve the quality of the indoor

environment for our colleagues’ well-being.

We seek to follow sustainability best practices, including

the U.S. Green Building Council’s Leadership in Energy and

Environmental Design (LEED) certication program and other

international green building standards including BREEAM,

NABERS, GreenMark, HQE, and Energie+.

In 2021, 25 of our facilities in 14 countries, representing

approximately 56% of our global real estate portfolio, have

achieved green building certications, progress that puts

us closer to meeting our goal of achieving green building

certications for 60% of our operations in 2025.^16

We work to improve the sustainability and comfort of our

oce with ergonomic furniture and sustainable construction

materials based on LEED standards. We also allocate workspace

and remote work capabilities in ways designed to offer our

colleagues exibility and to use our real estate eciently.

Balancing sustainability and safety during

the COVID-19 pandemic

As detailed earlier in this section, we made substantial

progress against our operational environmental goals for

However, our reductions in energy, waste, and water
across our global operations continued to be impacted

by oce closures due to COVID-19, health and safety best

practices during the pandemic, and adoption of more

exible work arrangements for our colleagues. Because

these changes impacted performance on our operational

environmental goals against our 2019 pre-pandemic baseline,

we have temporarily suspended reporting our performance

against our colleague waste and water and single-use plastics

goals and we are reviewing our methodologies in relation to

these changes.

Building attendance remained very low worldwide through

Following best practices to support colleague health and
safety during the pandemic, we removed reusable items from

our cafeterias. In 2020 and 2021, to ensure we followed best

practices to support health and safety during the pandemic

and as a result of COVID-19-related building closures, we

temporarily suspended tracking performance against our

single-use plastic goal across our operations.

As colleagues return to the oce and water usage, energy

usage, and waste generation increase, we will examine data

and building attendance to give us more accurate insights

into our performance against pre-pandemic baselines.

Engaging, educating, and making improvements

to decrease water use

In 2019, we set a goal to reduce water consumption at our

managed facilities by 10% per colleague by 2025. We are

working toward this goal through colleague engagement and

education and building design, such as low-ow xtures and

automatic water faucets in our newly-opened oce building

in Phoenix.

In 2021, we consumed 166,171 cubic meters across our global

operations, 72% lower than 2019 and substantially impacted

by oce closures and work-from-home arrangements due to

the pandemic.

Sharpening our focus on waste reduction

and management

Four of our 2025 operational environmental goals are designed

to reduce and divert landll-bound waste and to phase out

single-use plastics. We launched several initiatives in 2019 to

support these goals, including a composting program at our

New York headquarters. We have had to adapt some of these

activities to meet COVID-19-related safety protocols, including

the reintroduction of single-use paper cups in our oor

pantries, although we have nevertheless seen a reduction in

total waste generation, due in large part to oce closures and

work-from-home arrangements. In 2021, we diverted 54% from

landlls compared to 52% in 2020.

ALIGNING CLIMATE EFFORTS

TO GLOBAL BEST PRACTICES

We aim to align our efforts with global best

practices among the numerous standards and

frameworks that have emerged for measuring

climate impact and action and promoting

accountability for businesses.

In addition to our commitment to net-zero

emissions by 2035 in alignment with the Science

Based Targets initiative, we joined the Business

Ambition for 1.5°C and Race to Zero, established

by the UN to rally leadership for a zero-carbon

recovery. We are also a member of RE100, a global

initiative of large businesses committed to using

100% renewable electricity.

Further, we became a formal supporter of the

Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures

(TCFD), whose recommendations inform how we

assess physical and transition risks and opportunities

for our business.

Learn more about how we are assessing and managing
climate risk in the TCFD Index.
Maintaining resiliency and business continuity

To maintain resiliency and business continuity in our oces

and data centers we factor climate-related physical risks into

our short-, medium-, and long-term real estate strategies.

One of our newer buildings in Sunrise, Florida, for example,

is designed to withstand Category 5 hurricanes and major

ooding events. In addition, we evaluate qualitative climate-

related transition risks that may impact our global operations,

including current and emerging regulations. These climate-

related risks inuence our operational strategy and we have

identied opportunities to minimize these risks, including

by maintaining carbon neutrality and continuing to invest in

energy eciency projects and renewable electricity.

Operating an environmentally and socially

responsible supply chain

In 2021, we sourced 96% of our direct marketing, customer

communications, and oce paper from certied responsibly

managed forests, working toward a goal of 100% in 2025.

We’re committed to working with suppliers who share our

values regarding diversity, ethical sourcing, and responsible

operations, including environmental sustainability, human

rights, and gender equality.

BACKING OUR COLLEAGUES

Engaging our colleagues through Green2Gether

Engaging our colleagues in sustainability initiatives through

the Green2Gether program is an important goal of our ESG

strategy, and we engage thousands of our colleagues during

the year, offering workplace climate education, waste and

energy reduction efforts, and volunteer opportunities with

non-prot partners.

Volunteer-led Green2Gether activities range from beach

cleanups to recycling drives to innovative virtual Earth Day

campaigns during the COVID-19 pandemic. Every April during

Earth Month, colleagues around the world can participate in

dozens of company-sponsored activities, such as recycling

drives, online lectures, community clean-ups, and sustainability

awareness campaigns.

In 2021, we engaged colleagues virtually to support the

planting of 100,000 trees in partnership with The Nature

Conservancy’s Plant a Billion Trees campaign, funding

approximately 210,000 trees in total since 2017. In 2022,

colleagues have engaged in environmentally-focused

in-person and/or virtual volunteer activities and events with

The Central Park Conservancy, United Way of Salt Lake City,

South Downs National Park (UK), PRIDE+ Network, Compass

Group, Catchare, and others.

CONNECTING OUR COLLEAGUES

Innovating low-carbon products and services

Our customers and partners want to understand their

environmental impact, reduce their carbon footprint, and play

a part in the transition to a low-carbon economy. Across the

company, we’re enhancing our capabilities to support them.

For our corporate clients, we offer tools such as our Carbon

Offset Referral Suite. The suite launched in June 2022 and

provides US corporate customers with a curated list of carbon

offset providers who can help them manage their footprint via

offset solutions that include investments in large-scale carbon

removal and reduction projects and avoidance projects.

This year, we’re developing new offerings as we work toward

our goal to pilot low-carbon product innovations by the

end of 2022. With our Shop with Purpose program, which

won our enterprise-wide Innovation Challenge in 2020,

we provided customers with special promotions through

Amex Offers with select Certied B Corp™ companies

and other brands committed to making a difference during

Earth Month in 2022.

BACKING OUR CUSTOMERS AND PARTNERS

As climate action increases in importance for our customers and partners, we’re exploring new

ways to deliver responsible products and services, help our customers make informed decisions,

and promote responsible travel and conscientious consumption. To reinforce this, in 2021, we set

a goal to pilot low-carbon product innovations by the end of 2022.

Methodology: This Amex Trendex online poll was conducted by Morning Consult between February 3-11th, 2022 among a national sample of 2,000 US and 1,000 travelers in Japan, Australia, Mexico, India, UK, and Canada
who have a household income of at least $70K and dened as adults who typically travel by air at least once a year. Results from each market’s survey have a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
American Express’ Carbon Footprint Tool calculations are derived by applying selected conversion
factors to spending made with the following American Express Corporate products: Corporate Card,
Business Travel Account, Corporate Meeting Card, Corporate Purchasing Card, Buyer Initiated
Payments, vPayments and Amex Go. The estimated information provided by the Carbon Footprint Tool
is for generalized informational purposes only and does not constitute nancial, tax, accounting, legal

Promoting a circular economy and expanding recycled plastic cards

To reduce the company’s consumption of virgin plastic, in 2019,

we launched the rst American Express Card manufactured

primarily from reclaimed plastic collected from beaches and

coastal communities. Since then, we have set a goal for the

vast majority of plastic cards issued by American Express be

made from at least 70% recycled or reclaimed plastic by the

end of 2024. By achieving this goal, we can help avoid nearly

160,000 pounds of virgin plastic from being used annually.

To support this goal, we have already begun expanding our

offerings to integrate recycled plastic into our card materials.

In summer 2021, we launched our rst card made from

recycled PVC in Canada. In 2022, we announced that France

will become the rst market to shift to recycled plastic for

almost all of our plastic cards.

Additionally, as an example of collaboration with our strategic

partners to collectively support our sustainability goals,

we partnered with Delta Air Lines on the Delta SkyMiles

American Express Cards made from 70% reclaimed plastic

that achieved CarbonNeutral® product certication. In 2019,

we launched our Card Take Back Program that enables US

Card Members to return both plastic and non-plastic cards

by mail for recycling. Since the launch of the program, we’ve

recycled more than 1.3 million cards, including cards returned

by Card Members.

Partnering to create a sustainable, low-carbon future for travel

Travel is a key part of our services and heritage. Our ESG

efforts in this area start at home by offsetting our carbon

footprint associated with employee business travel—

including third-party air, rail, and rental cars. To reduce

the impact of executive travel, for example, we continue

to scale up our use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in

our corporate jet eet.

In 2021, we partnered with the World Economic Forum on

several initiatives. As a member of the World Economic

Forum’s Global Future Council on Sustainable Tourism, we are

working with government, business, and academic leaders

to advance innovation on inclusive and sustainable tourism.

We are also a member of the World Economic Forum’s

Clean Skies for Tomorrow Coalition, which supports efforts

to transition to sustainable aviation fuel and achieve carbon

neutral air travel across the aviation sector. We also signed on

to the Clean Skies for Tomorrow 2030 Ambition Statement,

to accelerate the supply and use of sustainable aviation

fuel technologies to reach 10% of the global jet aviation fuel

supply by 2030.

Additionally, through our Global Insights and Advisory Team,

we offer our large and global corporate customers data-driven

insights into the changes in business travel due to the

pandemic, data that can help benchmark their existing travel

polices against their peers and reporting on considerations

on the environmental impact of business travel generally.

Our backing is expected to help fund the continued

development of the Overture, Boom’s agship

product. The Overture is anticipated to be able

to run on up to 100% sustainable aviation fuel,

including biofuels manufactured using renewable

materials, and other low-carbon fuel technologies.

We also became a founding member of the Boom

BACKING OUR COMMUNITIES

We seek to advance climate solutions through programs and initiatives

that help build more climate-resilient and equitable communities.

In 2021, we set a goal to provide at least $10 million in support by the end of 2025 for

initiatives, partnerships, and programs that address the adverse effects of climate change

and pollution on communities. To support this goal, we launched a new community giving

priority: Backing Low-Carbon Communities.

Community giving to advance low-carbon and nature-based solutions

Backing Low-Carbon Communities grants support nature-based solutions, community-led

climate initiatives, and disaster response and resilience efforts in local communities, particularly

in urban areas. Since last year’s announcement of our philanthropic commitment of $10 million

by 2025, we have provided $3.1 million in grants to help back low-carbon communities,

including grants to:

American Forests to support its
Tree Equity program by bringing more
native and climate-resilient trees to

four US cities where American Express

has oces: Phoenix, New York, Salt

Lake City, and Sunrise, Florida.

The grant will provide support to

help identify and increase local tree

nurseries, plant urban forests, and

create entry-level jobs to help

historically marginalized populations

transition into the tree care industry.

Additionally, the grant will help

expand Tree Equity Score to its rst

international location, a tool that

indicates whether neighborhoods

have enough trees for everyone to

experience their health, economic

and, climate benets.

“ We are grateful for the incredible commitment American Express has made

to support Tree Equity and climate resiliency in cities. The work we’re doing

together will boost the supply of trees that communities need to equitably

cool and cleanse the air in their neighborhoods and create local jobs in the

process, even giving us the capacity to expand this work to other countries.”

 JAD DALEY , PRESIDENT AND CEO OF AMERICAN FORESTS

In 2022, we announced $3.1 million in

grants to American Forests, the National

Park Foundation, Save the Children UK,

C40 Cities, and Earthwatch Institute to

support nature-based solutions and

sustainability efforts in local communities,

particularly in urban areas.

C40 Cities to fund its efforts to develop consumption-based

emissions inventories in New York City and London to inform

a suite of actions to incentivize more sustainable consumption

in collaboration with people and businesses. The project is

also expected to pioneer new ways for other cities to measure

emissions from urban consumption. Announced in May 2022

by New York City Mayor Eric Adams and C40 Chair and

Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, this partnership will help both

cities in delivering C40’s Good Food Declaration by providing

data and insights to increase access to nutritious food and

reduce food waste.

Earthwatch Institute to fund the planting of a Tiny Forest
in the United Kingdom, helping to mitigate the impacts of
climate change and enhance biodiversity. The grant will also

provide planting, maintenance, and monitoring volunteer

opportunities to our colleagues and support the creation of

a Climate Change Master Class for our colleague base. The

class, led by scientists, will provide education and tools to

help our colleagues reduce the impacts of climate change.

Supporting resilient communities globally

We continued to fund disaster relief and response efforts

around the world, as we have for many years. To build on

these efforts, we are providing support for disaster relief

and resilience building programs and initiatives to help

create climate-resilient communities in extreme weather

prone areas and cities where our colleagues and customers

live and work. These grants aim to build capacity for

mitigating the impacts of climate change, focusing on areas

such as land management, water stewardship, climate

resilience and adaptation, and education.

RALLYING INTO ACTION

AFTER EXTREME

WEATHER EVENTS

As extreme weather events disrupted communities
worldwide throughout 2021, we were there to help with
more than $650,000 for disaster response, working with
organizations such as the Red Cross, Feeding America,
and the International Medical Corps. Our support focused
on addressing the immediate needs of those who have
been injured or displaced, providing temporary shelter
and meals for rst responders and affected families,
distributing clean-up supplies, and connecting affected
people to mental health support, COVID-19 supplies, and
other assistance.

Through these partnerships and resources, we backed

communities in need in connection with the following

extreme weather events and natural disasters:

Floods devastated Germany and Western Europe
Multiple tornadoes swept across the Midwest and Southern US
Winter storms resulted in widespread power outages in Texas
Hurricane Ida brought catastrophic wind damage, rain,
ooding, and dangerous tornadoes to the US Gulf Coast

and Northeast

Wildres in California destroyed hundreds of homes and
businesses and forced citizens across the state to evacuate

A 7.2 magnitude earthquake resulted in widespread damage
and left thousands in need of support in Haiti

We engage our colleagues by matching eligible

colleague contributions toward disaster relief

through the American Express Match program,

recommending charities, and connecting US

colleagues to information about becoming an

American Red Cross disaster response volunteer.

In Sierra Leone, Save the Children U.K.
is conducting research in 20 highly
climate-vulnerable communities along
the coastline. The goal is to provide
ideas to enhance opportunities for
innovation and sustainable income
generation in the coastal community.
A special emphasis is to ensure women
and youth have access to new skills,
networks, markets, and institutions
to become more climate-resilient and
enhance sustainable development.
SUPPORTING CLIMATE ACTION GLOBALLY

To help ght the impact of climate change on the most vulnerable populations across Asia and Africa, we have partnered

with Save the Children U.K. to develop and execute programs that engage youth to help reduce food insecurity exacerbated

by climate change, support climate-resilient economic development and skills training through green job opportunities, and

strengthen early warning systems to help these communities better prepare for extreme weather events.

As part of these activities, we announced a $600,000 grant to support Adolescent Skills

for Successful Transition, an educational program on sustainable practices and products,

and to fund the development of a Green Climate Fund pipeline

for youth-led climate adaptation projects.

BUILDING FINANCIAL CONFIDENCE AND RESILIENCE FOR

OUR COLLEAGUES, CUSTOMERS, AND COMMUNITIES

At American Express, building nancial

condence—for our colleagues, our customers,

and in our communities—is a natural extension

of our role as a global nancial services leader

and is a core pillar of our ESG strategy.

Our efforts to build nancial condence start at home with our

colleagues. Through competitive benets, nancial support

such as additional contributions to US colleagues’ retirement

accounts, and skill-building opportunities like our Harvard

Leadership Edge program, we are helping our colleagues build

their nancial condence and resilience.

For our customers, we’re empowering individuals to build

and maintain their nancial well-being through products and

services, such as MyCredit Guide and Score Goals and our

new all-digital US consumer checking account. We also

continue to support local small businesses through initiatives

like Shop Small and Small Business Saturday.

In our communities, we are helping build resilience through

grants, programs, and initiatives that support economic

empowerment and equity. We are expanding our reach into our

communities through partnerships, such as our Backing Small

grant programs that support economically vulnerable small

business owners, and an expanded global partnership with

Junior Achievement Worldwide to provide nancial literacy

education and training to students in 11 countries. Through our

American Express Center for Community Development (CCD),

we provided $265 million in community development loans

and investments in 2021 that supported small business needs,

job creation and retention, and affordable housing.

We are excited to share progress against our goals and

highlights from our new and longstanding programs. You’ll

also learn about how we are addressing common challenges

within our industry, from strengthening data privacy and

security to protecting our customers against fraud.

Read on to learn more about how we have been helping our colleagues,
customers, and communities build nancial condence.

Building nancial knowledge and providing

planning resources

Whether planning for college, buying a home, or budgeting

daily expenses, smart saving pays off. We help our colleagues

build their knowledge and skills for all life stages through our

global Smart Saving programs.

In the US, this includes nancial planning coaching sessions

and workshops, retirement webinars, and on-demand access

to nancial education resources, as well as offers for savings

on everyday expenses.

Through our nancial planning partner, Goldman Sachs

Ayco Personal Financial Management (Ayco), we provide

US colleagues access to Ayco’s Financial Wellness program

which includes a digital platform, one-on-one guidance from a

nancial coach as well as nancial planning webinars offered

throughout the year. We connect US colleagues to digital

tools and resources to help their nancial decision-making

on topics ranging from debt management, benets,

retirement, investing, tax planning, and estate planning.

US Colleagues can also track their income and spending

habits and work with a coach to make goals and a plan to

achieve them. We also partnered with certain of our colleague

networks in 2021 and held network-specic workshops

to educate, encourage coaching sessions, and promote

the platform.

For the third consecutive year, we helped our US colleagues

manage their student debt through the SAVEtember and

Smart Saving Student Debt Programs. These programs

provided 300 colleagues with student debt a $500 cash award

once they completed a nancial wellness assessment and

attended a nancial well-being webinar on managing student

loan debt. Through the American Express Scholarship

Program, we also help American Express colleagues in the

US and Canada fund their children’s undergraduate college

education through scholarship awards based on nancial

need that range from $2,000 to $4,000 per year. In 2021,

these scholarships totaled over $365,000.

Encouraging retirement savings

Retirement funds are a great way to build nancial condence

for the future. For US colleagues, we match 100% of 401(k)

contributions up to 6% of total pay after six months of service,

and all matching contributions are immediately vested.

For 2021, US new hires were automatically enrolled at 3% of

total pay, with a 1% automatic annual increase up to 10% of

total pay. For 2022, US new hires are automatically enrolled

at 6% of total pay. Those previously enrolled at 3%, will be

brought up to 6%, and will continue with an annual automatic

increase of 1% up to 10% of total pay.

Resources that keep careers growing

Professional growth and development are another important

aspect of nancial condence. Our investment here starts

with opportunities for colleagues to learn on the job, build

cross-functional skills, and grow in their careers through a

dened, collaborative process for performance management.

Colleagues have access to a wide variety of resources: career

coaching, mentoring, professional networking, and rotation

opportunities, as well as courses on demand and with

classroom-style instruction. Since 2018, our New People

Leader Program, for example, has helped more than 3,000

rst-time managers through the executive level prepare for

their new roles.

When analysts, team leaders, managers, and directors sought

hands-on, customized ways to build their leadership skills, we

responded with Harvard Leadership Edge. Based on colleague

feedback, this eight-week program is grounded in our

Leadership Behaviors, with self-guided lessons colleagues

can apply on the job. Over 1,500 colleagues enrolled in our

rst 2021 offering of Harvard Leadership Edge.

We also made available to colleagues LinkedIn Learning, a

platform that provides quick and easy access to thousands

of online courses and videos. The platform offers lessons in

seven languages on topics including leadership, business

skills, technology, and personal development.

Expanding our long-term efforts to back small businesses

Supporting small businesses worldwide

through Shop Small

We launched Small Business Saturday in 2010 to help

independent retailers and restaurants gain more customers

in the wake of the nancial crisis. Over the past 12 years, the

campaign has evolved into a tradition for consumers and

merchants across the United States. US consumers reported

spending an estimated $163 billion^4 at small businesses on

Small Business Saturday since the movement started, and

2021 marked a record year, with an 18% increase in total

estimated projected spending from 2020.^5

Shop Small has grown into a global, year-round movement. To

address the challenges of the pandemic, we strengthened our

support even more. In 2020, we committed more than $200

million to jumpstart spending at small businesses, and in 2021

committed $100 million to our Let’s Go Shop Small campaign.^6

Small Business Saturday’s impact expands beyond the

merchants and individuals making purchases on one particular

day. In the American Express 2021 Small Business Saturday

Consumer Insights Survey, 70% of survey^ respondents reported

that Small Business Saturday makes them want to encourage

others to shop at small, independently owned retailers, too.^7

This spend statistic is an aggregate of the average spend as reported by consumers who shopped small on Small Business Saturday in surveys commissioned
by American Express reporting spend habits on Small Business Saturday since 2012. It does not reect actual receipts or sales. Each such survey was conducted
online among a nationally representative sample of US adults. The data was projected from the samples based on then-current US Census estimates of the US
adult population (18+).
The American Express 2020 Small Business Saturday Consumer Insights Survey was conducted by Teneo on behalf of American Express and the National
Federation of Independent Business (NFIB). The study is a nationally representative sample of 2,572 US adults 18 years of age or older. The sample was collected
using an email invitation and an online survey. The study gathered self-reported data and does not reect actual receipts or sales. It was conducted anonymously
on November 29, 2020. The survey has an overall margin of error of +/- 2.0%, at the 95% level of condence. Projections are based on the current US Census
estimates of the US adult population, age 18 years and over.

businesses through products, services, campaigns, and initiatives, and empowering individuals

to build and maintain their nancial well-being through products, services, tools, and education,

while providing robust account security.

Our small business resources also responded to specic challenges and needs outside

the United States.

In Japan, we collaborated with a delivery
platform on discount offers, used crowd-

funding to drive support for small restaurants

impacted by the pandemic, and provided

sanitization tool kits to help small business

owners welcome their customers safely.

In the UK, consumers reported spending
an estimated £598 million at small

businesses on Small Business Saturday,

held December 4, 2021.^9

In Canada, approximately 145,000 Card
Members enrolled in Shop Small offers,

driving 582,000 redemptions at more than

90,000 merchants in 2021.

In Australia, American Express has given
$24 million and more than 1.5 billion points

back to Card Members through Shop Small

offers from 2013 through 2021.

MAKING A BIG IMPACT FOR LOCAL BUSINESSES WORLDWIDE

Our agship Shop Small campaign encourages consumers worldwide to

support their local independent businesses. To address the challenges

of the pandemic, we committed more than $100 million to encourage

customers to support small businesses as part of our Let’s Go Shop

Small campaign in 2021.

In the UK, for example, our research showed that targeted social media drove UK consumers

to spend more with small businesses. To connect consumers and merchants, we created an

online map and shared Social Spotlights of four independent businesses in London. Overall,

UK consumers reported spending an estimated £598 million at small businesses on Small

Business Saturday in the UK.^9

In Australia, thousands of businesses took

part in Shop Small, including many micro-

businesses. “The resilience that Australian

small business operators have shown

throughout the COVID-19 crisis has been

extraordinary. And it’s encouraging to see

consumers, big business, and government

rallying to back the sector, but now is not the

time for complacency,” says Lisa Belcher, Vice

President of Small and Medium Enterprises

for American Express in Australia. “That’s why

Shop Small is returning to remind shoppers

that if they want to see these businesses

survive, they have to take action and spend

with them regularly.”

Estimated spend based on data collected from 4,000 UK adults polled by market research agency Opinium between 5pm on Saturday 4 December 2021 and 10pm
on Sunday 5 December 2021. The £598 million gure for national spending calculated using ONS estimation of the UK adult population based on self-reported
shopper estimates of spend and does not reect actual receipts or sales.

Educational resources to support

small business growth

Our global network of Customer Care

Professionals is just one way we have our

customers’ backs. Small and mid-size rms

often lack the time, tools, and resources to

pursue business growth opportunities or gain

new skills and expertise. Business Advocacy

programs such as Business Class address this

need through lifestyle-like content and

experiences, including articles, events, video

series, Instagram Live content, and more—all

available to business owners at no cost.

In 2021, we debuted the rst season of a new

video series called Business Class: The Series

that takes viewers around the world and

across industries to learn real-life lessons

from fellow entrepreneurs. Episodes explore

different ways to approach everyday business

challenges including leadership, nance,

marketing, strategy, and managing growth.

We made learning interactive with two

new seasons of “Oce Hours”—casual

and informative conversations taking place

live on Instagram, where entrepreneurs and

experts answer business owners’ questions

and offer advice. To help thousands of small

businesses owners network and grow their

capital and customers budgets, we hosted

our annual free, Business Class LIVE event,

where they virtually connected with and

learned from leading thinkers, business

executives, and entrepreneurs.

Our powerful backing for the

restaurant community

In 2019 we acquired the restaurant booking

platform Resy and together we help restaurant

businesses thrive.

Throughout the pandemic, we supported

independent restaurants by providing fee

relief and digital tools to help them run their

businesses, data-based insights to help

restaurants plan smarter, marketing and

programming to back the restaurant

community, and incentives for Card Members

to order take out.

As the impacts of the pandemic continued in

2021, American Express and Resy responded

with a series of initiatives to drive customers

to small independent restaurants to help

with their recovery and long-term growth. In

February 2021, we launched the Order In, Help

Out campaign that encouraged consumers to

make #TakeoutTuesday a weekly occurrence

and introduced new dining offers on certain

American Express Cards.

In 2022, we followed up with “Every Resy

Counts,” a reservation drive as part of the

Shop Small campaign that encouraged

millions of people across the country to dine

at independent restaurants in March 2022.

The “Every Resy Counts” initiative is part

of our broader “Let’s Grab a Table” Shop

Small marketing campaign which was

focused on bringing attention and support

to independent restaurants throughout the

United States. To help these restaurants rally

their customers, we created complimentary

toolkits with content, social media posts,

signage, and more, as well as specially

curated offers, and videos and articles from

industry experts to help them grow and

manage their businesses.

“ The industry is starting to see

the effect of the past two years.

And that’s when companies like

Amex and Resy step up huge to

say, this has to change. We have

to be there for the industry.”

Helping individuals improve their nancial health with condence

Building nancial condence opens doors for people to enrich their lives.

One of our ESG objectives is to empower individuals to build

and maintain their nancial well-being through products,

services, tools, and education. In fall 2021, we announced two

new goals: to provide access to credit to at least four million

individuals from underserved or underrepresented populations

from 2021 through 2025, and provide at least ve million

individuals with tools, resources, and educational content

to improve nancial well-being from 2021 through 2025.

We seek to make available nancial education resources and

nancial literacy programs to young people, rst-time credit

users, and experienced credit users who want to improve

their nancial management skills. Our efforts are also

focused on product transparency, responsible marketing,

non-discrimination throughout the credit lifecycle, and

robust privacy and security programs.

Expanding our reach in nancial

management and education

With MyCredit Guide and Score Goals, we helped millions

manage their credit. Free to all consumers on our website,

MyCredit Guide provides one-stop access to a user’s

VantageScore® 3.0 credit score, as well as a detailed

TransUnion personal credit report and a credit score

simulator to see how actions like paying down debt or

opening a new account could affect their score. Users can

also sign up for instant email alerts for any changes in their

credit reports.

Through our US-based Credit Intel Financial Education

Center, we help consumers enhance their knowledge

about building credit, understanding credit reports, and

understanding different types of credit cards, features, and

benets. The site shows how credit scores work—and how

to improve them.

4.5M

As of May 1, 2022, MyCredit

Guide had more than 4.5 million

enrolled users. In 2021, the

Credit Intel site attracted 2.8

million unique visitors—up from

1.1 million in 2020.

JOINING FORCES WITH INNOVATIVE STARTUPS

To connect people worldwide to new and innovative ways of building their

nancial condence, Amex teamed up with Zogo Financial Education.

When college student Bolun Li realized how little his peers

knew about nancial literacy topics like taxes and insurance

deductibles, he responded with a solution tailored

specically for his generation: Zogo Financial Education,

an app designed to make nancial education about debt

repayment, health insurance, homebuying and more, fun.

In 2021, we partnered with Zogo on a pilot program to offer

custom-tailored content and additional incentives embedded

within the app’s gamied experience. This joint effort

provided Gen Z users with an opportunity to gain valuable

nancial literacy skills toward their nancial well-being.

Amex Ventures also invested in the startup BodesWell

in 2020, and American Express and BodesWell later

co-developed and launched the pilot product My Financial

Plan in 2021, a self-service nancial planning tool designed

to give Card Member users a complete picture of their

nancial health and help them make and work toward

major life goals, such as buying a house or retirement.

The pilot launched in July 2021 and has provided select American Express Card

Members with the opportunity to try out My Financial Plan, to see how income, assets,

expenses, liabilities, and cash ow come together for planning life events.

Helping global consumers gain access to credit in the US

Many newcomers to the United States lack access to US credit due to their international credit

histories being “stopped at the border.” Since 2019, we’ve been backing the efforts of San

Francisco-based ntech Nova Credit to address this problem.

Nova Credit’s Credit Passport® seamlessly and securely integrates

into the American Express online card application process, enabling

applicants’ credit records from certain international credit reporting

agencies to be instantly translated into a US-equivalent credit report and score in just a few

clicks allowing American Express to make an application decision.

This industry-rst integration has helped thousands of newcomers from Australia, Canada, India,

Mexico, and the UK access their credit reports and get approved for an American Express Card.

In December 2021, we expanded the application’s reach to people from four more countries:

Brazil, Dominican Republic, Kenya, and Nigeria.

“ Our work with American Express over the past two years has shown us the

sheer impact access to nancial services has on newcomers. Nova Credit

now has the ability to help even more newcomers experience nancial

success as they navigate the tumultuous process of immigration—

supporting our ultimate mission for newcomers to arrive and thrive.”

Cybersecurity and customer privacy

Our customers trust us with their valuable nancial and

personal information.

Data protection: Our Data Protection and Privacy Principles
guide how we collect, use, store, share, transmit, delete,

or otherwise process customers’ personal data. With

cybersecurity threats on the rise, we continue to enhance

our information security program. Our information security

program is designed to identify risks and protect the

condentiality, integrity, and availability of our data, as

well as our information systems. We also maintain an

enterprise-wide incident response program.

Privacy: Our Privacy Statement describes how we collect,
use, and share data when customers use our online or

mobile products and services, and the choices they can

make related to marketing, sharing, and targeted advertising.

We inform our customers about the personal information

we collect, and the choices they have related to the sharing

of personal information, through product-specic privacy

notices. Our website’s Privacy Center also provides US

customers with transparent, simple-to-use resources.

Merchants who used our Enhanced Authorization

process to identify parties on the other end of a

nancial transaction typically saw fewer false

positives and fraud reduction of up to 60%.

We enhance our monitoring tools, controls, and policies for

fraud detection and prevention with our “closed loop”

relationships with Card Members and merchants. We have

access to information at both ends of the card transaction and

build algorithms and other analytical tools designed to identify

and reduce fraud. Our integrated payments platform allows us

to analyze information on Card Member spending while

respecting Card Member preferences and protecting Card

Member and merchant data in compliance with applicable

policies and legal requirements.

Continued advancement in fraud prevention

American Express maintains industry-leading fraud rates

among major card networks through practices that engage

customers and merchants, respond to escalating threats,

leverage new technologies, and more.

We ran a Card Member Fraud Education campaign in 20 20

and 2021 that used social media to teach customers how to

stay vigilant against attempts to steal online login credentials,

card details, and other personally identiable information.

For businesses, our wholly-owned subsidiary Accertify

launched Refund Abuse Protection in 2021, which is designed

to help merchants mitigate fraudulent refund requests. This

complements and augments the capabilities of Digital Identity,

which Accertify introduced in 2020 to help businesses

address fraudulent online account openings and takeovers.

Across payment channels, we continue to invest in more

secure connections and authentication mechanisms. For our

US customers, we deploy behavioral analytics that can help

identify and stop fraud during the application process.

Protecting our customers

American Express has maintained

the lowest US fraud rates among

major card networks for the past

15 years, according to the

February 2022 Nilson Report.

BACKING OUR COMMUNITIES

Building nancial condence is important in the communities where we live, work, and operate. To

this end, we’ve created goals to support economic empowerment and equity through grants,

programs, and initiatives.

We’re proud of our progress so far. Toward our goal of

investing $500 million in building more resilient and equitable

communities from 2021 through 2025, we have underwritten

$265 million in community development loans and

investments in 2021 through The American Express Center

for Community Development (CCD). These funds support

small business needs, job creation and retention, and

affordable housing, including the development of more than

1,900 units of affordable housing.

We also continue to expand our Backing Small initiative,

including $17 million in funds committed through 2024 to

support underrepresented and economically vulnerable small

business owners and entrepreneurs and includes grant

programs, mentoring support, and technical assistance

through established community partnerships.

Programs include:

The Coalition to Back Black Businesses
Backing Historic Small Restaurants
Backing International Small Restaurants
Inclusive Backing
Blueprint: Backing BIPOC Businesses in Canada
First Nations Business Growth Program in Australia
Backing underrepresented-owned businesses:
American Express and the US Black Chambers, Inc. worked

together to expand ByBlack with the launch of the rst

national certication program exclusively for Black-owned

businesses. First created as an extensive directory of

Black-owned businesses, this no-cost digital platform

now unlocks more ways to reach new customers and

secure contracts for Black-owned businesses across the

United States. ByBlack provides businesses an approved

accreditation and enables consumers and other companies

to easily nd US-based Black-owned businesses.

The Coalition to Back Black Businesses (CBBB),

founded in partnership with the U.S. Chamber of

Commerce Foundation and four national Black

chambers, is now in its third year. In February 2022,

amid supply-chain disruptions and the continuing

pandemic, we announced that an additional 491

Black-owned small businesses across 39 states were

each awarded a $5,000 grant as part of our multi-year,

$10 million commitment and are eligible to apply for

enhancement grants of $25,000 annually.

Backing Small for underrepresented and economically

vulnerable small business owners

Our Backing Small grant programs help build inclusive

economic growth and empowerment in our communities

by supporting capital, nancial education, literacy

programs, mentoring, and training for underrepresented

and economically vulnerable small business owners

and individuals.

Highlights include:

Backing Historic Small Restaurants: This campaign
supports restaurants that contribute to their neighborhood’s

unique history and identity as they face ongoing challenges

resulting from the pandemic. To qualify, restaurants must be

small and/or independently owned, located in a historic

building or neighborhood, and have been in business for at

least 25 years.

We rst launched this initiative in February 2021, working

with the National Trust for Historic Preservation to help

small restaurants that have contributed to the fabric of

their communities so they can better serve their customers,

nancially recover, and grow their businesses. In March

2022, we announced a second round of Backing Historic

Small Restaurants with the National Trust for Historic

Preservation to award $40,000 grants to another 25

historic small restaurants throughout the United States.

Backing International Small Restaurants: This new grant
program with the International Downtown Association

Foundation brought our support for small restaurants to

the international stage, supporting independent restaurants

in London, Mexico City, Sydney, Tokyo, and Toronto with

community signicance, operated by underserved

populations or in economic need.

Through our Backing Small initiative, we provide nancial support and resources to economically

vulnerable small business owners.

BACKING COMMUNITY CAFÉS IN BRIXTON AND ‘REBEL IN THE KITCHEN’ IN MEXICO

As part of the Dine Local program, run by the International

Downtown Association and Brixton BID, and supported by

American Express, 10 independent Brixton restaurants

received £5,000 grants to make critical improvements to

drive their business forward. Among the recipients is Lounge

Brixton, which is supporting local artists by expanding its live

performance space; Papa’s Café, a park-based community

cafe serving local residents; and family-run restaurant Banh

Banh Café, that plans to use the grant money to install new

kitchen equipment.

In March 2022, the IDA and the Placemaking México

Foundation, supported by American Express, announced

ten restaurants in Mexico that would receive the equivalent

of $7,500 in Mexican pesos for adjustments and renovations

to support their operations as part of the Backing

International Small Restaurants program. One of the

recipients is Doña Vero. Located at Colonia La Roma Sur, the

eponymously named restaurant is a Mexican kitchen concept

that combines pre-Hispanic and traditional avors together

with exotic and nutritional ingredients. The restaurant, run by

its namesake, brings inclusion to gastronomy, running special

tastings for people with disabilities and supporting local

causes and businesses.

Inclusive Backing: Our Inclusive Backing grant program, in partnership with Main Street
America, will provide 330 grants of $5,000 each to small business owners located in

older or historic commercial districts across the country. The program will give priority to

businesses that have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic and give preference

to businesses owned by underrepresented groups, including people of color, people with

disabilities, women, and others.

SUPPORTING ECONOMICALLY VULNERABLE SMALL

BUSINESSES

In February 2022, we launched the second of four grant cycles as part of the Inclusive

Backing grant program in partnership with Main Street America. “Services that Back Us”

will support small businesses in the personal service industry in the US that were deeply

affected by the pandemic as early shutdowns and changing consumer behavior impacted

foot trac and revenue. The program awarded 75 personal service industry small

businesses in older or historic commercial districts with a $5,000 grant to be used toward

critical needs such as physical and digital improvements, new equipment, technology, and

training to support their nancial recovery and growth.

The Inclusive Backing grant program with Main Street America will provide more than

300 grants of $5,000 each throughout 2022 over four cycles, including the “Services that

Back Us” cycle described above. The program will give preference to businesses owned by

underrepresented groups, including members of the LGBTQ+ community, people with

disabilities, Veterans, women, and people of color.

INCLUSIVE BACKING FOR VETERANS

“ I am a retired U.S. Army and Pennsylvania Army National

Guardsman and together, my wife and I created our

business as a mom-and-pop hoagie shop. Most sandwich

shops around here are franchises, so we wanted to bring

something special to our local community. Community to

us is everything—we have customers who travel hours to

our shop because they heard about us from a friend and

customers can buy a meal and place it on our “pay it

forward” board which will go toward the less fortunate.

But between the pandemic and the current challenges

met by ination, this Inclusive Backing grant has been

incredibly encouraging. A portion of the grant will be

used to build a wheelchair ramp so we can offer a more

inclusive environment and additional funds will be used

toward insulation and re-siding to make the shop more

energy ecient because with costs continuing to rise,

we need to save money where we can.”

Inclusive Backing for AAPI-Owned Small Businesses

Our Inclusive Backing grant program, in partnership with Main

Street America, is part of our Backing Small initiative to

support small business owners.

In February 2022, we announced the rst 75 grant recipients

who identied as members of the Asian American and

Pacic Islander (AAPI) community or persons with disabilities.

Four of these small business owners who are members of

the AAPI community shared what these grants mean for

their businesses.

“ This is a grant that will help us keep our doors

open while we continue to serve our community,”

says James Dong, Owner of Last Minute Gear in

San Francisco.

Arianne Wing talked about being able to carry on the heritage

of the L.T. Sue & Co. Tea Room & Emporium, her family’s

multigenerational restaurant in Hanford, California’s China

Alley Historic District.

For Irene Tsukada Simonian—Owner of the Bunkado gift shop

in Los Angeles’ Little Tokyo, the grant “validates all of the hard

work that I put into this as well as my parents and my aunt and

uncle who started this business.”

“ It’s encouragement. It’s recognition,” says Ming-Yu

Wu, Owner of the Wicked BAO restaurant in

Fernandina Beach, Florida. “It means that someone

out there is supporting the AAPI community.”

FACILITATING ACCESS TO MENTORS AND MORE IN CANADA

For small businesses, mentorship can be a valuable tool for

solving dicult business challenges—and it’s a resource

that many Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC)

entrepreneurs in Canada lack. In a survey we commissioned

of Canadian business owners, close to half (48%) of BIPOC

respondents reported that they lacked mentors to help

solve dicult business challenges, compared to just 32%

of white entrepreneurs.^11

We responded with the Blueprint: Backing BIPOC Businesses™

mentorship and grant program. The mentorship program, made

possible by a grant from the American Express Foundation,

brought in seasoned mentors and subject-matter experts

to talk about topics ranging from strategic planning and

leadership to operations management and nancial modeling.

One hundred participants from British Columbia to

Newfoundland took part in group workshops, one-on-one

coaching, and small group learning sessions.

“ As a Black entrepreneur, I’ve always struggled with not

only raising capital but nding a mentor and other BIPOC

entrepreneurs to connect with,” says Harry Julmice, Owner

of the Montreal-based content and production agency Never

Was Average. “Through the Blueprint program, I’m hopeful

that the mentorship component will help me save time,

resources, and energy by providing me with the tools,

guidance, and support I need to achieve my goals and build

a sustainable business,” he adds.

“ Women make up such a small percentage of Canadians

working in the construction sector, and one of my goals is

to help reduce some of those barriers to entry,” says Miyoko

Oikawa, Owner of Toronto-based construction consulting

company Building Energy Matters. “The mentor I’ve been

matched with is assisting me in my development as an

industry leader, and I’m condent that guidance will help me

pay it forward with supporting other women in the industry.”

We supplemented this effort with $10,000 grants for each

of the 100 participants to fuel the growth of their business.

In addition, all eligible businesses among the program’s

1,000-plus applicants received access to the “Launchpad for

Blueprint” online skills development platform.

Each one of the 100

participants received a

$10,000 grant to fuel the

growth of their business.

$10K

This survey was conducted by The Nielsen Company on behalf of American Express from April 9 to April 29, 2021, among 1,124 Canadian business owners or partners in small or medium enterprises, 596 of which
self-identify as Black, Indigenous or a Person of Color (BIPOC) and 528 of which self-identify as white.

Funding homes and inclusive real estate development

Housing is key to community resilience and nancial condence. Our contributions to

the Equitable Path Forward loan fund provide capital, grants, and program support to

BIPOC and other historically marginalized developers in the real estate and community

development industry. The CCD has also invested in a 39-unit affordable housing

development in New Mexico. Units are reserved for members of the Mescalero Apache

Tribe, with 20% of the project’s units for tribal members who are homeless or at risk

of homelessness.

Supporting nancial literacy for K-12 students

We formed a new partnership with the Council for

Economic Education (CEE), whose mission is to

equip K-12 students with the tools and knowledge

of personal nance and economics so that they

can make better decisions for themselves,

their families, and their communities. Our latest

grant will support teacher training in low- or

middle-income schools, nancial literacy events

for parents and their children, and presentations

to students at community organizations

supported by American Express.

Helping students around the world

Our global partnership with Junior Achievement Worldwide will provide nancial literacy

education and training to students in 11 countries including Canada, India, Hong Kong, Japan,

and Mexico. The program’s main objectives include cultivating the attitudes and behaviors that

young people need to become nancially capable, focusing where possible on under represented

and underserved communities. We plan to leverage our colleague volunteers to help teach and

mentor students as part of the program and we expect the Junior Achievement Worldwide

program to reach over 5,000 students.

Working together to expand nancial literacy

Across the US and around the world, nonprots are at work helping to make communities and

individuals more nancially resilient. American Express partners with several of these nonprots,

using our resources to help extend their reach and amplify their impact.

OUR CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK

Strong corporate governance starts at the top with diverse, experienced leadership,

a culture of openness and accountability, and a comprehensive, considered structure of

policies and practices.

Our Corporate Governance Principles set the course for an

ethical approach to business. Our Board of Directors and

management review them to ensure they are appropriate

and reect our high standards and Blue Box Values.

When recommending updates, the Board’s Nominating,

Governance, and Public Responsibility Committee considers

our shareholders’ views, as well as publicly available

discourse on governance best practices. These principles,

along with our Code of Conduct for colleagues, Code of

Business Conduct for Members of the Board of Directors,

and the charters of our Board’s four standing committees

(Audit and Compliance; Compensation and Benets;

Nominating, Governance and Public Responsibility; and

Risk) make up our governance framework. Key governance

policies and processes also include our comprehensive

Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program, our

Whistleblower Claims Policy, our commitment to

transparent nancial reporting, and our strong internal

checks and balances. Comprehensive management policies,

many of which are approved at the Board committee level,

guide our operations.

Our Board of Directors, a diverse group of leaders with

substantial experience in their elds, oversees and sets

the tone for operating responsibly. We continually review

our Board’s composition to identify skills needed for the

company, both in the near-term and into the future.

The Nominating, Governance, and Public Responsibility

Committee assesses potential candidates based on their

history of achievement, the breadth of their business

experiences, whether they bring specic skills or expertise

in areas that the committee has identied as desired, and

whether they possess personal attributes and experiences

that will contribute to the sound functioning of our Board.

Diversity is also a key consideration in our nomination and

succession planning processes. Our Corporate Governance

Principles provide that the Board should be diverse, engaged,

and independent. When reviewing potential board nominees,

the Nominating, Governance, and Public Responsibility

Committee considers the holistic diversity of the Board,

including gender, race, ethnicity, age, sexual orientation, and

nationality, and does not discriminate on any basis.

Learn more about diversity at American Express in the Promoting
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion section.
BOARD MEMBER DIVERSITY

Eight (57%) of our 14 Board members are women

and/or are from diverse races or ethnic backgrounds,

including four members who identify as Black or

African American, one member who identies as

Hispanic / Latinx, and four members who identify

as women.

The Compensation and Benets Committee

of the Board also oversees performance goals

and certies performance outcomes on key

talent metrics.

The Risk Committee of the Board provides

oversight of our ERM framework, along with

the policies and procedures established by

management to identify, assess, measure,

and manage key risks facing the company,

including ESG risks, and approves our ERM

policy, which governs risk governance, risk

oversight, and risk appetite. ESG risks—in

particular climate risk—are included in our

ERM framework and climate-related risks are

currently managed as part of our ERM

process.

ESG GOVERNANCE

Our Executive Committee reviews and

evaluates ESG performance and long-term

goals with support from our ESG Steering

ESG AND EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

Our executive compensation program is designed to support the company’s longevity and

stability by driving long-term business outcomes, promoting strong governance practices, and

encouraging responsible risk-taking.

We do this by linking individual pay with company

performance on a diverse set of measures, as well as nancial

and strategic goals.

All senior executives have a large portion of compensation

that is variable and covers annual and multi-year performance

periods. The company scorecard incentivizes performance

and includes key objectives in four categories: Shareholder,

Customer, Colleague, and Strategic.

In 2021, the Compensation and Benets Committee modied

its charter to include a review of strategies relating to

diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives as well as key talent

metrics. We also increasingly link executive compensation to

our ESG goals. For example, in years past, the company

scorecard’s Colleague category included metrics for diversity

representation, talent retention, culture, and inclusion as

part of the calculation to determine incentive compensation

for all eligible colleagues.

In 2021, we also incorporated the management

of key ESG priorities, including metrics, into

our executive compensation program under

the Strategic category of our annual scorecard.

Our Board’s Compensation and Benets Committee oversees

performance goals across our categories and certies

performance outcomes.

We reinforce these values with our Code of Conduct, which

establishes our expectations for ethical workplace behavior.

The Code provides guidance on sensitive business practices

such as gift-giving, expenses, appropriate technology use,

conducting business with foreign governments, and protecting

customer privacy.

Our Blue Box Values guide how we operate as a company and include the following principles

that every colleague commits to embracing and working by each day:

OUR BUSINESS ETHICS

The Code is an essential part of our daily global operations. We

publish the Code in nine languages and require all colleagues

to take and certify an annual training on its provisions. Abiding

by the Code is a condition of working at American Express,

and violations can result in termination.

Colleagues are required to receive annual Global Regulatory

Learning requirements on important policies, laws, and

regulations that govern our industry, guide our company, and

protect our colleagues, customers, and brand.

ASSOCIATIONS, INCLUDING:
1
Empowering colleagues to report ethics concerns

We encourage colleagues, contractors, vendors, suppliers, and others to trust their instincts

and feel comfortable raising concerns, from workplace conduct to suspected breaches of

our Code of Conduct.

To raise these concerns, we provide our global Amex Ethics Hotline online and by phone 24/7,

staffed by representatives who among them speak more than 170 languages. An independent

organization hosts the hotline and reporters can provide information condentially or

anonymously where local laws allow. Specially trained individuals at American Express

promptly review all concerns raised and investigate further when appropriate.

Our Whistleblower Claims Policy allows colleagues, contractors, customers, merchants, and

others to report allegations in good faith without fear of retaliation or risk to their employment.

Claims are investigated and recommendations are made by the Colleague Experience Group,

Internal Audit Group, and Global Security, in consultation with our General Counsel’s

Organization, as appropriate.

Transparent and responsible corporate citizenship

We believe active engagement in the public policy arena is vital to the democratic process

and an important part of responsible corporate citizenship. We are transparent about our

policy engagement with governments, including through Lobbying Disclosure Act lings in

the United States.

To address global ESG issues that affect

us and our industry, like data privacy and

security, we engage with our partners and

peers through industry groups, roundtables,

conferences, and other forums. For example,

in 2021 we engaged in forums with the Data

& Trust Alliance, the Centre for Information

Policy Leadership, the Future of Privacy

Forum, the Bank Policy Institute, and the

Business Roundtable.

Protecting our corporate, customer, and colleague

information is a priority for us. With cybersecurity threats

on the rise, we continue to enhance our global security

measures. Our information and cybersecurity program is

designed to identify risks and protect the condentiality,

integrity, and availability of our data, as well as our

information systems. The program is built upon a foundation

of advanced security technology, a well-staffed and highly

trained team of experts, and robust operations based on the

National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity

Framework. This consists of controls designed to identify,

protect, detect, respond, and recover from information and

cybersecurity incidents.

Through our cybersecurity governance framework, our

internal teams report to the Board on cybersecurity at least

once a year and to our Risk Committee at least twice a year,

including at least one joint meeting with the Audit and

Compliance Committee. The full Board and committees all

receive ad hoc updates as needed and the Risk Committee

annually approves the company’s Information Security

Program. Learn more in our 2022 Proxy Statement.

Our Data Protection and Privacy Principles governs the way

we collect, use, store, share, transmit, delete, or otherwise

process our customer and colleague personal data globally.

As we innovate in fast-developing areas such as articial

intelligence and machine learning, our Global Risk and

Compliance Team oversees policies and processes that are

designed to enable us to adopt these technologies responsibly

and ethically.

Training

Every colleague at American Express is accountable for how

we protect and manage personal data about our customers,

prospects, and colleagues. We educate our colleagues about

our Data Protection and Privacy Principles through our Code

of Conduct and mandatory annual information security and

privacy training across our global operations. We also run

simulations that test our colleagues’ ability to detect and

respond to suspicious activity.

RISK MANAGEMENT

From cybersecurity threats to changes in the

geopolitical landscape, risks to our business

and operations are evolving and complex.

We follow the “three lines of defense”

approach to risk management:

The rst line owns and manages risks and
functions directly to initiate risk decision

activities.

The second line functions independently
to monitor and oversee rst line risk

management activities.

The third line, which consists of the
Internal Audit Group, provides independent

assurance that the rst and second lines

of defense operate effectively.

Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) at

American Express identies, aggregates,

monitors, and reports all risks and

establishes the Company’s risk appetite

and risk governance processes, culture, and

capabilities. Our Chief Risk Ocer oversees

risks and risk management activities across

the Company and chairs the Enterprise

Risk Management Committee (ERMC),

which oversees the Company’s governance

approach to all risks. As part of its remit, the

ERMC monitors compliance with risk appetite

limits, escalations, and resolution activities

to provide awareness of changes in the risk

prole and drives continuous improvement

of risk management processes and controls.

The ERMC also reviews key risk exposures,

trends, and concentrations and signicant

compliance issues and provides guidance

on the steps to monitor, control, and report

major risks. Our Board monitors our “tone

at the top” and risk culture and oversees

emerging strategic risks around the world.

For more information on Board and management
risk oversight, see our 2022 Proxy Statement.
Maintaining business continuity

and operational resilience

Our Crisis Preparedness Program focuses on

colleague safety and includes protocols for

safeguarding and minimizing impacts to our

buildings and assets.

In addition, our Enterprise Resilience program

addresses the maintenance of key business

operations and supporting technology in the

event of an unplanned disruption. We support

this program with expert-developed and

tested Business Continuity Plans, along with the

tools, training, and guidance.

Across our global supply chain, we assess the

resiliency of key third-party service providers

and require vendors that provide business

critical services to maintain Business Continuity

Plans. Colleagues who manage these vendors

ensure that both Business Continuity Plans as

well as potential Exit Plans are in place should

they be needed, including a list of alternative

suppliers and/or a strategy to bring the

products and services in-house if necessary.

How will climate change impact our
operations and business as we transition
to a low-carbon economy? In 2020 and
2021, we conducted a qualitative climate
risk scenario analysis aligned with the
Task Force on Climate-Related Financial
Disclosures (TCFD) framework to assess
physical and transition risks and
opportunities to our business related to
climate change.
ESG risks—in particular climate risk—
have been included as an emerging risk
for the company, and are part of our
Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)
framework. Climate-related risks are
currently managed as part of our ERM
process. The Risk Committee of our
Board of Directors provides oversight
of our ERM framework, processes,

RESPONSIBLE SOURCING THROUGHOUT

THE GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAIN

We seek to provide the world’s best customer experience

including by relying on services provided by thousands of

suppliers worldwide. We manage these vendors through our

Global Supply Management team, with a focus on meeting

regulatory requirements, managing risk across our global

relationships, and enhancing product and service offerings.

In selecting and managing suppliers, we use appropriate

due diligence and contracting requirements depending on

the relationship.

Whenever possible, our Global Supply Management team

seeks to work with suppliers from its Approved Supplier

List, which consists of businesses that have successfully

completed our risk assessment process. This process covers

screening suppliers that trigger key risks including human

rights, anti-corruption, data protection, and privacy protection.

As part of our DE&I Action Plan, we have a goal to double our

annual spend with underrepresented-owned suppliers in the

US from a 2019 baseline to $750 million by the end of 2024.

This includes increasing spend with Black-owned suppliers to

at least $100 million annually.

Learn more in Raising the Bar for Supply Chain Diversity.

Our Reconciliation Action Plan in Australia is another

example of our focus on responsible procurement. This

action plan not only reects, celebrates, and supports the

role that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples play

in the country, it also communicates our desire to work with

suppliers who share the same values related to supplier

diversity, ethical sourcing, operating responsibly (including

environmental sustainability), human rights, gender equality,

and ending modern slavery.

We guard against incidents of modern slavery and human

tracking within our business and supply chain by working

with suppliers who share our values.

See our Human Rights Statement, UK Modern Slavery Act
Transparency Statement, and Australia Modern Slavery Statement
in Key Policies in Supporting Data.
“ Delivering products and services in a fair and

transparent manner is critical to the best-in-

class customer service that we provide.”

PRIORITIZING COLLEAGUES’ HEALTH, SAFETY,

AND WELLBEING

Through our award-winning health and mental well-being

program, Healthy Living and Healthy Minds, we provide holistic

benets and maintain company policies that promote wellness.

Caring for Our Caregiver Colleagues

Since the pandemic began,

many of our colleagues took

greater roles in caregiving for

children, parents, and other

loved ones. We have helped

them manage work and life

through programs like Amex

Flex and a growing suite of

resources, including access to

BumoBrain Virtual Learning and

Bright Horizons World at Home

to help keep children engaged and learning, discounted access

to tutoring, remote sessions on caregiving, and more.

SUPPORTING COLLEAGUE

CONNECTIONS WITH OUR

COMMUNITIES

Even during the COVID-19 pandemic, we kept our

colleagues connected to volunteer opportunities that

beneted both their mental health and communities

worldwide. Our Serve2Gether Consulting Marathon,

for example, supported 14 nonprot organizations,

engaging over 80 colleagues who donated 830

volunteer hours.

“ As the Executive Sponsor of Families@Amex

colleague network, and as a devoted son to

two parents in their 90s, I know rsthand

what a labor of love caregiving can be. While

there are a range of emotions that come with

caring for aging parents, I consider it the

greatest gift to be able to support and care

for the people who have given the world to

me and my family and provided guidance

and support. So many colleagues play critical

roles in the day-to-day lives of their loved

ones. I’d encourage all caregivers to lean into

the backing, benets, and community we

have at Amex—it’s here for you in good and

challenging times.”

RESPONSIBLE LENDING

American Express is committed to responsible lending. We aim to accommodate our

customers’ spending needs while providing appropriate lending capacity, with a strong

focus on managing risk.

No single factor determines our credit decisions. For

consumer accounts, we look at credit payment history,

reported income, overall debt level compared to nancial

resources, and credit bureau scores. For commercial clients,

we consider a company’s size, nancial information, and

available reports from commercial bureaus, as well as

information from consumer credit bureaus for our small

business accounts. Our underwriting processes help us

manage both our own credit exposure and our customers’

potential risk.

We offer a variety of nancial relief options, including a

temporarily lowered annual percentage rate (APR) on our

cards, waived fees, and other accommodations for customers

enrolled in our nancial relief program. In 2020, we created a

Customer Pandemic Relief Program providing short-term

support for customers impacted by COVID-19. We also

enhanced and expanded our Financial Relief Program to

provide assistance to customers in multiple countries. We

may also refer Card Members to nonprot credit counseling

services as needed.

We seek to be transparent and fair in our customer practices

throughout the credit lifecycle. We regularly review marketing

offers and credit decisions and investigate the root causes

of customer complaints. When complaints require customer

remediation, we follow an issue management process that

is designed to deliver corrective actions and appropriate

redress. We also conduct regular colleague training on

compliance with applicable laws and regulations throughout

the credit lifecycle—including marketing, underwriting, and

collections activities—and track completion rates. In the

United States, training includes the Equal Credit Opportunity

Act and Unfair, Deceptive, or Abusive Acts or Practices.

INVESTING ACTIVITIES

As of December 31, 2021, a majority of the investment

securities on the American Express Consolidated Balance

Sheets represented US Treasuries backed by the federal

government. We are also actively backing and collaborating

with new businesses through our corporate venture group.

Since 2011, American Express Ventures has invested in

and partnered with startups to accelerate innovation for

consumers and businesses. To date, we have backed more

than 80 startups who are enhancing our own enterprise

capabilities and shaping the future of commerce, payments,

fraud prevention, data analytics, and security.

OUR COMMITMENT TO ESG

Our priority ESG issues

American Express prioritizes our ESG issues

based on their relative importance to our

business and to our stakeholders.

We updated our priority ESG issues in

2020 by completing a comprehensive ESG

materiality analysis. We collaborated with

the think tank and advisory rm SustainAbility

to guide our approach and we used the

following methodology:

Current State Assessment: We conducted
internal business research and external

benchmarking to identify the most

relevant ESG issues to our key stakeholders,

industry, and company. As part of this

process, we utilized an ESG big data

software platform to review and integrate

thousands of peer documents, regulations,

and other relevant data points. Additionally,

we evaluated leading ESG frameworks,

including the Sustainable Accounting

Standards Board (SASB), Global Reporting

Initiative (GRI), the Sustainable Development

Goals (SDGs), the Task Force on Climate-

Stakeholder Input: We utilized ndings

approach to collecting stakeholder input.

Our third-party consultants interviewed

more than 30 internal and external

stakeholders, including the Chairman and

CEO, all Executive Committee members,

shareholders, customers, strategic

partners, suppliers, nonprot organizations,

and others. We also conducted an ESG

colleague survey across 16 business units

synthesized other ESG-related feedback

received from stakeholders as part of

our ongoing engagement process. Finally,

we conducted an analysis of evolving

expectations resulting from the global

pandemic and its related impacts on our

priority ESG issues.

ESG Issues Prioritization: Using outputs from our business analysis, benchmarking, and
stakeholder engagement activities, we ranked our 20 priority ESG issues based on their relative

importance to our business and their relative importance to our stakeholders. The following

Engaging our stakeholders in ESG efforts

Our ESG commitment starts with our stakeholders:

shareholders, colleagues, customers, community

organizations, and more. To better understand the ESG issues

that matter most to them and advance our efforts to operate

responsibly, we regularly engage with our stakeholders

through a variety of channels.

Our leaders collect ongoing colleague feedback through our

annual Colleague Experience Survey, as well as open Q&A

sessions and our Colleague Networks.

We engage with our Card Members, businesses, and

merchants through customer service, direct-to-customer

channels, and social media. We regularly meet with our key

suppliers to ensure they understand current business

strategies and measures of success to meet regulatory and

company requirements. Our Lead Independent Director who

also serves as our Compensation and Benets Committee

Chair is available for engagement with shareholders, including

participating in joint corporate governance and investor

relations meetings. We deliver feedback to our Board

regarding shareholder meetings.

To address global ESG issues that affect us and our industry,

we engage with our partners and peers through industry

groups, roundtables, conferences, and other forums. For

example, in 2021, we engaged in forums with the Data & Trust

Alliance, the Centre for Information Policy Leadership, the

Future of Privacy Forum, the Bank Policy Institute, and the

Business Roundtable.

We regularly engage our key stakeholders to better understand the ESG issues that matter most to them and our business.

Their feedback informed our priority issues assessment and ESG strategy framework. Our engagement with the following eight

stakeholder groups helps us to understand and meet their expectations and advance our efforts to operate responsibly.

Stakeholder Group How We Engage

Shareholders We provide the investment community with information on our strategy, objectives, and performance on
the American Express Investor Relations website. Following our 2021 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, we
met with shareholders representing approximately 45% of our outstanding shares and other constituents
to discuss executive compensation, corporate governance, ESG, and related matters. To foster direct
communication between shareholders and our Board, our Lead Independent Director is available for
engagement with shareholders.
Colleagues We keep colleagues updated on company news, priorities, performance, and business strategies through
a variety of channels. Our leaders collect ongoing colleague feedback through our annual Colleague
Experience Survey, open Q&A sessions, Colleague Networks, and our Amex Ethics Hotline.
Customers: Card Members,
Businesses, and Merchants
We have direct relationships with millions of Card Members, businesses, and merchants around the world,
whom we engage through customer service, direct-to-customer channels, and social media.
Government and Regulators We are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision in jurisdictions around the world.
We advocate for public policy issues that are signicant to our business and our ability to serve our customers
by providing education and context to government decision-makers.
Suppliers We regularly meet with our key suppliers to ensure they understand current business strategies and measures
of success to meet regulatory and company requirements.
Community and
Nonprot Organizations
We mobilize thousands of colleagues as volunteers through our Serve2Gether and Green2Gether program
and offer incentives to support eligible charities through Give2Gether, our gift-matching program. We also
directly support and collaborate with nonprots, including through the American Express Foundation,
and help develop the nonprot and social purpose leaders of tomorrow through the longstanding
American Express Leadership Academy.
ESG Research and Rating Agencies We respond to CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project) and other ESG surveys and questionnaires
from rating agencies and indexes including EcoVadis, FTSE4Good, Sustainalytics, MSCI, and others.
Partners and Peers We engage with our partners and peers through industry groups, roundtables, conferences, and other forums
to address local and global ESG issues that affect us.

OUR ESG GOVERNANCE AND OPERATING RESPONSIBLY

Key Policies

Anti-Bribery and Corruption We have a zero-tolerance policy for bribery. All colleagues must complete anti-corruption and bribery training tied to their annual compensation that includes information on applicable laws
and regulations for their location.
Anti-Money Laundering Our global policy details our approach to preventing money laundering and related nancial crimes. Colleagues receive regular training to review our policies and requirements, relevant
laws, and their role in recognizing and reporting unusual behavior.
Code of Conduct Our Code of Conduct is our manual for informing colleagues of the workplace behaviors we expect. It covers ethical business practices ranging from anti-corruption to technology use,
conicts of interest, conducting business with foreign governments, and protecting customer privacy (see pages 67-68, 82-84).
Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) We are committed to equal employment opportunities for all individuals. We make hiring decisions based on job-related qualications and ability to perform the job without regard to race,
color, religion, sex, national origin, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, genetic information, citizenship, marital status, or any other basis prohibited by law. Our policies prohibit
harassment of colleagues and contractors by co-workers, supervisors, or outsiders and such behavior may trigger disciplinary action, including loss of employment or contract. We also
enforce a Global Sexual Harassment Policy Statement.
Human Rights We promote human rights and are committed to responsible workplace practices and protecting the human rights of people working throughout our supply chain. Our Human Rights
Statement and Code of Conduct express our commitment to fair and equal treatment of all people. We guard against incidents of modern slavery and human tracking within our business
and supply chain by conducting employment checks and by working with suppliers that meet high standards of conduct (see page 86). See also our UK Modern Slavery Act Transparency
Statement and Australia Modern Slavery Statement.
Public Policy Engagement and
Political Contributions
We believe active engagement in the public policy arena is vital to the democratic process and an important part of responsible corporate citizenship. We are transparent about our policy
engagement with governments, including through Lobbying Disclosure Act lings. We provide our perspective to ocials at various government levels worldwide and collaborate with trade
and industry associations. For more information, including lobbying requirements and our semiannual reporting of US political contributions, see our Political Contributions Report.
Responsible Marketing Our marketing programs go through multiple layers of review across business units so that our customers may be well-informed, in a responsible manner, about our products and services
(see pages 68-69).
Taxation We carefully consider our taxation positions so that they are consistent with our overall tax strategy, broader corporate governance requirements, applicable laws, and corporate values.
We engage with tax authorities globally with openness and integrity to support compliance with our tax obligations. We are a current taxpayer both within and outside of the United States.
For more information on taxation, see our 2021 Annual Report.
Whistleblower Claims Policy Our Whistleblower Claims Policy allows colleagues, contractors, customers, merchants, and others to report allegations in good faith without fear of retaliation or risk to their employment.
Claims are investigated and recommendations are made by the Colleague Experience Group, Internal Audit Group, and Global Security, in consultation with our General Counsel’s
Organization, as appropriate.

Transparency and alignment with external reporting frameworks

We use industry-leading standards and frameworks to inform our ESG activities and measure

our progress.

We align our disclosures with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), which includes

environmental, economic, and social disclosures, as well as supplemental disclosures for the

nancial services sector. It also includes general disclosures in areas such as our supply chain,

governance, ethics, and more. In addition, we use the standards of the Sustainability

Accounting Standards Board (SASB) to guide the disclosure of sustainability information of

interest to investors, including topics such as data privacy, data security, business ethics, and

more. Further, we report annually in alignment with the recommendations of the Task Force on

Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), including our approach to climate-related

governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets. We also disclose outcomes

from qualitative climate risk scenario analyses to assess physical and transition risks to our

business related to climate change.

You will nd our TCFD, SASB, and GRI indexes on the following pages of this report.

20212022 TCFD INDEX

American Express Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) Index

The Financial Stability Board (FSB), comprised of members of the G20, established the TCFD to develop recommendations for more effective climate-related disclosures. As part of our

commitment to climate action, American Express reports annually in line with the TCFD recommendations. The table below summarizes our approach to climate-related governance, strategy,

risk management, and metrics and targets. It also discloses the outcomes from the qualitative climate risk scenario analyses we performed in 2020 and 2021 to assess physical and transition

risks to our business related to climate change. In 2021, we became a formal TCFD Supporter, joining over 3,000 organizations taking action to build a more resilient nancial system through

transparent climate-related disclosure. For more information, refer to the Advancing Climate Solutions and Our ESG Governance and Operating Responsibly sections of the 2021-2022 ESG Report,

2021 Annual Report, 2022 Proxy, and 2021 CDP Climate Change Response.

TCFD Recommendation Disclosure

1. Governance

1a. Describe the board’s
oversight of climate-
related risks and
opportunities
Risk management is overseen by the American Express Board of Directors through three Board Committees: The Risk Committee, the Audit and Compliance Committee, and the Compensation
and Benets Committee. The committees meet regularly with the company’s Chief Risk Ocer, the Chief Compliance & Ethics Ocer, the Chief Audit Executive, the Chief Operational Risk Ocer,
and other senior management with regard to our risk management processes, controls, talent, and capabilities. The Board monitors the “tone at the top,” our risk culture, and oversees emerging
and strategic risks.
The Risk Committee provides oversight of the company’s Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework, processes, and methodologies, and approves the company’s ERM policy, which governs
risk governance, risk oversight, and risk appetite. ESG and climate-related risks are currently identied as an “emerging risk” within our ERM framework.
In addition, the Board’s Nominating, Governance, and Public Responsibility Committee (NGPRC) reviews the company’s ESG strategy and Corporate Sustainability program, monitors progress
against ESG goals, and provides guidance on our efforts. The Chief Corporate Affairs Ocer (CCAO), who sits on our Executive Committee, and the Vice President of Corporate Sustainability
updates the NGPRC on ESG-related issues, progress, and performance at least twice annually.

TCFD Recommendation Disclosure

1b. Describe

management’s role
in assessing and
managing climate-
related risks and
opportunities
The company’s Executive Committee reviews and evaluates ESG performance and long-term goals. Our CCAO is on the Executive Committee and reports directly to the Chairman and Chief
Executive Ocer (CEO). The CCAO oversees the Corporate Affairs & Communications (CA&C) Department and has direct responsibility for leading ESG and Corporate Sustainability initiatives,
supported by the Corporate Sustainability and ESG Team.
The Enterprise Risk Management Committee (ERMC), chaired by our Chief Risk Ocer, is the highest-level management committee to oversee all rm-wide risks and is responsible for risk
governance, risk oversight, and risk appetite, including the management of ESG and climate risks. Furthermore, a dedicated group associated with climate risk, with direct accountability to the
ERMC, has been established.
The ESG Steering Committee, chaired by our CCAO, guides our ESG strategy and related policies and programs. The cross-functional team includes senior executives from across the organization
including CA&C, Finance, Controllership, General Counsel’s Organization, Government Affairs, American Express National Bank (AENB), Global Real Estate and Workplace Experience, Investor Relations,
Global Risk and Compliance, and others that meet at least quarterly to discuss ESG topics, strategies, and initiatives to advance our ESG goals. The ESG Steering Committee is supported by ESG
Working Groups and focuses on our three ESG pillars, including Advance Climate Solutions, which develops strategies to achieve our climate goals. An additional working group focuses on ESG disclosures.
The Corporate Sustainability and ESG team, led by the VP of Corporate Sustainability, within CA&C is responsible for coordination of climate-related issues across the company. The team works
closely with business units to monitor climate-related issues and opportunities, carbon reduction efforts, energy eciency initiatives, low-carbon product innovations, colleague engagement, and
other initiatives in alignment with our ESG Strategy.
Executive compensation is also increasingly linked to our ESG goals. For example, in prior years, the Company’s annual scorecard’s Colleague category included diversity representation, talent
retention, culture, and inclusion metrics as part of the calculation to determine incentive compensation for all eligible colleagues, and in 2021, we also incorporated the management of key ESG
priorities, including metrics, into our executive compensation program under the Strategic category of our annual scorecard.
2. Strategy

2a. Describe the climate-

related risks and
opportunities the
organization has
identied over the
short-, medium-,
and long-term
American Express takes a strategic approach to managing the impacts of climate change, considering the risks and opportunities across the short-term (0–3 years), medium-term (3–6 years),
and long-term (6–10+ years). In 2020 and 2021, we conducted qualitative analyses of current and potential climate-related physical and transition risks and opportunities to our operations, supply
chain, and business activities.
Physical Risks: The qualitative climate-related physical risk assessment performed in 2020 evaluated potential acute and chronic risks and opportunities associated with the physical impacts of
climate change on key operations across several time horizons including historic conditions (1990–2018) and medium-term (2035) and long-term (2060) projections. The potential physical risks
include ooding due to sea level rise and extreme precipitation, cyclonic storm threats, drought, and extreme temperatures across the some of our critical sites. These threats could affect
operations at our global headquarters, data centers, call centers, oces, and third-party supplier card manufacturing sites.
Transition Risks: The qualitative climate-related transition risk assessment evaluated three scenarios from the International Energy Agency (IEA) to analyze the impact of transition risks on our company’s
potential future revenues and costs between 2025 and 2040. We assessed transition risks and opportunities associated with current and emerging regulations, technology advances to transition to a
low-carbon future, and public demand and reputational risks. We identied potential short-, medium-, and long-term risks including current regulations and carbon pricing; emerging regulations related to
enhanced emissions reporting requirements; shifting consumer preferences; reputational risks; increased operating costs; impacts to travel patterns; and geographic or location-based risks.
We identied climate-related opportunities in the short, medium, and long term that may have nancial or strategic impacts on our business. Opportunities include maintaining carbon neutrality,
continuing to invest in energy eciency projects, onsite renewable electricity generation, renewable Energy Attribute Certicates (EACs), and carbon offsets. Across our value chain, climate-related
opportunities exist through innovation and investments in research and development for low-carbon products and services. In addition, we have a goal to pilot low-carbon innovations by the end of 2022,
including carbon tracking and offset solutions for customers.

2b. Describe the impact
of climate-related
risks and opportunities
on the organization’s
businesses, strategy,
and nancial planning
Climate-related risks and opportunities inform our business, strategy, and nancial planning across our direct operations, products and services, funding, and supply chain. The Advance Climate
Solutions pillar of our ESG Strategy includes goals to enhance the management of climate-related risks and opportunities across our business, commit to net-zero emissions by 2035 in alignment
with the Science Based Targets initiative, and pilot low-carbon product innovations by the end of 2022.
Our strategy has been inuenced by climate-related physical and transition risks over the short-, medium-, and long-term, including those associated with emerging regulations and acute and
chronic physical risks.
Operations: Climate-related opportunities across our operations include reducing operating costs and environmental impacts at our global facilities by improving energy, water, and resource
eciency, and leveraging climate policies and tax incentives to expand onsite renewable energy. We have been a carbon neutral company powered by 100% renewable electricity across our global
operations since 2018^1 through onsite solar, renewable energy credits, carbon offsets, reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and achieved green building certication across 56% of our
operations.^2 These investments and initiatives are factored into our annual nancial planning processes.
Products & Services: To respond to changes in consumer preferences, we invest in research and development to develop and enhance our products and services. One of our Advance Climate
Solutions objectives is to enable our customers and partners to transition to a low-carbon economy through the development of new capabilities, supported by a goal to pilot low-carbon product
innovations, including carbon tracking and offset solutions, by the end of 2022.
In 2019, we launched the rst American Express Card made primarily from reclaimed plastic collected from oceans and coasts, which reduces GHG emissions and energy and water
consumption during manufacturing compared to virgin plastic. We also introduced a Card Take Back Program, which enables US Card Members to send back expired or non-working cards to
American Express for recycling. We have recycled more than 1.3 million cards since 2019, including cards returned by Card Members. In 2022, we set a goal for the vast majority of plastic cards
issued by American Express to be made of at least 70% recycled or reclaimed plastic by the end of 2024, which can help avoid nearly 160,000 pounds of virgin plastic from being used annually.
For our Corporate clients, our Carbon Footprint Dashboard is available to over 1,000 global corporate clients to help track estimated carbon emissions associated with their employees’ air travel.
We are expanding this tool to include additional categories of spend—including ground transportation, hotel stays, restaurants, and retail—letting corporate clients better understand behaviors so
they can nd opportunities to manage carbon emissions.^3 In 2022, we launched a Carbon Offset Referral Suite that provides US corporate clients with a curated list of carbon offset providers who
can help them manage their footprint via offset solutions that include investments in large-scale carbon removal and reduction projects and avoidance projects.
Funding: In May 2022, American Express closed our rst-ever ESG bond issuance. An amount equivalent to the net proceeds of the $1 billion ESG bond will be allocated toward projects in the
Green and Social Categories, informed by the American Express Sustainable Financing Framework. Green projects include those related to green buildings, energy eciency improvements and
renewable energy, and the circular economy. Social projects include initiatives connected to socioeconomic advancement and empowerment, access to essential services, and affordable housing.
Achieved carbon neutral operations for Scope 1 (direct emissions from sources owned or controlled by American Express), Scope 2 (indirect market-based emissions), and Scope 3 (waste and employee business travel, including third-party air, rail, and rental cars) emissions through renewable energy credits,
carbon offsets, and reduced GHG emissions. Operations include all our managed facilities, eld sites, and data centers. Managed facilities are individual properties operationally managed by our global real estate team and housing critical business functions. Field sites are individual properties that are not
operationally managed by our global real estate team but directly by our business units. They are typically smaller sites, less than 30,000 square feet (including airport lounges, foreign exchange kiosks, and sales oces) that are owned or leased by American Express.
Green building certied percentage is represented by the total year-end square footage certied out of total year-end building square footage. This includes leased or owned facilities actively occupied by American Express (excluding parking lot square footage) that have achieved certication under a global or
locally recognized third-party environmental building certication system as meeting their performance criteria (LEED, BREEAM, NABERS, GreenMark, HQE, and Energie+).
American Express’ Carbon Footprint Tool calculations are derived by applying selected conversion factors to spending made with the following American Express Corporate products: Corporate Card, Business Travel Account, Corporate Meeting Card, Corporate Purchasing Card, Buyer Initiated Payments,
vPayments and Amex Go. The estimated information provided by the Carbon Footprint Tool is for generalized informational purposes only and does not constitute nancial, tax, accounting, legal or other professional advice on any subject matter.

2c. Describe the resilience

of the organization’s
strategy, taking into
consideration
different climate-
related scenarios,
including a 2°C or
lower scenario
Our ESG governance framework, Advance Climate Solutions pillar of our ESG strategy, and qualitative climate risk scenario analyses demonstrate our progress to enhance climate risk management
and opportunities across our business. We committed to net-zero by 2035 in alignment with the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and selected this goal based on SBTi’s most ambitious level of
climate action, to limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. We leverage science-based frameworks including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and International
Energy Agency (IEA), to inform our climate-related risk identication process across short-, medium-, and long-term horizons.
We aim to minimize our climate impact and manage our climate-related risks and opportunities; enable our customers and partners to transition to a low-carbon economy through the development
of new capabilities; and support community programs and initiatives to help build more climate resilient and equitable communities.
For our qualitative climate-related physical risk assessment, we evaluated potential threats and mitigation opportunities to critical business sites across our global operations, supply chain,
and revenue sources both under historic conditions and applied to future climate projections from the IPCC’s Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 scenario. Each site was examined
for seven potential acute and chronic risks from the physical impacts of climate change: 1) increasing temperatures; 2) sea level rise; 3) precipitation changes; 4) ooding; 5) cyclonic events;
6) extended drought; and 7) extreme temperatures. For the qualitative climate-related transition risk assessment, we evaluated the impact of three future scenarios from the IEA compatible with
a 1.5°C, 2-3°C, 6°C pathway on countries essential to our business operations against 2025- and 2040-time horizons. The assessment evaluated the impact of transition risks to our potential
future revenues and costs associated with capital expenditures and capital allocation strategies over short- and long-term horizons.
3. Risk Management

3a. Describe the

organization’s
processes for
identifying and
assessing climate-
related risks
American Express management establishes risk management policies and procedures to identify, assess, measure, and manage key risks facing the company. ESG risks, including, but not limited
to, climate change risk are currently identied as an “emerging risk” within our risk governance framework.
We dene climate-related risks as:

Transition Risks: Risks related to the transition to a low-carbon economy, which may include extensive changes pertaining to policy, legal, technology, market, and reputational risks
Physical Risks: Risks related to the physical impacts of climate change, typically driven by acute physical risk such as increased severity of extreme weather events (e.g., cyclones,
hurricanes, oods) and chronic physical risks which are longer-term shifts in climate patterns (e.g., sea level rise, chronic heat waves)
Climate-related risks are interconnected and overarching across all risk types as it may manifest as credit risk, operational risk, market risk, liquidity risk, and other risk types.

To identify and assess climate-related risks, we conducted qualitative climate-related physical and transition risk and opportunity assessments to understand the current and potential impacts of
climate change to our direct business operations, supply chain, and nancial activities. We also consider current and emerging climate regulations, technology, legal, and reputational risks and
qualitative factors such as disruptions to our operations, impacts on our colleagues, and damage to our brand.

3b. Describe the

organization’s
processes for
managing climate-
related risks
ESG and climate-related risks are managed as part of our comprehensive ERM program. Risk management is overseen by our Board of Directors through its Risk Committee, Audit and Compliance
Committee, and Compensation and Benets Committee, each of which provide regular reports to the full Board regarding matters reviewed by these committees. These committees meet regularly
with our Chief Risk Ocer, Chief Compliance & Ethics Ocer, the Chief Audit Executive, Chief Operational Risk Ocer, and other senior management with regards to our risk management
processes, controls, talent, and capabilities to monitor our risk culture and emerging and strategic risks.
The Risk Committee of our Board of Directors and the Enterprise Risk Management Committee (ERMC) provides oversight of our Enterprise Risk Management framework, processes, and
methodologies, and approves our Enterprise Risk Management policy, which governs risk governance, risk oversight, and risk appetite.
ESG risks—in particular climate risk—have been included as an emerging risk for the company and are part of our Enterprise Risk Management scope. A dedicated group associated with climate
risk, with direct accountability to the ERMC, has been established.
Additionally, the Nominating, Governance, and Public Responsibility Committee (NGPRC) of the Board has oversight of ESG matters including climate-related issues. The ESG Steering Committee,
comprised of senior leaders across the organization, and Advance Climate Solutions Working Group consider climate-related risks in connection with developing climate-related goals and
operational strategies.
In 2020, we completed a comprehensive assessment to identify priority environmental, social, and governance issues for our business with input from internal and external stakeholders. As a
result of this process, we ranked 20 priority ESG issues based on their relative importance to our business and to our stakeholders. Key issues identied included climate change, energy, and GHG
emissions, data privacy and security, nancial resiliency, business ethics, responsible travel and consumption, inclusion and diversity, and colleague attraction and retention.
3c. Describe how

processes for
identifying, assessing,
and managing
climate-related risks
are integrated into
the organization’s
overall risk
management
We have a comprehensive ERM program to identify, aggregate, monitor, and manage risks. The program also denes our risk appetite, governance, culture, and capabilities. ESG and climate-
related risks are currently identied as an “emerging risk” within our risk governance framework. The implementation and execution of the ERM program is headed by our Chief Risk Ocer.
The ERMC, chaired by our Chief Risk Ocer, is the highest-level management committee to oversee all rm-wide risks and is responsible for risk governance, risk oversight, and risk appetite.
The ERMC reviews key risk exposures, trends and concentrations, signicant compliance matters, and provides guidance on the steps to monitor, control, and report major risks. ERMC has also
approved the formation of the Climate Risk Management Working Group, composed of cross-functional representation with direct oversight specically to address evolving regulatory expectations
on management of climate-related nancial risks.
In addition, the Asset Liability Committee, chaired by our Chief Financial Ocer, is responsible for managing our capital, funding and liquidity, investment, market risk, and asset/liability activities
in accordance with our policies and in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.
The ESG Steering Committee, comprised of senior leadership, discuss ESG topics and climate-related risks, opportunities, and strategies to advance our ESG goals.

Transition risks and opportunities, including current and emerging regulations, disclosure requirements, legal and reputational risks, and customer requirements are considered by teams including
Global Real Estate and Workplace Experience, Global Risk and Compliance, General Counsel’s Organization, Finance, Technology, CA&C, Corporate Sustainability, and ESG Teams.
Physical risks and opportunities, including extreme weather events and natural disasters, are identied and measured for severity as part of our business continuity planning and primarily overseen
by our Global Real Estate and Workplace Experience and Technology Teams. Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity Plans are developed and updated regularly to ensure steps are in place to
identify and respond before, during, and after a service continuity event. Our facility and data center teams review these established procedures and controls, test them annually, and certify key
equipment and systems operations to ensure uninterrupted operation of our data centers during localized weather events. Our facility infrastructure is monitored 24/7 and test results are tracked
and reported. Our US-based data center facilities are ISO-certied to ensure that environmental risks and/or opportunities are identied and prioritized.

A letter from Chair and CEO Brian Moynihan

To our shareholders,

To our clients,

To my teammates,

To leaders and partners in the communities we serve,

It is my pleasure to share with you the 2021 Bank of

America Annual Report.

The following pages detail how, over the past year,
your company once again fulfilled our purpose to
make financial lives better — and did so in a way
that benefitted clients, teammates, shareholders
and society alike. Against a backdrop of the global
pandemic and its ongoing challenges, we delivered
Responsible Growth.

With that in mind, I begin this report by thanking
my 208,000 teammates around the world whose
efforts and dedication made this all possible. While
thanking my teammates overall, I particularly join
them in thanking three senior colleagues who
were instrumental in our success over the last
several years and retired at the end of 2021 —
Anne Finucane, Tom Montag and Andrea Smith.
These leaders delivered for our employees and our
shareholders and were truly great colleagues. One of
the testaments to their leadership was their work to
develop strong talent to succeed them and continue
the company’s mission. You can see on page 13
our current management team reflecting their
development efforts.

I would also like to thank our Board of Directors, and
our Lead Independent Director, Lionel Nowell III,
for their leadership. We also recognize and give our
appreciation to Tom May and Sue Bies, two directors
who are retiring and will not stand for reelection at

our annual shareholders’ meeting. Tom came to a
predecessor company’s board in 1994. He became
a board member of Bank of America in 2004 and
led our Audit and Corporate Governance, ESG and
Sustainability Committees as chair. Sue became a
board member in 2009 at the height of the financial
crisis. Both of these colleagues have provided
tremendous wisdom to all of us. Lionel offers his
perspective on our company’s performance in
2021, and his outlook for the future, on page 10.
By virtually any measure, 2021 was a successful year
for our company and you, our shareholders.
We earned a record $32.0 billion, or $3.57 per diluted
share, on $89.1 billion in revenue. We increased total
assets to $3.2 trillion as we grew deposits to more
than $2 trillion. Asset quality remained strong with
net charge-offs of customer loans nearing a 50-year
low. We maintained high levels of capital and liquidity.
For the year, our stock price increased 47%,
outpacing the S&P 500 and the broader bank index.
Whether you are a new shareholder or someone
who has held the stock for many years, our stock
has performed well. At year-end 2021, our 3-, 5-, and
10-year stock price improvement all outperformed
the broader bank index, and our 10-year performance
was over 700%.

We also increased our quarterly stock dividend by 17%.
Including share repurchases, we returned nearly $32 billion
in capital back to shareholders in 2021. In thinking about the
work your team has done, I thought the following chart would
give some perspective. Starting with our beginning base of
common equity at January 1, 2010, you will note across the
12 years, we have earned $177 billion of net income, paid
out $53 billion in common and preferred dividends, and had
net buybacks of $86 billion, for a total return of capital of
$139 billion. So while providing all the support for clients and
communities and producing these shareholder returns, our
$245 billion of common equity is still 18% stronger than the
2010 starting point. The reduction in shares outstanding is
also noteworthy, moving from 9.9 billion in 2010 to less than
8.1 billion as we ended 2021. So a shareholder who kept his or
her shares from 2010 until now owns about 18% more of the
company. And, over the same time period, our book value per
share is 46% higher.

Even with all that capital return, we still have an extremely
strong capital position, witnessed by our common equity tier 1
(CET1) ratio of 10.6%, well above our minimum requirements.

As we think about our core operations in 2021, we returned
to delivering the organic growth experienced prior to the
pandemic. Across our eight lines of business, we once again
deepened relationships with existing clients and earned the
trust of new ones. We deployed our capabilities, expertise
and balance sheet to help our clients achieve their financial
goals. We focused on the needs of our clients — one client at a
time — and held client experience scores at near-record highs.

While supporting clients, we also invested to support our
teammates around the globe, as part of our commitment
to being a great place to work. We expanded benefits and
resources to promote health, wellness and safety for our
teammates and their families. See more in the “Making our
company a great place to work” section of this letter.

We also delivered for communities to help them thrive.
We will discuss the many ways we did this throughout
this report, and we provide an update on the Stakeholder
Capitalism Metrics that we first reported upon in last year’s
report. Examples of outcomes we have delivered include:
helping business clients prepare for and transition toward
a low-carbon future, promoting greater racial equality and
economic opportunity wherever we operate, and tripling our
affordable homeownership commitment to help more low- to
moderate-income clients build generational wealth through
the purchase of a home.
All of this — and so much more — helped us achieve the
best year of earnings in company history. And we did it
all by delivering Responsible Growth.
Responsible Growth
Responsible Growth is how we drive our company.
It has four straightforward tenets:
We must grow and win in the market, no excuses.
We must grow with a customer focus.
We must grow within our risk framework.
We must grow in a sustainable manner.
And, to grow in a sustainable manner, we must drive
operational excellence, make our company a great place to
work, and share our success with communities.
In 2021, our company executed well on each of these tenets.
Here’s how we did it.
Grow and win in the market, no excuses
The acid test of our success is market share growth achieved
by both adding new clients and doing more with the clients
we have. In the years leading up to the pandemic, our
company had been delivering strong organic growth driven
by the power of our franchise and our brand, our best-in-class
relationship teams, our great products and our industry-
leading digital capabilities.
When the worldwide health crisis hit in 2020, we deployed
our resources and capabilities to meet the rapidly-evolving
financial needs of our clients, in addition to providing support
for our teammates and communities. As the economy
rebounded from the 2020 lows, we’ve seen client activity
normalize and accelerate. In 2021, we saw our organic growth
engine kick back in.
We grew deposits by $269 billion to a record $2.1 trillion.
We grew loans by $51 billion in the most recent quarter, the
fastest rate in our history — with the exception of the rapid
drawdowns on commercial lines of credit we experienced
early in the pandemic.
For retail clients, which includes our Consumer as well as
Wealth Management clients, deposits grew to $1.4 trillion
2 | BANK OF AMERICA 2021

and we retained our spot as the top bank in the country by
retail deposits. Importantly, we added nearly 1 million net new
checking accounts, which are predominantly core transaction
accounts for our clients. At the same time, we added more
than half a million new Consumer Investment accounts as
a growing number of clients chose to invest and manage
their funds through Merrill Edge, our well-established digital
investment platform. This helped Consumer Investment
assets grow 20% over the course of 2021. And we added
millions of new credit card accounts.

We strengthened our leadership positions in both our high-
tech and high-touch channels. We saw record engagement
across our digital channels, which I will discuss later in this
letter. And while digital customer behavior increased, we also
recognize the continued need for a strong physical delivery
network supporting all our businesses.

We continued our geographical financial center expansion
work in 2021, bringing our brand to new cities while also
optimizing our presence in existing markets. In 2021, we
refreshed nearly 400 financial centers and opened 8 2
financial centers, 41 of which were in our expansion markets,
including Denver, Minneapolis, Indianapolis, Pittsburgh as
well as locations in Ohio and Kentucky. We continued to gain
retail deposit market share in key markets. In 25 of the top
30 markets across America, we remain ranked the #1, #2, or
#3 bank. In 16 of those markets — more than three times the
number of our closest peer — we are the #1 bank.

We are focused on growth with efficiency, i.e., adding
branches and gaining scale in markets effectively rather than
spreading them around. For example, in Minneapolis we have
approximately $3 billion in deposits from our Retail business
and are the #7 position in the market. We did not have a retail
presence in Minneapolis prior to 2015. And average deposit
size in branches is $217 million, already 1.4 times the average
in the industry. This shows the strength of our brand.

During the year, we also continued to enhance our flagship
loyalty program, Preferred Rewards, which recognizes and
rewards clients for doing business with us across all products.
Preferred Rewards memberships grew to 9.4 million, an
11% year-over-year increase, and we once again saw 99%
retention rates from our members.

We also delivered products and personalized care to help our
11 million business owner clients achieve their financial goals.
We continue to be among the nation’s largest Small Business
lenders, ending 2021 with $22 billion in total outstanding
loans. Small Business clients benefitted from our award-
winning digital tools and the advice of Business Advantage
specialists in 2,400 financial centers.

At the same time, we continued to innovate and enhance the
products and services we offer to merchants, driving new
clients and additional volume through our Merchant Services
platform.

In our wealth management business — Merrill and The Private
Bank — we saw record client flows during 2021 of $149 billion.
Total client assets ended the year at $3.8 trillion, up 15%
from 2020. Profit margins in the business lead the industry.
Importantly, we continued to drive holistic client relationships
as deposits in our Global Wealth & Investment Management
(GWIM) business grew to $390 billion, up more than 20%.
Standalone, our GWIM business would be a top 10 U.S. bank
by deposits. Average loans also grew during 2021 to nearly
$200 billion, having grown now for 47 straight quarters, even
throughout the pandemic.
For commercial and corporate clients, we raised $963 billion
in capital in 2021 to help them build new manufacturing
facilities, hire workers, and evolve their business models
to meet future opportunities — including their transition to
more sustainable operations. So as one considers the capital
repurchases shown in the earlier chart, one might ask,
“Should we have used the capital we used for buybacks to
help our clients?” The answer is: we did that, too. During
the same 12-year period in which we returned $139 billion
of capital to shareholders, we also provided $8.6 trillion in
capital raising for our corporate clients.
Commercial loan balances grew 9% to $543 billion during
We helped companies manage their cash and saw
our Global Transaction Services revenue grow to more than
$7.2 billion. And our Investment Banking team had three of its
best quarters in the company’s history in 2021, leading to a
record $8.9 billion in investment banking fees.
In our Global Markets business, our teams also had a very
strong year amid continued market volatility. Our sales and
trading revenue of more than $15 billion was the best in a
decade. We continue to invest in this business, most notably
by deploying more than $150 billion in additional balance
sheet to support client growth.
In 2021, each of our businesses contributed to our record
results and we grew and won in the market.
Grow with a customer focus
The second tenet of Responsible Growth is to grow with a
customer focus. Our growth has to be organic: For nearly
30 years, a bank with 10% or more of the deposits in the
U.S. has not been permitted to acquire a U.S. deposit-
taking institution. Our growth comes from focusing upon
and fulfilling client needs. We focus on what they need
and the service and relationship quality we must bring to
$2.1T

We grew deposits to
a record $2.1T in 2021.
BANK OF AMERICA 2021 | 3
them to meet their needs. We also focus on all the ways to
serve — high-tech and high-touch — it is our advantage to have
massively-scaled platforms in each area.

In 2021, we saw record client engagement across our high-
tech digital platforms. Our continued growth in digital
enrollment and engagement has been instrumental to our
success in deepening client relationships while reducing costs
and driving greater efficiencies across our businesses.

In Consumer, we added 2 million active digital banking users
during 2021, the fastest annual numerical growth in digital
users in our company’s history. As of the end of the year,
we had 54 million verified users with 41 million active, i.e.,
engaged in the past 90 days. Those users logged into their
accounts 10.5 billion times during 2021. In addition to helping
clients manage their accounts, digital has been a key driver of
our sales. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2021, 86% of
all deposit transactions were digital. At the same time, 46%
of all consumer sales came through digital channels, up from
32% pre-pandemic. During the past five years, all product
sales have been fully digitally enabled to allow this growth to
happen. You can open a checking account, get a mortgage, get
a home equity loan, a credit card or invest, all through a fully
digital process.

We also see more and more clients turning to Erica®, our
artificial intelligence (AI)-based virtual financial assistant,
for help keeping up with managing their finances. In 2021,
total Erica interactions from our clients increased threefold
to 427 million. We continued to expand Erica’s capabilities
to make it easier for clients to manage their financial lives.
Erica has proven to be a critical channel in helping us deliver
important information to clients and addressing their
questions and concerns in real-time.

So what is Erica? Natural language processing, AI, data
aggregation and analysis sitting on a massive infrastructure
to deliver in real-time the “answer” to any question. But
it is useful beyond clients as it can help our teammates
work better.

Erica is also a part of our operational platform, delivering
efficiencies and reducing manual intervention to help our
client-facing teammates. For example, our Erica-driven
BankerAssist internal platform is saving our Global Banking
teams 40,000 hours of work each year, and reducing their
client response times by two-thirds.

$35B+

In the past 12 years, we’ve invested more than
$35B to build a powerful, more secure and
scalable technology platform.
The power of our digital tools is also changing the way clients
send and receive money. During 2021, the number of clients
who are active Zelle® users — both consumers and small
businesses — increased 23% to 15.8 million. These users sent
and received $231 billion in payments over the course of
the year, a 64% increase over 2020. To put our Zelle volumes
into perspective, the 779 million Zelle transactions made by
our clients during the year surpassed the number of paper
check transactions written by our clients for the first time.
So why is that important? The check numbers have dropped
more than 25% over the past two years. Not processing
paper checks saves us money to invest in other activities.
It is one of the ways we have been working to reduce the
$5 billion level of cash/check and related expense we cited
in 2017. It continues to fall. The costs get reinvested in more
productive activities.
Our digital capabilities have also been a powerful driver
of client engagement and satisfaction within our wealth
management businesses. Our Merrill clients are 79% digitally
active while our Private Bank clients are 85% digitally active.
And, we continue to make steady progress with clients
accepting paperless statements across the franchise. As
face-to-face meetings returned in part from their 2 020
hiatus, our advisors continued to leverage the strength of our
digital platforms to connect with, and address the individual
needs of, our clients. In the fourth quarter of 2021 alone, our
Merrill Lynch advisors sent 1.5 million secure messages to
our clients, and our clients signed 230,000 forms digitally —
47% of all eligible transactions. This is all simply easier for
our clients.
Our commercial clients, too, are using our digital capabilities
to manage their company’s finances from wherever they
are — and they’re doing it in record numbers. In 2021, we
saw a 55% increase in active users of our CashPro app.
With a simple tap on their phone (or even their watch), those
users — CFOs and finance leaders from companies around
the world — approved $384 billion in payments during 2021,
a 119% increase in approval volumes over the previous year.
We continue to deliver new capabilities to help support
finance operations for our commercial clients. In January
2022, we launched CashPro Forecasting, a tool that uses
AI and machine learning technology to more accurately and
efficiently predict clients’ future cash positions.
The digital strength and success we demonstrated in 2021 —
including the many industry awards and recognition we
received — did not happen overnight. It is the product of years
of investment and innovation. In the 12 years cited above,
we have invested more than $35 billion in new technology
initiatives, including code development and related initiatives,
to build a powerful, more secure and scalable technology
platform with market-leading capabilities. This platform has
helped us deliver a best-in-class digital experience for our
clients, and efficient operating platform for our teammates.
It is also a key driver in cost reduction for our company.

“The work we do to deliver

for our communities and for

society is embedded in all of our

operations and integral to how

we run our company. We call it

Responsible Growth.”

Brian Moynihan
Chair and CEO
Innovation remains a top priority for our company. In 2022, we
plan to continue by investing another $3.5 billion in initiatives
to enhance our platform, fund next-gen projects, and extend
our digital leadership into the future.

As important as our digital capabilities are, we also continue
to focus on delivering expert support and guidance across our
high-touch network. And, in 2021, we served our clients well
through our nationwide network of 4,200 financial centers
and 16,000 ATMs as well as on the phone, in our offices and
through our chat capabilities. As I mentioned before, our client
experience scores during the year held near-record highs.

I’d like to add a special thanks to my teammates working in
financial centers — our essential workers — who have continued
to serve our clients’ everyday financial needs and, in so doing,
support the economic wellness of our communities every day
in this pandemic.

Another way we grow with a client focus is by delivering an
award-winning suite of products and services tailored to our
clients’ unique financial needs. And, over the past year, we
have continued to enhance our product portfolio to support
our retail clients.
Our no overdraft account (SafeBalance™ Banking) now has
over 3 million clients. We continue to develop capabilities to
help our clients manage their money more easily. We provide
best-in-class financial wellness learning through Better
Money Habits®. We have delivered an alternative to pay-day
lending through our Balance Assist™ loan product.
Our Life Plan® capability is another key part of how we are
helping clients manage their financial lives. Life Plan helps
clients identify their individual financial goals, and allows us
to deliver personalized insight — through our mobile app and
expert advice from our specialists — to help them achieve
those goals. We launched Life Plan in September 2020 and,
BANK OF AMERICA 2021 | 5
Total net charge-offs
(billions)
by the end of 2021, more than 6.3 million clients have used
it to set goals and track their progress. It remains one of
the fastest product rollouts in our company’s history, and
is helping us build and support long-term relationships with
millions of clients.

To help guide our efforts to meet our consumer clients’ and
communities’ needs, we founded our National Community
Advisory Council (NCAC) 16 years ago. During 2021, the NCAC
continued to provide an important external perspective
to help us understand, design and deliver products to help
meet the needs of our communities — particularly low- to
moderate-income communities. We talk more about the role
of the NCAC on page 33.

Grow within our risk framework
A decade-plus of managing risk through a well-understood
framework positioned us to be a source of strength for
our clients, teammates and communities when the health
crisis hit in 2020. Against the backdrop of an unprecedented
economic decline during the pandemic, we built up significant
reserves for potential credit losses. In 2021, as the economy
recovered, we released $6.8 billion of those reserves as our
credit losses hit historic lows. Importantly, while reserves
were built in 2020 and reduced in 2021 due to accounting
rules, the credit risk in our company continues to be managed
extremely well. You can see in the chart below a 12-year
view of net charge-offs — the losses we actually take. They
reached a 50-year low during 2021.

Effective risk management means we take the right risk,
through the right processes and controls, to grow our
business while also protecting our balance sheet. It is key to

driving the type of record loan growth we saw in 2021 and
positioning ourselves for long-term success.
The right risk is also key to delivering strong results in the
markets. In 2021, our Global Markets teams navigated volatile
markets to deliver strong sales and trading results, with only
nine days of trading losses throughout the entire year. And
we supported the needs of our institutional clients through
dynamic market environments.
Recognizing and managing risk is integral to how my
teammates drive Responsible Growth every day. That applies
to the 8,000-plus teammates in our Risk, Compliance and
Audit functions as well as all of my teammates worldwide. It
is core to who we are. We continue to promote a culture of
risk management at every level of the company, and mitigate
operational risk through our focus on operational excellence.
Grow in a sustainable manner
To drive Responsible Growth, our growth must be sustainable.
That means three things. First, we drive operational excellence
so we can reinvest the savings produced in our capabilities,
our teammates and our communities. Second, we do all we
can to be a great place to work for our teammates so we can
attract and retain the best talent to serve our clients. Third,
we share our success so we can support the communities in
which we work and live.
Driving operational excellence
Operational excellence is how we create the means to reduce
costs across our platform and reinvest savings into the things
that are important to us: our team, our capabilities, our client
experience, our communities and our shareholders.

By pursuing operational excellence, we drive continuous
improvement, reduce risk, and identify faster, simpler and
more efficient ways of working and serving our clients.
Our focus on operational excellence has helped us maintain
expense discipline and reduce unnecessary jobs as the
number of clients we serve each day — and therefore the
amount and type of work our team does — has grown
significantly. For perspective, the chart below shows how
the team has effectively managed this across time. Assets
have grown $939 billion, while our headcount was reduced
26% and expense is 16% lower,^1 even after absorbing inflation
and cost-of-living type increases.

Over the same period, we have invested billions in technology
initiatives, added new sales teammates, opened more than
400 new financial centers and renovated almost 2,400 more.
And for 2020–2021, we’ve added more than $1 billion net
each year in COVID-related expenses to support the health
and safety of our teammates and ensure our company can
continue to deliver for our clients and communities.

Despite continued high levels of investment, we grew
revenue faster than expenses in the second half of 2021
and saw the return to the positive operating leverage we
experienced prior to the pandemic — when we achieved that
for 18 straight quarters. As we look to 2022 and beyond —
amid a strengthening economy and expected rising interest
rates — we expect that our success driving operational
excellence will continue to provide powerful leverage and
help us deliver for all those we serve while continuing our
investment in the future of the franchise.

Making our company a great place to work
Attracting and retaining top talent is a critical part of how
we deliver for our clients and our communities. That is
particularly true in the current tight labor market. In 2021,
we continued to invest to make our company a great place
to work for all teammates. You can read more about how
we are investing in teammates in our Human Capital
Management update on pages 38–51.
Amid the ongoing pandemic, these investments included
expanded benefits and resources to support the health and
safety of our teammates and their families. We offered free
coronavirus testing, paid time-off for teammates to receive
vaccinations and boosters, and vaccination clinics in our
offices around the world, just to name a few.
Another way we make our company a great place to work is
by fostering a diverse and inclusive (D&I) workplace. We want
our workforce to reflect the communities we serve across all
dimensions. And in 2021, we made important progress toward
that goal.
The policies we put in place around our D&I efforts help
promote transparency, accountability and continued progress.
We embed diverse representation into manager scorecards.
We use third-parties to validate equal pay for equal work.
And, importantly, we ask our teammates every year to tell us
how we are doing. In the 2021 employee survey, our employee
engagement and D&I index scores were near-record highs.

$200K+ 4%
Recognizing and rewarding performance is another priority for
us. We want teammates who are invested in our company and
our clients, and we dedicate our time and resources to help
them build long careers with us. That begins with providing
a competitive starting wage and benefits. In 2021, we raised
our U.S. minimum hourly wage to $21, on the path to our
commitment of $25 by 2025. This means that any employee
that starts work for our company makes at least $43,000
per year with some of the most comprehensive full-time
benefits available.

As I highlighted earlier, we also delivered special compensation
awards to teammates for our performance in 2021, the fifth
year we have done so. For 2021, we increased the value of
the award to $1 billion, totaling nearly $3.3 billion in special
compensation awards since 2017. Roughly 97% of our
teammates received an award this year, with the vast majority
receiving it in the form of Bank of America stock to help
them share in our long-term success. This is over and above
all other forms of compensation.

We also continue to invest in our teammates through a
progressive compensation model. Each year, teammates
with lower salaries, on average, receive higher compensation
increases as a percentage of salary when compared to
employees with higher salaries. All teammates have been
rewarded across time. The chart to the right shows the
average annual wage increases for a teammate from 2 010
through today.

Cohort Average annual increase
<$50K 8%

We continue to provide higher company subsidies for medical
premiums for teammates with lower salaries. In 2022, for
the tenth consecutive year, there was no increase in medical
premiums for teammates earning less than $50,000 per year.
For all other teammates, the average increase in medical
premiums has been less than trend growth in medical cost in
the marketplace.
So what is the payback for all this? As you can see on page 49,
our turnover rate in 2021 — the so called “great resignation
year” — was 12%, comparable to 2019, and 20% below where
we started in 2012. That difference is very beneficial to our
shareholders and our clients.
In the 2021 employee survey, our Employee Engagement and

Diversity & Inclusion Index scores were near-record highs.

8 | BANK OF AMERICA 2021

Sharing our success
For Responsible Growth to be sustainable, we must also share
our success with our communities.

Importantly, at Bank of America, the work we do to deliver
for our communities and for society is embedded in all of our
operations and integral to how we run our company. We call it
Responsible Growth.

We align all of our activities to drive progress. That means
we bring our $3.2 trillion balance sheet, our $60 billion in
annual spending, the trillions of dollars in capital we raise
each year for our clients, and the volunteer efforts of 208,000
associates to the task — in addition to our philanthropic
initiatives.

For example, we recognize the value to our business— and
to society — of diversity in our supply chain. We expect
all our vendors to promote and report on diversity in their
own workplaces. We also require U.S. vendors to provide
a minimum hourly salary of $15 per hour to employees
supporting our company. And we actively seek to do business
with certified diverse businesses through our Supplier
Diversity Program. In 2021, approximately $2 billion of our
nearly $20 billion in annual spend was with diverse suppliers.

As another example, we committed to deploy $1 trillion
in financing by 2030 — part of a broader $1.5 trillion
commitment aligned to achieving other environmental,
social and governance (ESG) priorities — to help our clients
transition to a low-carbon future. That includes financing
to help small businesses adopt more sustainable business
practices, and financing to help major corporations in all
industries transform and decarbonize their business models.
You can read more about our approach to Sustainable
Finance on page 35.

Your company is one of the largest underwriters of green
bonds, and has helped more than 225 clients support their
sustainable business needs by raising in excess of $300 billion
through more than 400 ESG-themed bond offerings. We were
the first U.S. bank to issue a corporate social bond aligned to
the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a corporate
social bond to support the fight against the pandemic, and
a corporate equality progress sustainability bond designed
to advance racial equality, economic opportunity and
environmental sustainability. We talk more about our ESG
initiatives on pages 36–37.

400+

ESG-themed bond oferings,
including the first corporate
social bond aligned to U.N. SDGs
$1.25B

We have committed more than
$300M in equity to date as part of
our $1.25B commitment to racial
equality and economic opportunity.
One of the key ways we help drive progress within our local
communities is through our market president organization.
Each of our 90-plus market presidents serves as chief
executive for Bank of America in that market. They lead an
integrated team and help us deliver one company for clients,
teammates and the broader community. You can read more
about our market presidents on page 32.
Our market presidents have also helped us identify more
than 100 high-impact minority-focused funds across
the U.S., which provide capital to Black, Hispanic-Latino,
Asian, Native American, other under-represented minority
and women entrepreneurs. With their guidance, we have
committed more than $300 million in equity to these funds
to date, as part of our $1.25 billion commitment to racial
equality and economic opportunity. These ethnic cohorts
have not been represented historically in the private equity
business as operators of the funds or as investee companies.
So this is a ‘win-win’: diverse fund managers enabled with
our investment take those funds and invest in diverse
entrepreneur-owned companies. For more information
on how we are investing in diverse entrepreneurs, see
page 34.
In 2021 alone, we made $370 million in philanthropic
investments to advance economic mobility as part of our
efforts to strengthen our communities. This included more
than $94 million to workforce development and education
programs, $87 million to support housing and small business,
and more than $81 million to meet basic needs such as
hunger relief.
Our market presidents also play an important role in helping
us deliver our philanthropic efforts at the local level.
In February 2022, working through our network of market
presidents, we announced a donation of $10.6 million — one
of the largest donations in our company’s history — to food
banks and hunger organizations across the country. This gift
was part of a broader internal company campaign to promote
health and safety for our teammates and raise awareness
about the importance of COVID-19 boosters. For every
teammate who told us they received a booster by January 31,
we donated at least $100 to a local hunger relief organization
with the majority of the organizations receiving at least
$25,000. I’d like to take a moment to thank the teammates
who helped make this gift possible, and the organizations
themselves for the important work they do within our local
communities.

A message from Lead

Independent Director Lionel Nowell

To my fellow shareholders:
On behalf of your company’s
independent directors, I want to
thank you for your investment in
Bank of America.
Your Board’s 15 independent
directors come from a diverse range
of industries and backgrounds.
Each director’s unique perspective
and expertise helps inform and
guide how your company delivers
long-term, sustainable value for our
shareholders, and in the communities
where we operate.
I would like to recognize the many
years of service of our two retiring
directors, Tom May and Sue Bies.
Tom and Sue have been great
colleagues, advisors and leaders on
our Board. We will truly miss their
wisdom and guidance.
Chaired by Brian Moynihan, your
Board oversees the company’s
strategic direction and the execution
of that strategy through regular
engagement with company leadership.
We then oversee the execution of that
strategy through regular engagement
with company leadership, including
formal committee assignments. We
work closely with company leaders
to evaluate future opportunities and
risks, and monitor how the company’s
direction and decisions align to the
four tenets of Responsible Growth,
which Brian describes in his letter.
As we reflect on 2021, we are
encouraged by the company’s
record earnings, driven by strong
organic growth, as well as the
many steps the company took to
support its clients, communities and
employees. All of these initiatives
and accomplishments position the
company well for the future.
Since assuming the role as Lead
Independent Director last year, I have
enjoyed the frequent opportunities
to meet with shareholders about
the company’s short and long-
term performance, ESG practices,
and business outlook. I value the
insights I receive when speaking
with shareholders and other key
stakeholders, and look forward
to continuing my proactive
engagement in the year to come. I
will maintain our regular update on
company progress as your Board
strives to maximize long-term
shareholder value.
Thank you again for your support and
investment in Bank of America.
Another way we share our success with our communities
is through the individual giving and volunteering of
teammates. In 2021, charitable giving by our teammates,
combined with matching gifts from Bank of America,
amounted to more than $72 million. At the same time, our
teammates reported 1.6 million volunteer hours during the
year, a reflection of their extraordinary engagement and
impact within their communities.

We also use our lending and investing activities to help
build strong, sustainable communities across the country.
In 2021, we provided $6.6 billion in loans, tax credit equity
investments, and other real estate development solutions,
and deployed $4.1 billion in debt commitments and
$2.5 billion in investments. Since 2005, we have financed
more than 263,000 housing units, of which 86% are
affordable housing.

What would you like the

power to do?
Some see a choice between “shareholder capitalism”
and “stakeholder capitalism” — a term defined by the
World Economic Forum half a century ago and adopted
by the Business Roundtable and others. But there really
is not a choice to be made. Jim Collins, the great business
writer, wrote about “the genius of the AND” in the 1990s
to describe how the most successful companies avoid
false choices in how they operate across a range of
responsibilities. So, we must do both well: continue to
deliver great returns for our shareholders and deliver for
society, i.e., the communities in which we operate.
The way we serve our stakeholders begins with one
straightforward question: What would you like the power
to do?
10 | BANK OF AMERICA 2021

Our clients tell us they want Bank of America to help them
to live their best financial lives.

Our teammates want to build long-term, rewarding careers
to help them grow and thrive and provide for their families.

Our shareholders want strong financial return on their
investment in Bank of America.

Understanding the answers to that question helps us
operate our company in a way that creates long-term value
for all those we serve.

But what if we asked that question to broader society? What
does the world want the power to do?

The answer to that question is characterized by the SDGs,
which nearly 200 countries agreed to in 2015. The SDGs
reflect 17 categories the global community views as
essential toward building a fair and sustainable future for
all, including equality of opportunity, affordable housing,
prosperity, access to clean water, and renewable energy.

I’m often asked whether the private sector is the right
cohort to address these priorities. We firmly believe so. But
as a practical matter, it is the only way progress is going
to be made. Only the private sector has the money, talent,
innovation and long-term thinking needed to deliver the
things that society wants: progress on the SDGs.

So we need to continue to align capitalism to produce the
needed progress on the SDGs or it simply won’t happen.
Here’s why:

Estimates suggest the SDGs will require between $5 trillion
to $7 trillion per year of investment capital.

Non-profits and philanthropy certainly play an important
role in delivering funding to the world, but the total
assets of all non-profit foundations in the world has been
estimated to be around $1.5 trillion. At the same time,
the sum of all annual charitable contributions in a given
year is approximately $1 trillion. Even if all of that money
was directed to the SDGs — leaving aside the many other
important causes non-profits are funding today — it would
still leave a gap of several trillion dollars per year to fund.

The public sector, too, has an important role to play,
although with budgets stretched thin — especially in the
wake of the pandemic — governments alone cannot deliver
what society demands. Some say you can make progress
happen by regulation or taxation, but those impacts tend
to be revisited, then they suffer the inevitable fate of
other governmental priorities taking the prioritization or
funding away.

The private sector must play the leading role, working in
close collaboration with all sectors of society. We must
harness the tens of trillions of dollars in available capital,
the trillions of annual expense dollars and supply chain

purchasing, the hiring, the net impact of company-specific
net-zero greenhouse gas emissions commitments and the
talent and the innovation from companies and investors
around the world. We must continue to align capitalism to
address society’s needs and to deliver for shareholders.
There’s growing awareness on how to best do that. Your
company continues to work with many organizations and
leaders around the world who are helping galvanize efforts
within the private sector and mobilize capital to address
today’s most pressing challenges.
How do we measure the progress we are making against the
SDGs? In 2020, the World Economic Forum’s International
Business Council, which I am honored to chair, together with
the Big Four global accounting firms of Deloitte, EY, KPMG,
and PwC, launched a set of universal Stakeholder Capitalism
Metrics aligned to the SDGs. These metrics help companies
across industries measure and disclose how they are
addressing societal priorities (and the SDGs) through their
business activities and operations.
To date, more than 150 companies around the world have
committed to reporting Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics and
more than 50 of them, including Bank of America, are already
including these metrics in their annual reports and other
documents. We reported on them for the first time in last
year’s annual report.
You can find our updated Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics
for this year on page 54. These metrics shed further light
on how we assess and deliver long-term value for all of our
stakeholders, and I invite you to review them in connection
with the other information in this report.
As a financial institution, our success has always been —
and will always be — dependent on the success of our clients,
the strength of our communities, and the wellbeing of our
employees. By focusing on Responsible Growth in 2021, we
delivered for those stakeholders AND drove record profits for
our shareholders. We also invested to position ourselves to
do powerful things in 2022 and beyond.
That’s the ‘genius of the AND.’
On behalf of my teammates, our management team and
the Board of Directors, I thank you for your support of
Bank of America.

(NSF) fees and reducing overdraft fees from $35 to $10. With

fee revenues by 97% from 2009 levels. These latest steps
further support our clients and empower them to create
long-term financial wellness.

In 2021 we made signifcant progress on our

journey building a modern Merrill. Advisors

helped clients navigate through uncertainty

and stay on course toward meeting their

fnancial goals, while mobilizing the power of

our capabilities to reach new milestones for

client service and Responsible Growth.

Under the leadership of Andy Sieg, Merrill continued to play
a key role in strengthening our company by focusing on the
following areas:

Comprehensive advice and planning
Merrill served its core segment of high net worth and ultra-
high net worth clients by offering more comprehensive
and personalized service across their financial lives — in
investments, planning, banking and lending. Personal
Wealth Analysis, our planning tool connecting clients’
goals to investment solutions, broadened conversations

with thousands of clients. Our clients responded by rating
satisfaction with their advisors at 94%, an all-time high.¹
Demand for banking services increased, leading to record loan
and deposit balances. We met these requests by increasing
the number of Wealth Management Bankers to more than
500 and leveraging the broad capabilities of Bank of America,
working closely with every line of business.
New digital capabilities
The bank’s investments in new digital capabilities helped
advisors deliver the industry’s leading experience for clients
at every stage of their relationships. By year-end, nearly 80%
of wealth management clients were using digital for more
of their financial needs. Even after advisors began returning
to the office, clients continued engaging digitally, while
connecting with advisors in-person as needed.
Reflecting the communities we serve
Merrill continued to promote greater diversity among our
colleagues and clients and a more inclusive culture.
We shared publicly the diverse make-up of our leadership
and advisors as well as our diversity initiatives and goals. We
believe that leading by example will benefit the industry, our
business and our clients. And we’re making good progress:
Merrill’s senior leadership team is 50% diverse,² and we’re
diversifying our advisor population overall.
Our commitment to listening to and understanding diverse
viewpoints led to one of our most important research
projects in recent years, “Diverse Viewpoints: Understanding
Affluence in the U.S.” The insights we gleaned from this
and other studies are helping us better understand how
these communities grow their wealth and underscore our
commitment to fully appreciating and reflecting the diverse
communities we serve.
Developing the next generation of advisors
Merrill is focused on helping advisors succeed at every stage
of their careers, and recognizes the importance of carrying
forward the traditions of today’s advisors who, time and
again, win top industry rankings. Last June, we launched the
Advisor Development Program, designed to train advisors
more effectively than ever, with a new emphasis on servicing
all aspects of our clients’ financial lives.
We’re targeting an 80% graduation rate — above current
industry success rates. At the end of 2021, approximately
1,000 trainees were in the program, connecting with leads
and prospects.
Continued growth
Finally, the success of these efforts to transform our business
resulted in the strongest yearly performance in our history.
Client balances rose to $3.2 trillion, we added approximately
23,300 net new households and the business recorded its
strongest net new flows of client balances ever — $122 billion.
Modern Merrill is, and will continue to be, a powerful engine
for serving clients as a core part of Bank of America.

PRIVATE BANK

A highly personalized, team-based

approach

Bank of America’s Private Bank delivers
complete investment and wealth management
solutions to ultra-high net worth clients with
more than $3 million in investable assets.
Under the leadership of Katy Knox, through a highly
personalized, team-based service, we offer clients the
insights and guidance to help protect their wealth for
generations to come.
The Private Bank performed strongly in 2021. Many of our
clients have been motivated to reassess their priorities and
legacy in light of the year’s events. Clients are looking at their
wealth, and its potential impact, more comprehensively. As
a result, over the past several years, we more than doubled
the number of conversations with clients around philanthropy,
wealth and estate planning.
This momentum is translating into strong operating and
financial performance. Total client balances rose to more
than $600 billion, and net client growth is now exceeding
pre-pandemic levels, with satisfaction among our existing
clients reaching record highs.¹
Individuals and families are also more closely considering
the impact of their giving strategy. Our clients donated
record amounts through our Charitable Gift Fund last year.
Meanwhile, our philanthropic business has seen a dramatic
increase in new commitments from non-profits and
charitable organizations seeking more advice on endowment
management, grant-making and governance over the past
two years.
As clients enjoy greater flexibility in where they live and
how they work, a record 85% are now digitally active. They
are engaging more frequently with our online and mobile
capabilities, driving increases in Erica sessions, Zelle and
digital wallet transactions. Our digital tools are increasingly an
important capability for our clients.
A leading market position to drive Responsible Growth
Clients continue to emphasize purpose-driven planning and
seek out holistic solutions for their long-term needs. With an
estimated $70 trillion of wealth expected to transfer between
generations in the next few decades, demand for wealth and
estate planning services are also expected to remain high.
Expertise in wealth structuring, trust and estate planning,
philanthropic solutions and managing specialty assets such
as art and alternative investments positions us well to meet
these evolving needs. As the largest provider of personal
trust and fiduciary administration in the U.S., we were recently
recognized as the Best Private Bank in North America.
We’ve also earned distinction for our customer service,
succession planning and use of technology to improve the
client experience.
We drive Responsible Growth by leveraging the strength of
Bank of America to seamlessly deliver our capabilities. As
clients seek a single point of access for their investment
needs, we have successfully expanded our collaboration
with Consumer Investments, placing dedicated Merrill Edge
Financial Solutions Advisors within Private Bank offices to
help address the full spectrum of our investment solutions.

Evolving landscape
In our evolving economic environment, advisory dialogue is
valued more than ever, as clients seek our thought leadership
on economic forecasts, industry trends, public policy, and
general business and consumer sentiment. Additionally,
clients are seeking macro-economic guidance to stay ahead
competitively on issues such as carbon neutrality/net-zero
greenhouse gas emissions and to adjust operations to
manage through current business challenges.

Client demand for high-quality digital solutions has
accelerated as businesses continue to transform many
aspects of their operations, with more than 80% of clients
transacting with us digitally in 2021. The past two years saw
accelerated adoption of core platforms which has increased
client expectations — from reducing time spent on routine
bank processes, such as client onboarding and document
exchange, to driving operating efficiencies that help reduce
their own employees’ time spent on manual processes.

While we have experienced record growth in client digital
engagement, clients continue to show a preference for
both in-person and virtual interactions. As we emerge from
the pandemic, we anticipate clients will seek in-person
dialogue for strategic and advisory consultation, with a
sustained preference for leveraging virtual channels for more
routine transactions.
Focused on growth
Business Banking is in a position of strength to drive financial
results for the company. Continued focus on growing our loan
and deposit portfolios can drive revenue growth and higher
net interest income.
By listening to our clients and delivering the financial advice
and strategic solutions to help them achieve their dreams, we
can deepen existing relationships and successfully capture
untapped prospect opportunity to further strengthen the
economy and the communities we serve.

Powering our communities through development
and diversity
Our clients place great value on strong, vibrant and diverse
communities, so Global Commercial Banking has developed
our business model to care for our people, our communities
and the environment.

For example, Bank of America Community Development
Banking provides financing for affordable housing and
economic development across the U.S. In 2021, we provided
more than $6.6 billion in debt and equity financing,
creating more than 11,600 units of affordable housing

for U.S. individuals, families, veterans, seniors and the
previously homeless. In addition, we also support the
long-term sustainability of communities through financial
education programs.
Clients are encouraged to consider investing all or a portion
of their excess liquidity in green or environmental, social and
governance (ESG)-friendly investment options. Additionally,
clients are taking advantage of digital treasury solutions and
moving away from paper-based solutions.
And because our clients strongly support diversity and
inclusion, we hosted GCB clients at a total of 118 diversity and
inclusion events around the world.

GLOBAL CORPORATE & INVESTMENT BANKING

Growing with and delivering

for our clients

Global Corporate & Investment Banking (GCIB)

strives to deliver integrated fnancial solutions,

capital markets execution and transformative

advice to clients across a broad range of

large corporate, middle market and emerging

growth companies.

Under the leadership of Matthew Koder, our banking teams
provide clients with solutions across the entire capital
structure and execute a broad range of transactions including
loans, leases, bonds, convertibles, IPOs, follow-on offerings,
private capital fundraising, and mergers and acquisitions,
in addition to providing best-in-class global liquidity and
treasury management solutions.

As major economies around the world recovered last year,
GCIB was committed to being a steadfast and trusted partner
with the goal of growing with and delivering for our clients, a
hallmark of our client-first culture.

Meeting both virtually and in-person, our bankers advised on
and executed a record number of investment banking advisory
and capital markets transactions with clients around the
globe. Collectively, these efforts raised $963 billion across
global capital markets, which contributed to a new high
watermark of $8.9 billion in investment banking fees in 2021,
representing an increase of 24% over the previous record set
in 2020. We see all of these achievements as a sign of our
clients’ confidence in our people, our expertise and our ability
to effectively deliver the full breadth of talent and resources
across Bank of America.

Additionally, GCIB ended the year with a record quarter of
investment banking revenues. In corporate banking, a focus
on Responsible Growth and strategically supporting our
clients saw fourth-quarter absolute loan growth pick up pace,
bringing about one of our strongest quarters ever. Average
deposits grew through the year, and especially in the fourth
quarter with a 21% year-ago-quarter increase driven by
organic growth and deal-related inflows.

A focus on technology and ESG
As technological innovation accelerates change across all
industries and the overall economy, GCIB has leveraged
technology to improve our client interactions, uncover
insights, increase efficiency and manage risk well. Recent
recognition of our continued focus on digital innovation in

2021 includes awards for Best Mobile Cash Management
Software — CashPro (Global Finance) and the No. 1 ranking in
Digital Functionality, Digital Platform Design and Provides End
to End Digital Process (Greenwich Associates).
Environmental, social and governance (ESG) and making
positive contributions to society are important for Bank
of America and, increasingly, for many of our clients. The
transition to a low-carbon economy means that a significant
flow of capital will have to be put to work in an efficient and
effective manner. Our clients will need advice and expertise,
and we continue to invest to build this capability. To this end,
within GCIB, we have established a new team, ESG Advisory
and Financing Solutions, to help our clients across industry
sectors determine how ESG impacts their cost of capital
and strategic initiatives and to assist them in navigating
through climate transition. This new team is well-positioned
to advise our clients, as Bank of America continues to be at
the forefront of ESG financing — in 2021, GCIB was the No. 1
underwriter of U.S. ESG corporate bonds.
As we look to the future, we will continue to work relentlessly
for our clients. We are committed to leveraging our resources
and franchise to deliver for them — and grow with them — as
a steadfast and trusted partner for the long term.

GLOBAL MARKETS

Diversified, balanced

and growing

Global Markets brings the power of our leading

global franchise to local clients around the

world by ofering sales, trading and research

services to institutional clients across fxed-

income, credit, currency, commodity and equity

businesses. Our product coverage includes

securities and derivative products in both the

primary and secondary markets.

Under the leadership of Jim DeMare, we provide market-
making, financing, securities-clearing, settlement and custody
services globally to approximately 8,000 institutional clients
in support of their investing and trading activities. We
also work with teammates across the company to provide
commercial and corporate clients with risk management
products using interest rate, equity, credit, currency and
commodity derivatives, foreign exchange, fixed-income and
mortgage-related products.

As a result of our market-making activities in these products,
we manage risk in a broad range of financial products,
including government securities, equity and equity-linked
securities, high-grade and high-yield corporate debt
securities, syndicated loans, mortgage-backed securities,
commodities and asset-backed securities.

A strong year delivering Responsible Growth
In 2021, we navigated the markets well and had the strongest
year of reported sales and trading revenue in the last decade.
We achieved positive momentum in many areas — from
financial performance to execution on strategic priorities.

Our client share increased, which helped the team improve
sales and trading revenue share among the top five U.S.
banks and provided a strong foundation for returns in the long
run through increased financial resources in line with Bank of
America’s strategic plan.

We also made progress in deepening relationships with
our largest clients and expanding business with mid-tier
and smaller clients. The team continues to grow the Global
Markets business across products and regions to better serve
clients as they grow, too.

The size and breadth of our markets and clients have
increased significantly over the past five years. Client needs
continue to evolve, driven by the dynamics of active, passive
and purpose-driven investing, such as ESG, coupled with the
forces of technology, regulation and profitability.
Our global client base values us for providing a diversified,
balanced business model that delivers both scale and breadth
of products as their capital markets and trading activities
increase. We do this by matching local presence with a class-
leading global platform of top-tier sales, trading and research;
strong and expanding capabilities in emerging areas like
sustainable finance and ESG; and the advantages of a data-
driven and technology-enabled business.
We continue to build our business and the value we deliver

superior execution capabilities that best serve their needs.

A global team that delivers locally

Our market presidents lead the way to deliver
our capabilities to clients in every community
and to support non-proft partners with
their important work. Local presidents bring
community knowledge and relationships to
help ensure our eight lines of business work
together for each client. Local leaders also
tap into Bank of America capabilities to
strengthen partnerships with local non-profts,
and create opportunities for our local
employees to champion our culture of diversity
and inclusion while taking advantage of the
many programs we ofer for teammates to
develop and grow.
Demonstrating the success of this strategy, our Greater
Washington, D.C. market, which includes 150 financial
centers and more than 2,400 teammates from all areas of
our company, delivered exceptional results for the Greater
Washington, D.C. clients and community in 2021.
“While so many know the D.C. region as a great place to visit,
we know it as home,” said Larry Di Rita, President of Bank
of America Greater Washington, D.C. “We understand the
economy and culture, the strengths and challenges. That
helps us deliver our global capabilities through local focus,
with better results for clients and for our company.”

At the end of 2021, Bank of America was the top retail deposit
holder in Greater Washington, D.C., with 10% year-over-year
growth. The lines of business in the market, working as
a single team, have had a number of other wins including:
- Global Corporate & Investment Banking (GCIB) was sole
bookrunner for a $100M+ frst follow-on equity ofering for a
D.C.-based public company, following an introduction from a
Private Bank team with an existing relationship with a board
member at the company.
- When a local publicly-traded client was seeking ways to
attract and retain talent, our Global Commercial Banking
(GCB) team partnered with Corporate Employee Banking &
Investments (CEBI) and Merrill to enhance the company’s
benefts. This led to an increase in employee satisfaction for
them and double-digit growth in new client households using
our products.
- The Private Bank worked with several GCB privately-held
business clients to provide pre-transaction planning and
advice in advance of the clients selling their businesses.
- A Merrill wealth management client needing a more robust
fnancial services platform developed a comprehensive, full

relationship with Business Banking , including deposit and
treasury management and lending.
“Our line of business teams deliver together for our clients
in Greater D.C. every day,” said D. Steve Boland, Chief
Administrative Officer and Greater Washington, D.C. market
sponsor. “All the while, we are addressing the community’s
greatest challenges through partnerships with local
organizations and leaders who deliver on a global scale.”
Guided by our Responsible Growth principle that success
must be shared to be sustainable, the Greater D.C. leadership
team invests across this diverse region. In 2021, we worked
with local partner Building Bridges Across the River for a
$1M grant to help construct the 11th Street Bridge Park ,
Washington’s first elevated public park, to be built on the
piers of the old 11th Street Bridge across the Anacostia River.
The new park will literally bridge the Anacostia neighborhood
to the bustling Washington Navy Yard area and spur economic
development east of the river. Our support will help provide
274 construction jobs and 38 full-time jobs, and create a
green space to better connect neighborhoods separated by
income, race and geography.
As part of the Anacostia-area project, our Greater D.C. team
also facilitated the building of a 76-unit mixed use affordable
housing development; invested in the Washington Area
Community Investment Fund (WACIF) to establish a small
business center for entrepreneurs of color; and enabled the
expansion of local non-profit Bread for the City’s health clinic
for preventative health care.
“Through our business offerings, our partnerships with
non-profit and community leaders, and the trust of our
neighbors, we are driving meaningful growth and helping
create opportunity and prosperity in Greater Washington,
D.C.,” said Larry.
This approach to local delivery is repeated in each of our
93 markets across the United States every day, helping us
deliver Responsible Growth, improve the financial lives of our
customers and clients, and strengthen our communities.

National Community Advisory Council

provides valuable perspective

To better understand and responsibly address the needs of
our clients and communities, we seek outside perspective.
In 2005, we formed our National Community Advisory
Council (NCAC), which has evolved to provide guidance
on a range of issues affecting our clients, employees
and communities. NCAC is comprised of senior leaders
from social justice, consumer advocacy, community
development, environmental and research organizations
who offer critical feedback, engage us in healthy debate
and deliver well-informed advice on our business practices
and products, community investments, diversity and
inclusion efforts and more.
NCAC members’ depth of knowledge on the needs of
lower income individuals contributed to our developing
solutions and resources to help our clients manage their
finances responsibly, including SafeBalance Banking,
Affordable Loan Solution™, Better Money Habits, Balance
Assist and the sweeping changes to our overdraft policies
announced in early January 2022.
“This comprehensive program by Bank of America,
including eliminating and reducing fees, continuing its
low-cost Balance Assist loan program and providing early
access to deposits, provides the tools for its customers to
succeed financially. It sets a gold standard for overdraft
reform, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
should promptly adopt rules that provide these protections
to all bank customers.” — Mike Calhoun , President, Center
for Responsible Lending

The NCAC meets at least twice annually, and has been
meeting with greater frequency during the pandemic.
Our CEO and senior management team join these
meetings regularly, and our independent Board of
Directors members have had the opportunity to meet
and hear directly from our NCAC advisors. These leaders
are important and valuable voices helping us deliver
Responsible Growth.

Investing in diverse entrepreneurs

In 2021, we built on our long-standing efforts to help create
opportunities for people and communities of color, including
supporting homeownership, creating career opportunities,
initiating our second $2 billion Equality Progress Sustainability
Bond and running our 30-year-old formal Supplier Diversity &
Responsible Sourcing Program.

In addition, we have committed $1.25 billion over five years
to advance racial equality and economic opportunity. As part
of that effort, we’ve dedicated $350 million to minority- and
women-led companies through capital investment by mission-
focused venture funds, with more than $300 million of that
funding committed to 100+ minority-focused and minority-led
equity funds in just over a year.

These investments further our work to support
entrepreneurship and the growth of small businesses, helping
to diminish or eliminate the barriers that make it difficult
for people of color to access start-up and growth capital.
Addressing this gap requires significant, systematic change.

We proactively sought out and invested in minority-focused
and minority-led equity funds that provide capital to under-
represented minority and women entrepreneurs and small
business owners. These funds help owners establish and grow
their businesses, create jobs and improve financial stability
in local communities across the country. We expect our
growing portfolio of funds to invest in 2,000+ minority- and
women-led companies over the next five years.

Of the funds we have currently in our portfolio:

**- 67% are led by Black/African American managers

24% are led by Hispanic-Latino managers
57% are led by women**
Research suggests that funds led by diverse leaders generate
returns that are significantly higher than the overall average
of the venture capital industry. By focusing on both the
amount of capital we’re committing and the quality and
sustainability of the partnerships we’re creating, our portfolio
of funds is designed to be profitable over the investment
cycle. Those profits will be invested in new and follow-on
funds raised by our existing partners, driving Responsible
Growth. We intend for our investment to be a force multiplier,
encouraging our peer institutions to deepen their own
investments in these under-capitalized funds.

“For a frst-time fund, having institutional
support from BofA was critical to the
momentum of our fundraising process.
Early into our partnership, We are
already leveraging Bank of America’s
full enterprise to deliver value for our
entrepreneurs and LPs.”
Maria Velissaris
Founder, SteelSky Ventures | Atlanta, GA
“Our partnership with Bank of America
showcases the company’s support of our
mission to create a more equitable future
for women of color entrepreneurs. The
diverse team of bankers who are dedicated
to our Fund make themselves available
for getting our founders access to the
resources they need to obtain success.”

Driving progress toward environmental and

social sustainability

As a global financial services organization, we have set
tangible sustainable finance goals and made measurable
progress in mobilizing and scaling capital deployment
to help drive social and environmental change. By unlocking
the power of the private sector and partnering with the
public sector effectively, we are addressing financing gaps
where government or philanthropic funding falls short. Our
sustainable finance strategy permeates what we do — for
our clients, employees and in our communities — to promote
an inclusive, lower carbon, enduring society for all.

We have taken a leading role in several forums focused on
increasing global capital flows into sustainable projects and
entities that address the U.N. Sustainable Development
Goals. Our CEO Brian Moynihan chairs the World Economic
Forum’s International Business Council and has been working
with global corporate executives and accounting firms to
define and democratize various environmental, social and
governance metrics that companies can report, regardless of

also serves as co-chair of His Royal Highness The Prince

Vatican, under the guidance of His Holiness Pope Francis.
Additionally, Bank of America contributed to the founding of
the Rocky Mountain Institute for Climate Aligned Finance and
the Net-Zero Banking Alliance within the Glasgow Financial
Alliance for Net Zero. We are one of the founding members of
the U.N. Global Investors for Sustainable Development Alliance
and a Steering Committee member of the World Economic
Forum’s Financing the Transition to a Net-Zero Future.
Sustainability guides how we conduct our business and
operations as well as how we pursue Responsible Growth
across core lending and investments, equity and debt capital
markets activities, advisory services, supply chain financing
and management, daily operations and engagement with
internal teammates. As we consider our role in supporting a
smooth transition, we continue to partner with global clients
on clean energy and power generation and transmission,
sustainable transportation with the emphasis on electric
vehicles and sustainable fuels, sustainable food and
agriculture, clean water and sanitation, and carbon capture
and offsetting solutions, as well as more capital deployment
in affordable housing, healthcare, education, and minority-
and women-led businesses and underserved communities.

Making Bank of America a

great place for us all to work

In 2021, we continued to invest in our

teammates as part of being a great place for

us all to work. Helping teammates thrive during

a year of change included ofering programs to

support them and their families through life’s

important moments, creating opportunities

to help them grow and develop in their careers

and being a diverse and inclusive workplace.

Our focus for much of the past two years has been on
prioritizing our teammates’ health and safety as the health
crisis continues to evolve. We relied on strong partnerships
with health experts, local health networks and other
resources to inform decisions we made as a company and to
provide appropriate guidance and resources to our employees.
Additionally, we continued to address racial, social and
economic issues facing our communities, many accelerated
by the health crisis, both internally and externally. We created
opportunities for employees to connect with and support
each other, and advanced our long-term investments through
community partnerships and grants to support education
and job-skill programming as part of our $1.25 billion,
five-year commitment to advance racial equality and
economic opportunity.

We continued to evaluate and expand our benefits and
programs already in place. We have built a strong and

diverse talent pipeline through our campus recruiting
programs — including one of our most diverse classes ever
in 2021— and through community partnerships. These
partnerships are helping our company attract future leaders
and advance racial equality and economic opportunity in the
communities where we live and work. And we’re seeing the
progress from these combined efforts, including increases in
our diverse representation of women and people of color.
We will continue to report on these items and the progress
we’re making as part of our ongoing commitment to being a
great place to work for all teammates.
“Achieving Responsible Growth means we
want to attract, develop and retain the
best people, and to do that, we work hard
to ofer an inclusive workplace, career
growth and development, and rewarding
and comprehensive benefts that will help
our employees thrive at every stage of
their careers and their lives — that has never
been more important.”

Protecting employees and their families

during the global health crisis

The health and safety of our employees is our top priority. In
2021, as the world faced a second year with the coronavirus,
we helped safeguard and support our employees and their
loved ones.

Supporting our teammates’ health and safety
Throughout 2021, we supported our employees as they
adapted to the developing global health crisis. We expanded
our health and wellness programs, increased benefits for
child and adult care, provided flexible time off and offered
free COVID-19 testing as well as vaccine clinics in some of
our workspaces.

To help teammates stay healthy, we offered 24/7 access to
no-cost virtual general medicine and behavioral health resources
for eligible employees, and invited health experts to share
their latest insights into the evolving situation through video
discussions and ongoing guidance and tips for preventing illness.
We also offered support and resources to those diagnosed with
or recovering from coronavirus, and our Life Event Services
(LES) and Medical Benefits Escalations teams responded to
employees facing challenges related to the pandemic.

Returning to the office safely
We continue to evolve our benefits, programs and support
for teammates working in our U.S. financial centers, call
centers and operation centers. This has included special
compensation incentives, reimbursement for alternative

forms of transportation and other tailored support, such as
meals and meal subsidies in select U.S. locations.
To drive vaccine awareness and make it easy for employees
choosing to be vaccinated, we offered paid time off to
receive the shots. As vaccination rates increased and it was
determined safe to do so, we began returning teammates to
the office who had shared they were vaccinated through our
secure online tool, with 30 days’ advance notice.
As employees returned to the office, we put health and safety
protocols in place, including conducting enhanced cleanings,
offering onsite testing, providing health supplies (such as
face coverings, gloves and hand sanitizer) and following other
protocols recommended by health officials. By the end of 2021,
more than 100,000 employees were working in the office and
nearly all of our offices were open.
In 2022, we continue to monitor and react to the changing
environment so we can help our teammates stay healthy
and safe as the fight against the coronavirus evolves. We
are hosting on-site COVID-19 vaccination and booster clinics
and are reinforcing that receiving a booster is critical to
protecting our employees and community. Earlier this year,
we committed to donating $100 for each U.S. employee who
registers that they received a booster, and have committed
$10.6 million to help fight hunger in our local communities.

Promoting physical, emotional and

financial wellness

We deepened our already-enhanced focus on the wellbeing of our employees and their loved

ones in 2021, and provided comprehensive benefts and programs to support their overall wellness

and help them thrive.

Physical wellness

In addition to the work we’re doing to support our employees
and their families during the global health crisis, our approach
to physical wellness is based on how we can help employees
address health risks and manage health care costs, including
by providing robust health and insurance benefits as well as
wellness and prevention resources.

For the ninth year in a row, we held medical premiums
flat for U.S. employees earning less than $50,000 in
performance year cash compensation. And, for the fifth
straight year, employees earning between $50,000 and less
than $100,000 saw nominal premium increases.

We enhanced benefits for employees and their families ,
including approximately 60,000 free virtual consults with
physicians and behavioral health specialists.

We introduced a new cancer support benefit for
employees and loved ones to help schedule expedited
appointments, coordinate care, recommend a local facility
and more.

We provided no-cost virtual medical consultations with
Teladoc® and a 24/7 nurse line for those enrolled in our
national U.S. bank medical plans.

Our popular Get Active! employee fitness challenge
helped to encourage teammates to engage in physical activity
during the health crisis. Together, our teammates took more
than 5.3 billion steps and learned more about the importance
of physical activity, nutrition, stress reduction and sleep.
Emotional wellness
Mental health has been an increasingly urgent and important
focus as the global health crisis continues, and we’ve provided
additional resources to help employees manage stress, build
resiliency and pursue mindfulness.
We added access to licensed social workers and
psychologists for youths aged 13-17 through Teladoc in
addition to the no-cost virtual consultations with mental
health specialists for employees in our national medical plans.
Over 23,000 telephonic and face-to-face confidential
counseling sessions were supported through our Employee
Assistance Program (EAP), and we began offering on-site
EAP counselors to support employees at some of our office
locations.
40 | BANK OF AMERICA 2021

Our Life Event Services (LES) team provides teammates
with personalized connections to resources when they need
them the most by tapping experts inside and outside the
company for assistance with significant events like domestic
violence, natural disasters, terminal illness, survivor support
and more.

We continued to provide additional resources from
Thrive Global, including digital programs and access to our
new training resource, Thriving Families modules, to assist
with navigating new home and work routines.

All employees globally have access at no cost to
mindfulness apps, company-led mindfulness training
and daily mindfulness practices to keep a focus on mental
health throughout the year.

We provide 26 weeks of parental leave for the birth
or adoption of a child, 16 weeks of which are fully paid for
eligible teammates.

Our Family Planning Reimbursement program provides
teammates with the flexibility to choose reimbursement

for eligible adoption, fertility and/or surrogacy expenses, up
to a collective $20,000 lifetime maximum over the course
of their career at the company, and our Family Support
program (through our company’s national health plans) offers
additional support for new or future parents.
To help employees when child or adult care plans fall
through, we increased our back-up care program to
offer 50 days of back-up care for both adults and children
(up from 40 days).
Understanding that time off is important for emotional
wellness, we added more flexibility with vacation and
paid personal/illness days for U.S. teammates, including:
The option to carry over up to fve days of accrued-but-unused
vacation to the frst quarter of the following year, every year
Adding Juneteenth as a bank holiday, and allowing U.S.
employees to now use up to fve occasional illness days as
personal days every year to take care of personal needs or
to celebrate important cultural or religious holidays
Providing employees time of to get vaccinated for COVID-19

Financial wellness

Our company’s purpose is to help make financial lives better
through the power of every connection. So, it’s especially
important that we support the financial wellness of our
employees. That includes offering benefits and programs to
help employees reach their short- and long-term financial
goals, plan for the future and manage life’s priorities.

In 2021, we introduced several enhancements to our
Child Care Plus® reimbursement program to increase the
number of teammates eligible for this benefit. We increased
the reimbursement to $275 per month, per eligible child
to offer more assistance with childcare costs when employees
need to be at work.

We offer education benefits to teammates and their
children to support their goals, from going back to school
or pursuing job-related courses, degrees or approved
professional certification exams to looking for guidance as
their children prepare for college.

In 2021, we provided $22 million in tuition assistance —
a 40% increase over 2020—for approximately 5,000
teammates. Employees are eligible to receive up to $7,500 per
year to help with academic degrees or certifications.

We also offer free, one-on-one expert college
admissions coaching for teammates and their children in
school grades 8–12 to help plan for and navigate the college
admissions and financial aid process.

We automatically enroll teammates into the 401(k)
plan to help with saving for retirement. Based on service for
eligible U.S. teammates, we make an annual contribution
of 2%–3% regardless of employee 401(k) contribution level.
We also offer matching contributions of up to 5% of eligible
pay on a dollar-for-dollar basis.

Note: Specific programs vary by region. U.S. programs shown.

42 | BANK OF AMERICA 2021

We offer an Employee Relief Fund, which provides
employees up to $2,500 in relief per event for a qualified
disaster and up to $5,000 for an unexpected emergency
hardship. Employees can receive up to $10,000 in total grants
in a rolling 12-month period. Since the beginning of the health
crisis in 2020, we have provided a total of $13 million to
teammates from the fund.
We continue to offer benefits and programs to help
teammates focus on their financial health:
Experienced independent fnancial counselors are available
through our Benefts Education & Planning Center
for teammates to receive free, personalized, confdential
guidance to help them get the most out of their employee
benefts and investment education to help them achieve their
fnancial goals.
The Financial Wellness Tracker available through Benefts
OnLine® helps teammates assess where they are fnancially
and connects them with personalized suggestions and
company resources to improve their fnancial health.
- Better Money Habits is a free education resource
helping people improve their fnancial wellness through our
partnership with Khan Academy.
Recognizing and rewarding

teammate performance

Our pay-for-performance compensation approach
strives to recognize and reward performance
with competitive and fair pay for the work done, at
all levels of our company.

We have long been a leader in establishing a
minimum rate of U.S. pay. In May, we built on
this history when we announced an increase in our
minimum hourly wage for U.S. employees to $25 by

We took a step closer to our goal by increasing
our minimum pay to $21 in October 2021, soon
after we raised this same wage to $20 per hour in
March 2020.
In addition, in January 2022, we announced we
are once again providing our teammates Sharing
Success compensation awards in appreciation for
their extraordinary efforts over the past year. The total
value of the awards provided to employees increased
to $1 billion this year. This is the fifth time this award
has been given since 2017, totaling nearly $3.3 billion.

Approximately 97% of our employees received
an award this year. Most awards are in the form of
Bank of America stock, providing the opportunity to

further share in our company’s long-term success.
These awards are in addition to our standard annual
compensation and bonus awards.
We also maintain robust policies and practices
that reinforce equal pay for equal work , including
reviews with oversight from our Board and senior
leaders.
For over 15 years, we have conducted rigorous
processes and analyses with outside experts to
examine individual employee pay before year-end
compensation decisions are finalized, and we adjust
compensation where appropriate.
Results of this equal pay for equal work review
showed that compensation received by women was on
average more than 99% of that received by men, and
that compensation received by people of color in the
U.S. was on average more than 99% of that received
by non-people of color employees.

Our ongoing work to foster a
diverse workforce and inclusive culture
We understand the role we play in influencing and driving
progress around diversity, inclusion, racial equality and
economic opportunity in financial services, the private sector
and the communities where we live and work.
That’s why we continue taking meaningful steps to drive
diverse representation at all levels of the company and are
building a culture where our employees feel comfortable being
who they are and bringing their whole selves to work with
equal access to opportunities regardless of their differences.
It’s the right thing to do, and we think it’s good for business.
Our commitment starts at the top
Creating an inclusive environment starts at the top. Our
Board of Directors, its committees and our CEO play a key
role in the oversight of our culture, expecting management
to be accountable for ethical and professional conduct and
our commitment to being a great place to work. Our CEO and
management team set the diversity and inclusion goals of
the company. Each management team member has action-
oriented diversity goals, which are subject to our quarterly
business review process, talent planning and scorecards
reviewed by the Board. Management team members cascade
goals to support commitment and accountability across the
company, and drive an inclusive work environment.
The Global Diversity & Inclusion Council (GDIC) promotes
diversity goal setting, which is embedded in our performance
management process and occurs at all levels of the
organization. The GDIC consists of senior executives from
every line of business, has been in place for over 20 years and
has been chaired by our CEO since 2007. The Council sponsors
and supports business, operating unit and regional diversity
and inclusion councils to help align to enterprise diversity
strategies and goals.
Our management team now includes individuals with
an average of 21 years of service with the company and
31 years in financial services, with increased global and
international expertise and the most diversity in our history.
The management team is now 55% diverse, including
seven women, two Black/African American, two Asian
and one Hispanic-Latino leaders. At the end of 2021, our
company remained one of only nine S&P 100 companies
with six or more women on the Board.
We continue to exceed industry benchmarks for
our diverse workforce and inclusive culture
Our workforce is 50% women and 49% people of color,
reflecting the clients and communities we serve. We
have worked hard to narrow the gaps at our leadership
levels across the company. We hold ourselves accountable
for increasing diverse representation by disclosing our
employment metrics, measuring progress across top
management levels, helping ensure managers are responsible
for driving advancement on their teams, and building a
robust pipeline of emerging talent through recruitment and

Employee engagement survey and

turnover results

We have conducted an annual Employee Engagement
Survey for nearly two decades. In 2021, 89% of teammates
(nearly 182,000 teammates) participated, demonstrating our
employees’ willingness to give us feedback on how we are
meeting their needs.

Since 2012, our Employee Engagement Index score has
continued to trend upward, even during the global health
crisis. Through our enterprise engagement survey, we also
measure an internal Diversity & Inclusion Index¹ that gives
us feedback on how we measure inclusion at the bank.
Our D&I Index has a positive trend over time and exceeds
industry benchmarks.

The results of the survey and the process of continuous
improvement that ensues is discussed with the Board at least
annually. Our efforts reflect our progress in being a great
place to work.

We believe our employee turnover reflects the strength of our
employee engagement results and how our teammates view
the Bank as an employer of choice. Over the past decade,

our turnover rate has decreased and has been among the

companies, our turnover did increase in 2021 as labor markets
normalized. Even with that increase in 2021, we are seeing
employee turnover at a similar rate as pre-pandemic record
low levels of 11–12% turnover, a strong result for a company

STAKEHOLDER CAPITALISM METRICS

This index includes our disclosures using the Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics developed by the International Business Council (IBC)
of the World Economic Forum, as well as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the United Nations Global
Compact (UNGC) reporting frameworks. We believe this disclosure helps to demonstrate how our sustainable business model
drives progress towards inclusive capitalism and the U.N.’s Sustainable Development Goals. In this index, we either reference
existing disclosures or respond directly. We evaluate and select the metrics we believe are most relevant to our business model
and we expect our disclosures to evolve over time. All reported data is as of or for year-end December 31, 2021, unless otherwise
noted. See page 62 for Cautionary Information and Forward-Looking Statements regarding Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics.
INDICATES CORE METRIC
Principles of Governance

THEME METRIC/QUESTION RESPONSE/FRAMEWORK ALIGNMENT

Governing Purpose Setting Purpose: The company’s stated purpose, as the
expression of the means by which a business proposes
solutions to economic, environmental, and social issues.
Corporate purpose should create value for all stakeholders,
including shareholders.

How we operate to drive Responsible Growth, as articulated in
this 2021 Annual Report, and our 2022 Proxy Statement details
how our environmental, social, and governance leadership create
stakeholder value.
IBC
Purpose-led management: How the company’s stated purpose
is embedded in company strategies, policies, and goals.
Description of proxy voting and investee engagement policies Merrill Lynch and Merrill Private Wealth Management clients enrolled
and procedures in our investment advisory programs directly determine how to
vote their proxies. Through our investment advisory agreement,
clients may delegate proxy voting authority directly to institutional
shareholder services (ISS) or elect to vote proxies themselves. As part
of delegating to ISS, clients may, at their discretion, choose among the
ISS Benchmark, ISS Socially Responsible Investing, and ISS Catholic
proxy voting guidelines. Managed Account Advisors (MAA) and Merrill
Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith (MLPF&S) perform due diligence on ISS
to determine that it has the capacity and competency to adequately
analyze proxy issues and can make such voting recommendations in
an impartial manner and in the best interests of clients. For matters
over which ISS has a confict or is otherwise unable to vote (called
Specifed investments), the proxy committee of MAA or MLPF&S,
as applicable, will have the authority to vote proxies in accordance
with its proxy voting policies and procedures. MAA or MLPF&S does
not assume proxy voting authority for securities except with respect
to Specifed Investments. For proxies neither covered by ISS nor
included as Specifed Investments, the client will retain the right to
vote those proxies. Generally, Bank of America Private Bank clients
delegate authority to the Private Bank to vote proxies on their behalf.
The Private Bank has a fduciary-focused proxy voting policy and

is distinct from such terms as defined for SEC reporting
purposes. Any inclusion of ESG Information in this report in
response to a metric or question referencing materiality is
not an indication that the subject or information is material
to Bank of America for SEC reporting purposes. Additionally,
certain statements regarding Responsible Growth and ESG
Information are not guarantees or promises that such metrics,
goals or commitments will be met and are based on current
goals, commitments, estimates, assumptions, developing
standards and methodologies and currently available data,
which continue to evolve and develop. Such ESG Information

Bank of America 2021 65
banking and nonbank financial services and products through
four business segments: Consumer Banking, Global Wealth &
Investment Management (GWIM), Global Banking and Global
Markets, with the remaining operations recorded in All Other. We
operate our banking activities primarily under the Bank of
America, National Association (Bank of America, N.A. or BANA)
charter. At December 31, 2021, the Corporation had $3.2
trillion in assets and a headcount of approximately 208,000
employees.

Recent Developments

Capital Management
On February 2, 2022, the Corporation announced that the Board
of Directors declared a quarterly cash common stock dividend of
$0.21 per share, payable on March 25, 2022 to shareholders
of record as of March 4, 2022.
For more information on our capital resources and regulatory
developments, see Capital Management on page 88.

COVID-19 Pandemic

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic (the
pandemic) has impacted the Corporation and may continue to
do so, as uncertainty remains about the duration of the
pandemic and the timing and strength of the global economic
recovery. As the pandemic continues to evolve, we regularly
evaluate protocols and processes in place to execute our
business continuity plans. In conjunction with our efforts to
support clients affected by the pandemic, we have cumulatively
originated $35.4 billion in loans under the Paycheck Protection
Program (PPP) with amounts outstanding of $4.7 billion and
$22.7 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020. For more
information on PPP loans, see Note 1 3 Summary of Significant
Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The future direct and indirect impact of the pandemic on our
businesses, results of operations and financial condition
remains uncertain. Should current economic conditions
deteriorate or if the pandemic worsens due to various factors,

including through the spread of more easily communicable
variants of COVID-19, such conditions could have an adverse
effect on our businesses and results of operations and could
adversely affect our financial condition.
For more information on how the risks related to the
pandemic adversely affect our businesses, results of operations
and financial condition, see Part 1. Item 1A. Risk Factors of our
2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rates
Subject to the continued publication of certain non-
representative London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)
benchmark settings based on a modified calculation (i.e., on a
<synthetic= basis), British Pound Sterling, Euro, Swiss Franc and
Japanese Yen LIBOR settings and one-week and two-month U.S.
dollar (USD) LIBOR settings ceased or became no longer
representative of the underlying market the rates seek to
measure (i.e., non-representative) immediately after
December 31, 2021, and the remaining USD LIBOR settings
(i.e., overnight, one month, three month, six month and 12
month) will cease or become non-representative immediately
after June 30, 2023. Separately, the Federal Reserve, the Office
of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) issued supervisory
guidance encouraging banks to cease entering into new
contracts that use USD LIBOR as a reference rate by
December 31, 2021 subject to certain regulatory-approved
exceptions (USD LIBOR Guidance).
As a result, a major transition has been and continues to be
in progress in the global financial markets with respect to the
replacement of Interbank Offered Rates (IBORs). This is a
complex process impacting a variety of our businesses and
operations. IBORs have historically been used in many of the
Corporation9s products and contracts, including derivatives,
consumer and commercial loans, mortgages, floating-rate notes
and other adjustable-rate products and financial instruments. In
response, the Corporation established an enterprise-wide IBOR
transition program, with active involvement of senior
management and regular reports to the Management Risk
Committee (MRC) and Enterprise Risk Committee (ERC). The
program continues to drive the Corporation's industry and
regulatory engagement, client and financial contract changes,
internal and external communications, technology and
operations modifications, including updates to its operational
models, systems and processes, introduction of new products,
migration of existing clients, and program strategy and
governance.
As of December 31, 2021, the Corporation has transitioned
or otherwise addressed IBOR-based products and contracts
referencing the rates that ceased or became non-representative
after December 31, 2021, including LIBOR-linked commercial
loans, LIBOR-based adjustable-rate consumer mortgages,
LIBOR-linked derivatives and interdealer trading of certain USD
LIBOR and other interest rate swaps, and related hedging
66 Bank of America 2021
arrangements. Additionally, in accordance with the USD LIBOR
Guidance, the Corporation has ceased entering into new
contracts that use USD LIBOR as a reference rate, subject to
certain regulatory-approved exceptions.
The Corporation launched capabilities and services to
support the issuance and trading in products indexed to various
alternative reference rates (ARRs) and developed employee
training programs as well as other internal and external sources
of information on the various challenges and opportunities that
the replacement of IBORs has presented and continues to
present. The Corporation continues to monitor a variety of
market scenarios as part of its transition efforts, including risks
associated with insufficient preparation by individual market
participants or the overall market ecosystem, ability of market
participants to meet regulatory and industry-wide recommended
milestones and access and demand by clients and market
participants to liquidity in certain products, including LIBOR
products.
With respect to the transition of LIBOR products referencing
USD LIBOR settings ceasing or becoming non-representative as
of June 30, 2023, a significant majority of the Corporation9s
notional contractual exposure to such LIBOR currencies, of
which the significant majority is derivatives contracts, have been
remediated (i.e., updated to include fallback provisions to ARRs
based on market driven protocols, regulatory guidance and
industry-recommended fallback provisions and related
mechanisms) and the Corporation is continuing to remediate the
remaining USD LIBOR exposure. The remaining exposure, a
majority of which is made up of derivatives and commercial
loans and which represents a small minority of outstanding USD
LIBOR notional contractual exposure of the Corporation, will
require active dialogue with clients to modify the contracts. For
any residual exposures after June 2023 that continue to have
no fallback provisions, the Corporation is assessing and
planning to leverage relevant contractual and statutory
solutions, including relevant state legislation and any future
federal legislation, to transition such exposure to ARRs.
The Corporation has implemented regulatory, tax and
accounting changes and continues to monitor current and
potential impacts of the transition, including Internal Revenue
Service tax regulations and guidance and Financial Accounting
Standards Board guidance. In addition, the Corporation has
engaged impacted clients in connection with the transition by
providing ARRs education and the timing of transition events.
The Corporation is also working actively with global regulators,
industry working groups and trade associations. For more
information on the expected replacement of LIBOR and other
benchmark rates, see Item 1A. Risk Factors of our 2021 Annual
Report on Form 10-K.

Changes to Overdraft Services
In January 2022, the Corporation announced changes to its
overdraft services for consumer and small business clients,
which include eliminating non-sufficient funds (NSF) fees
beginning in February 2022 and reducing overdraft fees from
$35 to $10 beginning in May 2022. Fees from overdraft
services were approximately $1 billion in 2021 and recorded in
Consumer Banking as service charges in the Consolidated
Statement of Income. Due to the policy changes, in 2022 the
Corporation expects a significant reduction in NSF and overdraft
fees.

Net income was $32.0 billion or $3.57 per diluted share in
2021 compared to $17.9 billion or $1.87 per diluted share in

The increase in net income was due to improvement in
the provision for credit losses and higher revenue, partially
offset by higher noninterest expense.

Net Interest Income
Net interest income decreased $426 million to $42.9 billion in
2021 compared to 2020. Net interest yield on a fully taxable-
equivalent (FTE) basis decreased 24 basis points (bps) to 1.66
percent for 2021. The decrease in net interest income was
primarily driven by lower interest rates and average loan
balances, partially offset by higher average balances of debt
securities. For more information on net interest yield and the

Noninterest income increased $4.0 billion to $46.2 billion in
2021 compared to 2020. The following highlights the significant
changes.

ï Card income increased $562 million primarily driven by
increased client activity and merchant services revenue.
ï Service charges increased $363 million primarily due to
higher treasury and credit service charges and increased
client activity.
ï Investment and brokerage services increased $2.1 billion
primarily driven by higher market valuations and assets
under management (AUM) flows, partially offset by declines
in AUM pricing.
ï Investment banking fees increased $1.7 billion primarily due
to higher advisory fees as well as higher debt and equity
issuance fees.
ï Market making and similar activities increased $336 million
primarily driven by strong sales and trading performance in
Equities, partially offset by a weaker performance in Fixed
Income, Currencies and Commodities (FICC), which benefited
from a more favorable market environment in 2020.
ï Other income decreased $1.1 billion primarily due to a $704
million gain on sales of certain mortgage loans in the prior
year, as well as higher partnership losses on tax credit
investments.

Provision for Credit Losses
The provision for credit losses improved $15.9 billion to a
benefit of $4.6 billion in 2021 compared to 2020. The benefit
was primarily due to improvements in the macroeconomic
outlook and credit quality. For more information on the provision
for credit losses, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 112.

higher compensation and benefits expense, higher costs
associated with processing transactional card claims related to
state unemployment benefits, a contribution to the Bank of
America Foundation and an impairment charge for real estate
rationalization.

Income tax expense was $2.0 billion for 2021 compared to
$1.1 billion in 2020, resulting in an effective tax rate of 5.9
percent compared to 5.8 percent.
The effective tax rates for 2021 and 2020 were driven by the
impact of our recurring tax preference benefits and positive
income tax adjustments from the impact of U.K. tax law
changes discussed below. Our recurring tax preference benefits
primarily consist of tax credits from environmental, social and
governance (ESG) investments in affordable housing and
renewable energy, aligning with our responsible growth strategy
to address global sustainability challenges. Absent these tax
credits, the impact of the U.K. tax law changes and other
discrete items, the effective tax rates would have been
approximately 25 percent and 26 percent for 2021 and 2020.
In June 2021, the U.K. enacted the 2021 Finance Act, which
included an increase in the U.K. corporation income tax rate to
25 percent from 19 percent. This change is effective April 1,
2023 and unfavorably affects income tax expense on future
U.K. earnings. In addition, in July 2020, the U.K. enacted a
repeal of the final two percent of scheduled decreases in the
U.K. corporation income tax rate. As a result, in 2021 and
2020, the Corporation recorded write-ups of U.K. net deferred
tax assets of approximately $2.0 billion and $700 million, with
corresponding positive income tax adjustments. These write-ups
were reversals of previously recorded write-downs of net
deferred tax assets for prior changes in the U.K. corporation
income tax rate.

Assets

At December 31, 2021, total assets were approximately $3.2
trillion, up $349.9 billion from December 31, 2020. The
increase in assets was primarily due to higher debt securities
that were primarily funded by deposit growth, an increase in
loans and leases and higher trading account assets, partially
offset by lower federal funds sold and securities borrowed or
purchased under agreements to resell and cash and cash
equivalents.

Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents decreased $32.2 billion primarily
driven by higher investments in debt securities.

Federal Funds Sold and Securities Borrowed or Purchased
Under Agreements to Resell
Federal funds transactions involve lending reserve balances on
a short-term basis. Securities borrowed or purchased under
agreements to resell are collateralized lending transactions
utilized to accommodate customer transactions, earn interest
rate spreads and obtain securities for settlement and for
collateral. Federal funds sold and securities borrowed or
purchased under agreements to resell decreased $53.3 billion
primarily due to the investment of excess cash into debt
securities.

Trading Account Assets
Trading account assets consist primarily of long positions in
equity and fixed-income securities including U.S. government
and agency securities, corporate securities and non-U.S.
sovereign debt. Trading account assets increased $48.2 billion
primarily due to an increase in inventory within Global Markets.

Debt Securities
Debt securities primarily include U.S. Treasury and agency
securities, mortgage-backed securities (MBS), principally agency
MBS, non-U.S. bonds, corporate bonds and municipal debt. We
use the debt securities portfolio primarily to manage interest
rate and liquidity risk and to leverage market conditions that
create economically attractive returns on these investments.
Debt securities increased $297.8 billion primarily driven by the
deployment of deposit inflows. For more information on debt

securities, see Note 4 3 Securities to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.
Loans and Leases
Loans and leases increased $51.3 billion primarily driven by
growth in commercial loans and higher securities-based lending
within consumer loans. For more information on the loan
portfolio, see Credit Risk Management on page 98.
Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses
The allowance for loan and lease losses decreased $6.4 billion
primarily due to improvements in the macroeconomic outlook
and credit quality. For more information, see Allowance for
Credit Losses on page 112.
All Other Assets
All other assets increased $31.8 billion primarily driven by
higher margin loans and loans held-for-sale (LHFS).
Liabilities
At December 31, 2021, total liabilities were approximately $2.9
trillion, up $352.7 billion from December 31, 2020, primarily
due to deposit growth.
Deposits
Deposits increased $269.0 billion primarily due to an increase
in retail and wholesale deposits.
Federal Funds Purchased and Securities Loaned or Sold
Under Agreements to Repurchase
Federal funds transactions involve borrowing reserve balances
on a short-term basis. Securities loaned or sold under
agreements to repurchase are collateralized borrowing
transactions utilized to accommodate customer transactions,
earn interest rate spreads and finance assets on the balance
sheet. Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold
under agreements to repurchase increased $22.0 billion
primarily driven by client activity within Global Markets.
Trading Account Liabilities
Trading account liabilities consist primarily of short positions in
equity and fixed-income securities including U.S. Treasury and
agency securities, corporate securities and non-U.S. sovereign
Bank of America 2021 69
debt. Trading account liabilities increased $29.4 billion primarily
due to higher levels of short positions within Global Markets.

Short-term Borrowings
Short-term borrowings provide an additional funding source and
primarily consist of Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) short-term
borrowings, notes payable and various other borrowings that
generally have maturities of one year or less. Short-term
borrowings increased $4.4 billion primarily due to an increase in
short-term commercial paper issuances to manage liquidity
needs. For more information on short-term borrowings, see Note
10 3 Securities Financing Agreements, Short-term Borrowings and
Restricted Cash to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Long-term Debt
Long-term debt increased $17.2 billion primarily due to debt
issuances, partially offset by maturities, redemptions and
valuation adjustments. For more information on long-term debt,
see Note 11 3 Long-term Debt to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Shareholders9 Equity

Shareholders9 equity decreased $2.9 billion primarily due to
returns of capital to shareholders through common stock
repurchases and common and preferred stock dividends,
market value decreases on derivatives and debt securities and
the redemption of preferred stock, partially offset by net income.

Cash Flows Overview
The Corporation9s operating assets and liabilities support our
global markets and lending activities. We believe that cash
flows from operations, available cash balances and our ability to
generate cash through short- and long-term debt are sufficient to
fund our operating liquidity needs. Our investing activities
primarily include the debt securities portfolio and loans and
leases. Our financing activities reflect cash flows primarily
related to customer deposits, securities financing agreements,
long-term debt and common and preferred stock. For more
information on liquidity, see Liquidity Risk on page 93.

Supplemental Financial Data

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

In this Form 10-K, we present certain non-GAAP financial
measures. Non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain items
or otherwise include components that differ from the most
directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with
GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures are provided as additional
useful information to assess our financial condition, results of
operations (including period-to-period operating performance) or
compliance with prospective regulatory requirements. These
non-GAAP financial measures are not intended as a substitute
for GAAP financial measures and may not be defined or
calculated the same way as non-GAAP financial measures used
by other companies.
We view net interest income and related ratios and analyses
on an FTE basis, which when presented on a consolidated basis
are non-GAAP financial measures. To derive the FTE basis, net
interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt income on an
equivalent before-tax basis with a corresponding increase in
income tax expense. For purposes of this calculation, we use
the federal statutory tax rate of 21 percent and a representative
state tax rate. Net interest yield, which measures the basis
points we earn over the cost of funds, utilizes net interest
income on an FTE basis. We believe that presentation of these
items on an FTE basis allows for comparison of amounts from

both taxable and tax-exempt sources and is consistent with
industry practices.
We may present certain key performance indicators and
ratios excluding certain items (e.g., debit valuation adjustment
(DVA) gains (losses)) which result in non-GAAP financial
measures. We believe that the presentation of measures that
exclude these items is useful because such measures provide
additional information to assess the underlying operational
performance and trends of our businesses and to allow better
comparison of period-to-period operating performance.
We also evaluate our business based on certain ratios that
utilize tangible equity, a non-GAAP financial measure. Tangible
equity represents shareholders9 equity or common
shareholders9 equity reduced by goodwill and intangible assets
(excluding mortgage servicing rights (MSRs)), net of related
deferred tax liabilities (<adjusted= shareholders9 equity or
common shareholders9 equity). These measures are used to
evaluate our use of equity. In addition, profitability, relationship
and investment models use both return on average tangible
common shareholders9 equity and return on average tangible
shareholders9 equity as key measures to support our overall
growth objectives. These ratios are as follows:
ï Return on average tangible common shareholders9 equity
measures our net income applicable to common
shareholders as a percentage of adjusted average common
shareholders9 equity. The tangible common equity ratio
represents adjusted ending common shareholders9 equity
divided by total tangible assets.
ï Return on average tangible shareholders9 equity measures
our net income as a percentage of adjusted average total
shareholders9 equity. The tangible equity ratio represents
adjusted ending shareholders9 equity divided by total
tangible assets.
ï Tangible book value per common share represents adjusted
ending common shareholders9 equity divided by ending
common shares outstanding.
We believe ratios utilizing tangible equity provide additional
useful information because they present measures of those
assets that can generate income. Tangible book value per
common share provides additional useful information about the
level of tangible assets in relation to outstanding shares of
common stock.
The aforementioned supplemental data and performance
measures are presented in Tables 6 and 7.
For more information on the reconciliation of these non-GAAP
financial measures to the corresponding GAAP financial
measures, see Non-GAAP Reconciliations on page 124.
Key Performance Indicators
We present certain key financial and nonfinancial performance
indicators (key performance indicators) that management uses
when assessing our consolidated and/or segment results. We
believe they are useful to investors because they provide
additional information about our underlying operational
performance and trends. These key performance indicators
(KPIs) may not be defined or calculated in the same way as
similar KPIs used by other companies. For information on how
these metrics are defined, see Key Metrics on page 208.
Our consolidated key performance indicators, which include
various equity and credit metrics, are presented in Table 1 on
page 67, Table 6 on page 71 and Table 7 on page 72.
For information on key segment performance metrics, see
Business Segment Operations on page 75.

Business Segment Operations

Segment Description and Basis of Presentation

We report our results of operations through the following four business segments: Consumer Banking, GWIM, Global Banking and
Global Markets, with the remaining operations recorded in All Other. We manage our segments and report their results on an FTE
basis. The primary activities, products and businesses of the business segments and All Other are shown below.

We periodically review capital allocated to our businesses
and allocate capital annually during the strategic and capital
planning processes. We utilize a methodology that considers the
effect of regulatory capital requirements in addition to internal
risk-based capital models. Our internal risk-based capital
models use a risk-adjusted methodology incorporating each
segment9s credit, market, interest rate, business and
operational risk components. For more information on the
nature of these risks, see Managing Risk on page 85. The
capital allocated to the business segments is referred to as
allocated capital. Allocated equity in the reporting units is
comprised of allocated capital plus capital for the portion of
goodwill and intangibles specifically assigned to the reporting
unit. For more information, including the definition of a reporting
unit, see Note 7 3 Goodwill and Intangible Assets to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.
For information on our presentation of financial information
on an FTE basis, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 70,

and for reconciliations to consolidated total revenue, net income
and year-end total assets, see Note 23 3 Business Segment
Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Effective October 1, 2021, a business activity previously
included in Global Markets is being reported as a liquidating
business in All Other, consistent with a realignment in
performance reporting to senior management. The activity was
not material to Global Markets9 results of operations and
historical results have not been restated. For more information,
see Note 23 3 Business Segment Information to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.
Key Performance Indicators
We present certain key financial and nonfinancial performance
indicators that management uses when evaluating segment
results. We believe they are useful to investors because they
provide additional information about our segments9 operational
performance, customer trends and business growth.

(1) (^) Estimated at the segment level only.
(2) (^) In segments and businesses where the total of liabilities and equity exceeds assets, we allocate assets from All Other to match the segments9 and businesses9 liabilities and allocated
shareholders9 equity. As a result, total earning assets and total assets of the businesses may not equal total Consumer Banking.
Consumer Banking, comprised of Deposits and Consumer
Lending, offers a diversified range of credit, banking and
investment products and services to consumers and small
businesses. Deposits and Consumer Lending include the net
impact of migrating customers and their related deposit,
brokerage asset and loan balances between Deposits,
Consumer Lending and GWIM, as well as other client-managed
businesses. Our customers and clients have access to a coast-
to-coast network including financial centers in 38 states and the
District of Columbia. As of December 31, 2021, our network
includes approximately 4,200 financial centers, approximately
16,000 ATMs, nationwide call centers and leading digital
banking platforms with more than 41 million active users,
including approximately 33 million active mobile users.
Consumer Banking Results
Net income for Consumer Banking increased $5.4 billion to
$11.9 billion primarily due to improvement in the provision for
credit losses and higher revenue, partially offset by higher
noninterest expense. Net interest income increased $231
million to $24.9 billion primarily due to the benefit of higher
deposit balances and the acceleration of net capitalized loan
fees due to PPP loan forgiveness, partially offset by lower
interest rates and loan balances. Noninterest income increased
$512 million to $9.1 billion primarily driven by higher card
income and service charges due to increased client activity,
partially offset by the allocation of asset and liability
management (ALM) results.
The provision for credit losses improved $6.8 billion to a
benefit of $1.0 billion primarily driven by reserve releases due to
improvements in the macroeconomic outlook and credit quality.
Noninterest expense increased $408 million to $19.3 billion
primarily driven by an impairment charge for real estate
rationalization, the contribution to the Bank of America
Foundation, cost of increased client activity and continued
investments for business growth, including the merchant
services platform, partially offset by lower COVID-19 related
costs.
The return on average allocated capital was 31 percent, up
from 17 percent, driven by higher net income. For more
information on capital allocated to the business segments, see
Business Segment Operations on page 75.
76 Bank of America 2021

Deposits
Deposits includes the results of consumer deposit activities
that consist of a comprehensive range of products provided to
consumers and small businesses. Our deposit products include
noninterest- and interest-bearing checking accounts, money
market savings accounts, traditional savings accounts, CDs and
IRAs, as well as investment accounts and products. Net interest
income is allocated to the deposit products using our funds
transfer pricing process that matches assets and liabilities with
similar interest rate sensitivity and maturity characteristics.
Deposits generates fees such as account service fees, non-
sufficient funds fees, overdraft charges and ATM fees, as well
as investment and brokerage fees from Consumer Investment
accounts. Consumer Investments serves investment client
relationships through the Merrill Edge integrated investing and
banking service platform, providing investment advice and
guidance, client brokerage asset services, self-directed online
investing and key banking capabilities including access to the
Corporation9s network of financial centers and ATMs.
Net income for Deposits increased $483 million to $4.7
billion due to higher revenue and lower provision for credit
losses, partially offset by higher noninterest expense. Net
interest income increased $619 million to $14.4 billion primarily
due to the benefit of higher deposit balances. Noninterest
income increased $24 million to $3.7 billion primarily driven by
higher service charges and investment and brokerage fees,
largely offset by the allocation of ALM results.
The provision for credit losses decreased $139 million to
$240 million due to an improved macroeconomic outlook.
Noninterest expense increased $142 million to $11.7 billion
primarily driven by an impairment charge for real estate
rationalization, and the cost of increased client activity and
continued investments for business growth, partially offset by
lower COVID-19 related costs.
Average deposits increased $159.1 billion to $976.1 billion
primarily due to net inflows of $90.4 billion in checking and time
deposits and $68.0 billion in traditional savings and money
market savings driven by strong organic growth and government
stimulus measures.

The table below provides key performance indicators for
Deposits. Management uses these metrics, and we believe they
are useful to investors because they provide additional
information to evaluate our deposit profitability and digital/
mobile trends.

Consumer Lending
Consumer Lending offers products to consumers and small
businesses across the U.S. The products offered include debit
and credit cards, residential mortgages and home equity loans,
and direct and indirect loans such as automotive, recreational
vehicle and consumer personal loans. In addition to earning net
interest spread revenue on its lending activities, Consumer
Lending generates interchange revenue from debit and credit
card transactions, late fees, cash advance fees, annual credit
card fees, mortgage banking fee income and other
miscellaneous fees. Consumer Lending products are available
to our customers through our retail network, direct telephone,
and online and mobile channels. Consumer Lending results also
include the impact of servicing residential mortgages and home
equity loans, including loans held on the balance sheet of
Consumer Lending and loans serviced for others.
Bank of America 2021 77

Net income for Consumer Lending was $7.2 billion, an
increase of $4.9 billion, primarily due to improvement in the
provision for credit losses. Net interest income declined $388
million to $10.6 billion primarily due to lower interest rates and
loan balances. Noninterest income increased $488 million to
$5.3 billion primarily driven by higher card income due to
increased client activity.
The provision for credit losses improved $6.7 billion to a
benefit of $1.3 billion primarily driven by reserve releases due to
improvements in the macroeconomic outlook and credit quality.
Noninterest expense increased $266 million to $7.6 billion
primarily driven by continued investments for business growth,
partially offset by lower COVID-19 related costs.
Average loans decreased $30.8 billion to $279.6 billion
primarily driven by a decline in residential mortgage and credit
card loans.
The table below provides key performance indicators for
Consumer Lending. Management uses these metrics, and we
believe they are useful to investors because they provide
additional information about loan growth and profitability.

purchase volumes increased $60.0 billion to $311.6 billion as
spending continued to recover, with improvements across all
categories. Debit card purchase volumes increased $89.3
billion to $473.8 billion due to continued retail growth from the

GWIM consists of two primary businesses: Merrill Wealth
Management (MWM) and Bank of America Private Bank.
MWM's advisory business provides a high-touch client
experience through a network of financial advisors focused on
clients with over $250,000 in total investable assets. MWM
provides tailored solutions to meet clients' needs through a full
set of investment management, brokerage, banking and
retirement products.
Bank of America Private Bank, together with MWM's Private
Wealth Management business, provides comprehensive wealth
management solutions targeted to high net worth and ultra high
net worth clients, as well as customized solutions to meet
clients' wealth structuring, investment management, trust and
banking needs, including specialty asset management services.
Net income for GWIM increased $1.3 billion to $4.3 billion
driven by higher revenue and improvement in the provision for
credit losses, partially offset by higher noninterest expense. The
operating margin was 28 percent compared to 22 percent a year
ago.
Net interest income increased $196 million to $5.7 billion
due to the benefits of loan and deposit growth, partially offset
by lower interest rates.
Noninterest income, which primarily includes investment and
brokerage services income, increased $2.0 billion to $15.1
billion primarily due to higher market valuations and positive
AUM flows, partially offset by declines in AUM pricing.
The provision for credit losses improved $598 million to a
benefit of $241 million primarily due to improvements in the
macroeconomic outlook and credit quality. Noninterest expense
increased $1.1 billion to $15.3 billion primarily driven by higher
revenue-related incentives.
The return on average allocated capital was 26 percent, up
from 21 percent, due to higher net income, partially offset by an
increase in allocated capital. For more information on capital
allocated to the business segments, see Business Segment
Operations on page 75.
Average loans increased $13.5 billion to $196.9 billion
primarily driven by securities-based lending, custom lending and
residential mortgage. Average deposits increased $53.0 billion
to $340.1 billion primarily driven by inflows from new accounts
and client responses to market volatility.
MWM revenue of $17.4 billion increased 14 percent
primarily driven by the benefits of higher market valuations,
positive AUM flows and loan and deposit growth.
Bank of America Private Bank revenue of $3.3 billion
remained relatively flat with the benefits of higher market
valuations, AUM flows, and loan and deposit growth mostly
offset by the realignment of certain business results to MWM.

and not-for-profit companies. Business Banking clients include
mid-sized U.S.-based businesses requiring customized and
integrated financial advice and solutions.
Net income for Global Banking increased $6.3 billion to $9.8
billion driven by improvement in the provision for credit losses
and higher revenue, partially offset by higher noninterest
expense.
Net interest income decreased $502 million to $8.5 billion
primarily due to the impact of lower average loan balances and
deposit spreads, partially offset by the benefits of higher
deposit balances and credit spreads.
Noninterest income increased $2.4 billion to $12.4 billion
driven by higher investment banking fees, higher valuation-driven
adjustments on the fair value loan portfolio, debt securities and
leveraged loans, higher income from ESG investment activities,
as well as higher treasury and credit service charges.
The provision for credit losses improved $8.1 billion to a
benefit of $3.2 billion primarily driven by reserve releases due to
improvements in the macroeconomic outlook and credit quality.
Noninterest expense increased $1.3 billion to $10.6 billion,
primarily due to higher revenue-related incentives and higher
operating costs.
The return on average allocated capital was 23 percent, up
from eight percent, due to higher net income. For more
information on capital allocated to the business segments, see
Business Segment Operations on page 75.

Business Lending revenue increased $70 million in 2021
compared to 2020 primarily due to higher credit spreads and
income from ESG investment activities, partially offset by the
impact of lower average loan balances.
Global Transaction Services revenue increased $177 million
in 2021 compared to 2020 driven by the benefit of higher
deposit balances and treasury service charges, partially offset
by lower deposit spreads.
Average loans and leases decreased 14 percent in 2021
compared to 2020 driven by client paydowns and lower demand.
Average deposits increased 14 percent primarily driven by
elevated balances from prior-year inflows on client responses to
market volatility and government stimulus measures.
Global Investment Banking
Client teams and product specialists underwrite and distribute
debt, equity and loan products, and provide advisory services
and tailored risk management solutions. The economics of
certain investment banking and underwriting activities are
shared primarily between Global Banking and Global Markets
under an internal revenue-sharing arrangement. Global Banking
originates certain deal-related transactions with our corporate
and commercial clients that are executed and distributed by
Global Markets. To provide a complete discussion of our

Global Markets offers sales and trading services and research
services to institutional clients across fixed-income, credit,
currency, commodity and equity businesses. Global Markets
product coverage includes securities and derivative products in
both the primary and secondary markets. Global Markets
provides market-making, financing, securities clearing,
settlement and custody services globally to our institutional
investor clients in support of their investing and trading
activities. We also work with our commercial and corporate
clients to provide risk management products using interest rate,
equity, credit, currency and commodity derivatives, foreign
exchange, fixed-income and mortgage-related products. As a
result of our market-making activities in these products, we may
be required to manage risk in a broad range of financial
products including government securities, equity and equity-
linked securities, high-grade and high-yield corporate debt
securities, syndicated loans, MBS, commodities and asset-
backed securities. The economics of certain investment banking
and underwriting activities are shared primarily between Global
Markets and Global Banking under an internal revenue-sharing
arrangement. Global Banking originates certain deal-related
transactions with our corporate and commercial clients that are
executed and distributed by Global Markets. For information on
investment banking fees on a consolidated basis, see page 82.
The following explanations for year-over-year changes for
Global Markets, including those disclosed under Sales and
Trading Revenue, are the same for amounts including and
excluding net DVA. Amounts excluding net DVA are a non-GAAP
financial measure. For more information on net DVA, see
Supplemental Financial Data on page 70.
Net income for Global Markets decreased $695 million to
$4.6 billion. Net DVA losses were $54 million compared to
losses of $133 million in 2020. Excluding net DVA, net income
decreased $755 million to $4.6 billion. These decreases were
primarily driven by higher noninterest expense, partially offset by
higher revenue and lower provision for credit losses.
Revenue increased $490 million to $19.3 billion primarily
driven by higher investment banking fees and sales and trading
revenue. Sales and trading revenue increased $172 million, and
excluding net DVA, increased $93 million. These increases were
driven by higher revenue in Equities, partially offset by lower
revenue in FICC.
The provision for credit losses decreased $186 million
primarily due to an improved macroeconomic outlook.
Noninterest expense increased $1.6 billion to $13.0 billion
primarily driven by higher revenue-related expenses for sales
and trading as well as costs associated with processing

transactional card claims related to state unemployment
benefits.
Average total assets increased $101.0 billion to $786.0
billion. Year-end total assets increased $131.2 billion to
$747.8 billion. Both increases were primarily due to higher
client balances in Equities and higher levels of inventory and
loan growth in FICC.
The return on average allocated capital was 12 percent,
down from 15 percent, reflecting lower net income and an
increase in allocated capital. For more information on capital
allocated to the business segments, see Business Segment
Operations on page 75.

Sales and Trading Revenue
Sales and trading revenue includes unrealized and realized
gains and losses on trading and other assets which are
included in market making and similar activities, net interest
income, and fees primarily from commissions on equity
securities. Sales and trading revenue is segregated into fixed-
income (government debt obligations, investment and non-
investment grade corporate debt obligations, commercial MBS,
residential mortgage-backed securities, collateralized loan
obligations, interest rate and credit derivative contracts),
currencies (interest rate and foreign exchange contracts),
commodities (primarily futures, forwards, swaps and options)
and equities (equity-linked derivatives and cash equity activity).
The following table and related discussion present sales and
trading revenue, substantially all of which is in Global Markets,
with the remainder in Global Banking. In addition, the following

Equities net DVA losses were $5 million and $3 million for 2021 and 2020.
FICC revenue decreased $915 million driven by reduced
activity in macro products, partially offset by stronger
performance in credit and municipal products, and gains in
commodities (partially offset by related losses in another
segment) from market volatility driven by a weather-related event
in the first quarter of 2021. Equities revenue increased $1.0
billion driven by growth in client financing activities, a stronger
trading performance and increased client activity.

The provision for credit losses improved $232 million to a
benefit of $182 million primarily due to an improved
macroeconomic outlook.
Noninterest expense increased $107 million primarily due to
higher technology costs and the realignment of a liquidating
business activity from Global Markets to All Other in the fourth
quarter of 2021, partially offset by lower litigation expense. For
more information on realignment of the business activity, see
Note 23 3 Business Segment Information to the Consolidated

The income tax benefit was $8.1 billion in 2021 compared
to a benefit of $4.6 billion in 2020. The increase in the tax
benefit was primarily driven by the impact of U.K. tax law
changes and increased income tax credits in 2021. For more
information on U.K. tax law changes, see Financial Highlights 3

tax benefit adjustments to eliminate the FTE treatment of
certain tax credits recorded in Global Banking.

Managing Risk

Risk is inherent in all our business activities. Sound risk
management enables us to serve our customers and deliver for
our shareholders. If not managed well, risk can result in
financial loss, regulatory sanctions and penalties, and damage
to our reputation, each of which may adversely impact our ability
to execute our business strategies. We take a comprehensive
approach to risk management with a defined Risk Framework
and an articulated Risk Appetite Statement, which are approved
annually by the ERC and the Board.
The seven key types of risk faced by the Corporation are
strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and
reputational.

ï Strategic risk is the risk to current or projected financial
condition arising from incorrect assumptions about external
or internal factors, inappropriate business plans, ineffective
business strategy execution or failure to respond in a timely
manner to changes in the regulatory, macroeconomic or
competitive environments in the geographic locations in
which we operate.
ï Credit risk is the risk of loss arising from the inability or
failure of a borrower or counterparty to meet its obligations.
ï Market risk is the risk that changes in market conditions
adversely impact the value of assets or liabilities or
otherwise negatively impact earnings. Market risk is
composed of price risk and interest rate risk.
ï Liquidity risk is the inability to meet expected or unexpected
cash flow and collateral needs while continuing to support
our businesses and customers under a range of economic
conditions.
ï Compliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions,
material financial loss or damage to the reputation of the
Corporation arising from the failure of the Corporation to
comply with the requirements of applicable laws, rules and
regulations and our internal policies and procedures.
ï Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate
or failed internal processes or systems, people or external
events.
ï Reputational risk is the risk that negative perception of the
Corporation may adversely impact profitability or operations.

The following sections address in more detail the specific
procedures, measures and analyses of the major categories of
risk. This discussion of managing risk focuses on the current

Risk Framework that, as part of its annual review process, was
approved by the ERC and the Board.
As set forth in our Risk Framework, a culture of managing
risk well is fundamental to our values and our purpose, and how
we drive Responsible Growth. It requires us to focus on risk in
all activities and encourages the necessary mindset and
behavior to enable effective risk management and promote
sound risk-taking within our risk appetite. Sustaining a culture of
managing risk well throughout the organization is critical to the
success of the Corporation and is a clear expectation of our
executive management team and the Board.
Our Risk Framework serves as the foundation for the
consistent and effective management of risks facing the
Corporation. The Risk Framework sets forth roles and
responsibilities for the management of risk and provides a
blueprint for how the Board, through delegation of authority to
committees and executive officers, establishes risk appetite
and associated limits for our activities.
Executive management assesses, with Board oversight, the
risk-adjusted returns of each business. Management reviews
and approves the strategic and financial operating plans, as well
as the capital plan and Risk Appetite Statement, and
recommends them annually to the Board for approval. Our
strategic plan takes into consideration return objectives and
financial resources, which must align with risk capacity and risk
appetite. Management sets financial objectives for each
business by allocating capital and setting a target for return on
capital for each business. Capital allocations and operating
limits are regularly evaluated as part of our overall governance
processes as the businesses and the economic environment in
which we operate continue to evolve. For more information
regarding capital allocations, see Business Segment Operations
on page 75.
The Corporation9s risk appetite indicates the amount of
capital, earnings or liquidity we are willing to put at risk to
achieve our strategic objectives and business plans, consistent
with applicable regulatory requirements. Our risk appetite
provides a common set of measures for senior management
and the Board to clearly indicate the level of risk we are willing
to take in alignment with our strategic and capital plans and
ensure that the Corporation9s risk profile remains aligned with
our risk appetite. Our risk appetite is formally articulated in the
Risk Appetite Statement, which includes both qualitative
components and quantitative limits.
Our overall capacity to take risk is limited; therefore, we
prioritize the risks we take in order to maintain a strong and
flexible financial position so we can withstand challenging
economic conditions and take advantage of organic growth
opportunities. Therefore, we set objectives and targets for
capital and liquidity that are intended to permit us to continue to
operate in a safe and sound manner, including during periods of
stress.
Our lines of business operate with risk limits (which may
include credit, market and/or operational limits, as applicable)
that align with the Corporation9s risk appetite. Executive
management is responsible for tracking and reporting
performance measurements as well as any exceptions to
guidelines or limits. The Board, and its committees when
appropriate, oversee financial performance, execution of the
strategic and financial operating plans, adherence to risk
appetite limits and the adequacy of internal controls.
For a more detailed discussion of our risk management
activities, see the discussion below and pages 88 through 121.
For more information about the Corporation's risks related to
the pandemic, see Item 1A. Risk Factors of our 2021 Annual
Bank of America 2021 85
Report on Form 10-K. These COVID-19 related risks are being
managed within our Risk Framework and supporting risk
management programs.

Risk Management Governance
The Risk Framework describes delegations of authority whereby
the Board and its committees may delegate authority to
management-level committees or executive officers. Such
delegations may authorize certain decision-making and approval

functions, which may be evidenced in documents such as
committee charters, job descriptions, meeting minutes and
resolutions.
The chart below illustrates the interrelationship among the
Board, Board committees and management committees that
have the majority of risk oversight responsibilities for the
Corporation.
Board of Directors and Board Committees
The Board is composed of 16 directors, all but one of whom are
independent. The Board authorizes management to maintain an
effective Risk Framework and oversees compliance with safe
and sound banking practices. In addition, the Board or its
committees conduct inquiries of, and receive reports from
management on, risk-related matters to assess scope or
resource limitations that could impede the ability of Global Risk
Management (GRM) and/or Corporate Audit to execute its
responsibilities. The Board committees discussed below have
the principal responsibility for enterprise-wide oversight of our
risk management activities. Through these activities, the Board
and applicable committees are provided with information on our
risk profile and oversee executive management addressing key
risks we face. Other Board committees, as described below,
provide additional oversight of specific risks.
Each of the committees shown on the above chart regularly
reports to the Board on risk-related matters within the
committee9s responsibilities, which is intended to collectively
provide the Board with integrated insight about our management
of enterprise-wide risks.

Audit Committee
The Audit Committee oversees the qualifications, performance
and independence of the Independent Registered Public
Accounting Firm, the performance of our corporate audit
function, the integrity of our consolidated financial statements,
our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, and
makes inquiries of management or the Chief Audit Executive
(CAE) to determine whether there are scope or resource
limitations that impede the ability of Corporate Audit to execute
its responsibilities. The Audit Committee is also responsible for
overseeing compliance risks pursuant to the New York Stock
Exchange listing standards.

Enterprise Risk Committee
The ERC has primary responsibility for oversight of the Risk

Framework and key risks we face and of the Corporation9s
overall risk appetite. It approves the Risk Framework and the
Risk Appetite Statement and further recommends these
documents to the Board for approval. The ERC oversees senior
management9s responsibilities for the identification,
measurement, monitoring and control of key risks we face. The
ERC may consult with other Board committees on risk-related
matters.
Other Board Committees
Our Corporate Governance, ESG, and Sustainability Committee
oversees our Board9s governance processes, identifies and
reviews the qualifications of potential Board members,
recommends nominees for election to our Board, recommends
committee appointments for Board approval and reviews our
ESG and stockholder engagement activities.
Our Compensation and Human Capital Committee oversees
establishing, maintaining and administering our compensation
programs and employee benefit plans, including approving and
recommending our Chief Executive Officer9s (CEO) compensation
to our Board for further approval by all independent directors;
reviewing and approving our executive officers9 compensation,
as well as compensation for non-management directors; and
reviewing certain other human capital management topics.
Management Committees
Management committees receive their authority from the Board,
a Board committee, another management committee or from
one or more executive officers. Our primary management risk
committee is the MRC. Subject to Board oversight, the MRC is
responsible for management oversight of key risks facing the
Corporation, including an integrated evaluation of risk, earnings,
capital and liquidity.
Lines of Defense
We have clear ownership and accountability for managing risk
across three lines of defense: Front Line Units (FLUs), GRM and
86 Bank of America 2021
Corporate Audit. We also have control functions outside of FLUs
and GRM (e.g., Legal and Global Human Resources). The three
lines of defense are integrated into our management-level
governance structure. Each of these functional roles is further
described in this section.

Executive Officers
Executive officers lead various functions representing the
functional roles. Authority for functional roles may be delegated
to executive officers from the Board, Board committees or
management-level committees. Executive officers, in turn, may
further delegate responsibilities, as appropriate, to
management-level committees, management routines or
individuals. Executive officers review our activities for
consistency with our Risk Framework, risk appetite, and
applicable strategic, capital and financial operating plans, as
well as applicable policies and standards. Executive officers and
other employees make decisions individually on a day-to-day
basis, consistent with the authority they have been delegated.
Executive officers and other employees may also serve on
committees and participate in committee decisions.

Front Line Units
FLUs, which include the lines of business as well as Global
Technology and Global Operations, are responsible for
appropriately assessing and effectively managing all of the risks
associated with their activities.
Three organizational units that include FLU activities and
control function activities, but are not part of GRM are first, the
Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Group; second, the Chief
Administrative Officer (CAO) Group; and third, Global Strategy
and Enterprise Platforms (GSEP).

Global Risk Management
GRM is part of our control functions and operates as our
independent risk management function. GRM, led by the Chief
Risk Officer (CRO), is responsible for independently assessing
and overseeing risks within FLUs and other control functions.
GRM establishes written enterprise policies and procedures
outlining how aggregate risks are identified, measured,
monitored and controlled.
The CRO has the stature, authority and independence needed
to develop and implement a meaningful risk management
framework and practices to guide the Corporation in managing
risk. The CRO has unrestricted access to the Board and reports
directly to both the ERC and the CEO. GRM is organized into
horizontal risk teams that cover a specific risk area and vertical
CRO teams that cover a particular FLU or control function. These
teams work collaboratively in executing their respective duties.

Corporate Audit
Corporate Audit and the CAE maintain their independence from
the FLUs, GRM and other control functions by reporting directly
to the Audit Committee. The CAE administratively reports to the
CEO. Corporate Audit provides independent assessment and
validation through testing of key processes and controls across
the Corporation. Corporate Audit includes Credit Review, which
provides an independent assessment of credit lending decisions
and the effectiveness of credit processes across the
Corporation9s credit platform through examinations and
monitoring.

Risk Management Processes
The Risk Framework requires that strong risk management
practices are integrated in key strategic, capital and financial
planning processes and in day-to-day business processes

across the Corporation, thereby ensuring risks are appropriately
considered, evaluated and responded to in a timely manner. We
employ an effective risk management process, referred to as
Identify, Measure, Monitor and Control, as part of our daily
activities.
Identify 3 To be effectively managed, risks must be proactively
identified and well understood. Proper risk identification
focuses on recognizing and understanding key risks inherent
in our business activities or key risks that may arise from
external factors. Each employee is expected to identify and
escalate risks promptly. Risk identification is an ongoing
process that incorporates input from FLUs and control
functions. It is designed to be forward-looking and to capture
relevant risk factors across all of our lines of business.
Measure 3 Once a risk is identified, it must be prioritized and
accurately measured through a systematic process including
quantitative and qualitative components. Risk is measured at
various levels, including, but not limited to, risk type, FLU and
legal entity, and also on an aggregate basis. This risk
measurement process helps to capture changes in our risk
profile due to changes in strategic direction, concentrations,
portfolio quality and the overall economic environment. Senior
management considers how risk exposures might evolve
under a variety of stress scenarios.
Monitor 3 We monitor risk levels regularly to track adherence to
risk appetite, policies and standards. We also regularly
update risk assessments and review risk exposures. Through
our monitoring, we know our level of risk relative to limits and
can take action in a timely manner. We also know when risk
limits are breached and have processes to appropriately
report and escalate exceptions. This includes timely requests
for approval to managers and alerts to executive
management, management-level committees or the Board
(directly or through an appropriate committee).
Control 3 We establish and communicate risk limits and controls
through policies, standards, procedures and processes. The
limits and controls can be adjusted by the Board or
management when conditions or risk tolerances warrant.
These limits may be absolute (e.g., loan amount, trading
volume, operational loss) or relative (e.g., percentage of loan
book in higher-risk categories). Our FLUs are held accountable
for performing within the established limits.
The formal processes used to manage risk represent a part
of our overall risk management process. We instill a strong and
comprehensive culture of managing risk well through
communications, training, policies, procedures and
organizational roles and responsibilities. Establishing a culture
reflective of our purpose to help make our customers9 financial
lives better and delivering on Responsible Growth is also critical
to effective risk management. We are committed to the highest
principles of ethical and professional conduct. Conduct risk is
the risk of improper actions, behaviors or practices that are
illegal, unethical and/or contrary to our core values that could
result in harm to the Corporation, our shareholders or our
customers, damage the integrity of the financial markets, or
negatively impact our reputation. We have established protocols
and structures so that conduct risk is governed and reported
across the Corporation appropriately. All employees are held
accountable for adhering to the Code of Conduct, operating
within our risk appetite and managing risk in their daily business
activities. In addition, our performance management and
compensation practices encourage responsible risk-taking that
is consistent with our Risk Framework and risk appetite.
Bank of America 2021 87
Corporation-wide Stress Testing
Integral to our Capital Planning, Financial Planning and Strategic
Planning processes, we conduct capital scenario management
and stress forecasting on a periodic basis to better understand
balance sheet, earnings and capital sensitivities to certain
economic and business scenarios, including economic and
market conditions that are more severe than anticipated. These
stress forecasts provide an understanding of the potential
impacts from our risk profile on the balance sheet, earnings and
capital, and serve as a key component of our capital and risk
management practices. The intent of stress testing is to
develop a comprehensive understanding of potential impacts of
on- and off-balance sheet risks at the Corporation and certain
subsidiaries and how they impact financial resiliency, which
provides confidence to management, regulators and our
investors.

Contingency Planning
We have developed and maintain contingency plans that are
designed to prepare us in advance to respond in the event of
potential adverse economic, financial or market stress. These
contingency plans include our Capital Contingency Plan and
Financial Contingency and Recovery Plan, which provide
monitoring, escalation, actions and routines designed to enable
us to increase capital, access funding sources and reduce risk
through consideration of potential options that include asset
sales, business sales, capital or debt issuances, or other de-
risking strategies. We also maintain a Resolution Plan to limit
adverse systemic impacts that could be associated with a
potential resolution of Bank of America.

Strategic Risk Management

Strategic risk is embedded in every business and is one of the
major risk categories along with credit, market, liquidity,
compliance, operational and reputational risks. This risk results
from incorrect assumptions about external or internal factors,
inappropriate business plans, ineffective business strategy
execution, or failure to respond in a timely manner to changes in
the regulatory, macroeconomic or competitive environments in
the geographic locations in which we operate, such as
competitor actions, changing customer preferences, product
obsolescence and technology developments. Our strategic plan
is consistent with our risk appetite, capital plan and liquidity
requirements, and specifically addresses strategic risks.
On an annual basis, the Board reviews and approves the
strategic plan, capital plan, financial operating plan and Risk
Appetite Statement. With oversight by the Board, executive
management directs the lines of business to execute our
strategic plan consistent with our core operating principles and
risk appetite. The executive management team monitors
business performance throughout the year and provides the
Board with regular progress reports on whether strategic
objectives and timelines are being met, including reports on
strategic risks and if additional or alternative actions need to be
considered or implemented. The regular executive reviews focus
on assessing forecasted earnings and returns on capital, the
current risk profile, current capital and liquidity requirements,
staffing levels and changes required to support the strategic
plan, stress testing results, and other qualitative factors such
as market growth rates and peer analysis.
Significant strategic actions, such as capital actions,
material acquisitions or divestitures, and resolution plans are
reviewed and approved by the Board. At the business level,
processes are in place to discuss the strategic risk implications
of new, expanded or modified businesses, products or services

and other strategic initiatives, and to provide formal review and
approval where required. With oversight by the Board and the
ERC, executive management performs similar analyses
throughout the year, and evaluates changes to the financial
forecast or the risk, capital or liquidity positions as deemed
appropriate to balance and optimize achieving the targeted risk
appetite, shareholder returns and maintaining the targeted
financial strength. Proprietary models are used to measure the
capital requirements for credit, country, market, operational and
strategic risks. The allocated capital assigned to each business
is based on its unique risk profile. With oversight by the Board,
executive management assesses the risk-adjusted returns of
each business in approving strategic and financial operating
plans. The businesses use allocated capital to define business
strategies, and price products and transactions.
Capital Management
The Corporation manages its capital position so that its capital
is more than adequate to support its business activities and
aligns with risk, risk appetite and strategic planning.
Additionally, we seek to maintain safety and soundness at all
times, even under adverse scenarios, take advantage of organic
growth opportunities, meet obligations to creditors and
counterparties, maintain ready access to financial markets,
continue to serve as a credit intermediary, remain a source of
strength for our subsidiaries, and satisfy current and future
regulatory capital requirements. Capital management is
integrated into our risk and governance processes, as capital is
a key consideration in the development of our strategic plan,
risk appetite and risk limits.
We conduct an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment
Process (ICAAP) on a periodic basis. The ICAAP is a forward-
looking assessment of our projected capital needs and
resources, incorporating earnings, balance sheet and risk
forecasts under baseline and adverse economic and market
conditions. We utilize periodic stress tests to assess the
potential impacts to our balance sheet, earnings, regulatory
capital and liquidity under a variety of stress scenarios. We
perform qualitative risk assessments to identify and assess
material risks not fully captured in our forecasts or stress tests.
We assess the potential capital impacts of proposed changes to
regulatory capital requirements. Management assesses ICAAP
results and provides documented quarterly assessments of the
adequacy of our capital guidelines and capital position to the
Board or its committees.
We periodically review capital allocated to our businesses
and allocate capital annually during the strategic and capital
planning processes. For more information, see Business
Segment Operations on page 75.
CCAR and Capital Planning
The Federal Reserve requires BHCs to submit a capital plan and
planned capital actions on an annual basis, consistent with the
rules governing the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review
(CCAR) capital plan. Based on the results of our 2021 CCAR
capital plan and related supervisory stress tests, we are subject
to a 2.5 percent stress capital buffer (SCB), unchanged from the
prior level, effective October 1, 2021 through September 30,
Our Common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio under the
Standardized approach must remain above 9.5 percent during
this period in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions
and discretionary bonus payments.
Due to uncertainty resulting from the pandemic, the Federal
Reserve imposed various restrictions on share repurchase
programs and dividends during 2020 and the first half of 2021.
88 Bank of America 2021
In conjunction with its release of 2021 CCAR supervisory stress
test results, the Federal Reserve announced those restrictions
would end as of July 1, 2021 for large banks, including the
Corporation, and large banks would be subject to the normal
restrictions under the Federal Reserve's SCB framework. On
October 20, 2021, we announced that the Board renewed the
Corporation9s $25 billion common stock repurchase program
previously announced in April 2021. The Board9s authorization
replaced the previous program. As with the April authorization,
the Board also authorized common stock repurchases to offset
shares awarded under the Corporation9s equity-based
compensation plans. Pursuant to the Board9s authorization,
during 2021 we repurchased $25.1 billion of common stock,
including repurchases to offset shares awarded under equity-
based compensation plans.
The timing and amount of common stock repurchases made
pursuant to our stock repurchase program are subject to various
factors, including the Corporation9s capital position, liquidity,
financial performance and alternative uses of capital, stock
trading price, regulatory requirements and general market
conditions, and may be suspended at any time. Such
repurchases may be effected through open market purchases or
privately negotiated transactions, including repurchase plans
that satisfy the conditions of Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act).

Regulatory Capital
As a financial services holding company, we are subject to
regulatory capital rules, including Basel 3, issued by U.S.
banking regulators. Basel 3 established minimum capital ratios
and buffer requirements and outlined two methods of
calculating risk-weighted assets (RWA), the Standardized
approach and the Advanced approaches. The Standardized
approach relies primarily on supervisory risk weights based on
exposure type, and the Advanced approaches determine risk
weights based on internal models.
The Corporation's depository institution subsidiaries are also
subject to the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework. The
Corporation and its primary affiliated banking entity, BANA, are
Advanced approaches institutions under Basel 3 and are
required to report regulatory risk-based capital ratios and RWA
under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. The
approach that yields the lower ratio is used to assess capital
adequacy, including under the PCA framework. As of
December 31, 2021, the CET1, Tier 1 capital and Total capital
ratios for the Corporation were lower under the Standardized
approach.

Minimum Capital Requirements
In order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and
discretionary bonus payments, the Corporation must meet risk-
based capital ratio requirements that include a capital

conservation buffer of 2.5 percent (under the Advanced
approaches only), an SCB (under the Standardized approach
only), plus any applicable countercyclical capital buffer and a
global systemically important bank (G-SIB) surcharge. Including
a regulatory minimum requirement of 4.5 percent, an SCB of
2.5 percent and a G-SIB surcharge of 2.5 percent, the
Corporation's CET1 capital ratio must be a minimum of 9.5
percent under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches.
The Corporation is required to calculate its G-SIB surcharge
on an annual basis under two methods and is subject to the
higher of the resulting two surcharges. Method 1 is consistent
with the approach prescribed by the Basel Committee9s
assessment methodology and is calculated using specified
indicators of systemic importance. Method 2 modifies the
Method 1 approach by, among other factors, including a
measure of the Corporation9s reliance on short-term wholesale
funding. The Corporation9s G-SIB surcharge, which is higher
under Method 2, is expected to increase to 3.0 percent on
January 1, 2024 unless its surcharge calculated as of
December 31, 2022 is lower than 3.0 percent.
The current SCB of 2.5 percent, which remains effective from
October 1, 2021 through September 30, 2022, could change
based on results of the 2022 CCAR capital plan and related
supervisory stress tests to be submitted in the first half of
2022.
The Corporation is also required to maintain a minimum
supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) of 3.0 percent plus a
leverage buffer of 2.0 percent in order to avoid certain
restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus
payments. Our insured depository institution subsidiaries are
required to maintain a minimum 6.0 percent SLR to be
considered well capitalized under the PCA framework. The
numerator of the SLR is quarter-end Basel 3 Tier 1 capital. The
denominator is total leverage exposure based on the daily
average of the sum of on-balance sheet exposures less
permitted deductions, and applicable temporary exclusions, as
well as the simple average of certain off-balance sheet
exposures, as of the end of each month in a quarter. The
temporary exclusions expired after March 31, 2021 and were
not applicable for December 31, 2021. For more information,
see Capital Management 3 Regulatory Developments on page
93.

Supplementary leverage exposure at December 31, 2020 reflects the temporary exclusion of U.S. Treasury Securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks. The temporary relief expired after
March 31, 2021 and is not reflected in supplementary leverage exposure at December 31, 2021.
Regulatory Developments
Supplementary Leverage Ratio
On March 19, 2021, U.S. banking regulators announced that
temporary changes issued in 2020 for BHCs and depository
institutions would expire as scheduled after March 31, 2021.
These temporary changes to the SLR allowed the exclusion of
on-balance sheet amounts of U.S. Treasury securities and
deposits at Federal Reserve Banks from the calculation of
supplementary leverage exposure. While the temporary relief
automatically applied to the Corporation, the Corporation9s lead
depository institution, Bank of America, N.A., did not opt to take
advantage of the SLR relief offered by the OCC. At December
31, 2021, the Corporation9s SLR was 5.5 percent, which
exceeds the 5.0 percent minimum required by the Federal
Reserve.
Regulatory Capital and Securities Regulation
The Corporation9s principal U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are
BofA Securities, Inc. (BofAS), Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing
Corp. (MLPCC) and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith
Incorporated (MLPF&S). The Corporation's principal European
broker-dealer subsidiaries are Merrill Lynch International (MLI)
and BofA Securities Europe SA (BofASE).
The U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to the net
capital requirements of Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act.
BofAS computes its minimum capital requirements as an
alternative net capital broker-dealer under Rule 15c3-1e, and
MLPCC and MLPF&S compute their minimum capital
requirements in accordance with the alternative standard under
Rule 15c3-1. BofAS and MLPCC are also registered as futures
commission merchants and are subject to Commodity Futures
Trading Commission (CFTC) Regulation 1.17. The U.S. broker-
dealer subsidiaries are also registered with the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA). Pursuant to FINRA
Rule 4110, FINRA may impose higher net capital requirements
than Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act with respect to each
of the broker-dealers.
BofAS provides institutional services, and in accordance with
the alternative net capital requirements, is required to maintain
tentative net capital in excess of $5.0 billion and net capital in
excess of the greater of $1.0 billion or a certain percentage of
its reserve requirement in addition to a certain percentage of
securities-based swap risk margin. BofAS must also notify the
SEC in the event its tentative net capital is less than $6.0
billion. BofAS is also required to hold a certain percentage of its
customers' and affiliates' risk-based margin in order to meet its
CFTC minimum net capital requirement. At December 31, 2021,
BofAS had tentative net capital of $19.4 billion. BofAS also had
regulatory net capital of $16.6 billion, which exceeded the
minimum requirement of $3.5 billion.
MLPCC is a fully-guaranteed subsidiary of BofAS and
provides clearing and settlement services as well as prime
brokerage and arranged financing services for institutional
clients. At December 31, 2021, MLPCC9s regulatory net capital
of $6.2 billion exceeded the minimum requirement of $1.5
billion.
MLPF&S provides retail services. At December 31, 2021,
MLPF&S' regulatory net capital was $5.7 billion, which exceeded
the minimum requirement of $199 million.
Our European broker-dealers are regulated by non-U.S.
regulators. MLI, a U.K. investment firm, is regulated by the
Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct
Authority and is subject to certain regulatory capital
requirements. At December 31, 2021, MLI9s capital resources
were $33.6 billion, which exceeded the minimum Pillar 1
requirement of $14.0 billion. BofASE, a French investment firm,
is regulated by the Autorité de Contrôle Prudentiel et de
Résolution and the Autorité des Marchés Financiers, and is
subject to certain regulatory capital requirements. At
December 31, 2021, BofASE's capital resources were $7.9
billion, which exceeded the minimum Pillar 1 requirement of
$2.8 billion.
Liquidity Risk
Funding and Liquidity Risk Management
Our primary liquidity risk management objective is to meet
expected or unexpected cash flow and collateral requirements,
including payments under long-term debt agreements,
commitments to extend credit and customer deposit
withdrawals, while continuing to support our businesses and
customers under a range of economic conditions. To achieve
that objective, we analyze and monitor our liquidity risk under
expected and stressed conditions, maintain liquidity and access
to diverse funding sources, including our stable deposit base,
and seek to align liquidity-related incentives and risks. These
liquidity risk management practices have allowed us to
effectively manage the market fluctuation from the pandemic.
For more information on the risks of the pandemic, see Part I.
Item 1A. Risk Factors of our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K
and Executive Summary 3 Recent Developments 3 COVID-19
Bank of America 2021 93

(^)
Pandemic on page 66.
We define liquidity as readily available assets, limited to
cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities that we
can use to meet our contractual and contingent financial
obligations as they arise. We manage our liquidity position
through line-of-business and ALM activities, as well as through
our legal entity funding strategy, on both a forward and current
(including intraday) basis under both expected and stressed
conditions. We believe that a centralized approach to funding
and liquidity management enhances our ability to monitor
liquidity requirements, maximizes access to funding sources,
minimizes borrowing costs and facilitates timely responses to
liquidity events.
The Board approves our liquidity risk policy and the Financial
Contingency and Recovery Plan. The ERC establishes our
liquidity risk tolerance levels. The MRC is responsible for
overseeing liquidity risks and directing management to maintain
exposures within the established tolerance levels. The MRC
reviews and monitors our liquidity position and stress testing
results, approves certain liquidity risk limits and reviews the
impact of strategic decisions on our liquidity. For more
information, see Managing Risk on page 85. Under this
governance framework, we developed certain funding and
liquidity risk management practices which include: maintaining
liquidity at the parent company and selected subsidiaries,
including our bank subsidiaries and other regulated entities;
determining what amounts of liquidity are appropriate for these
entities based on analysis of debt maturities and other potential
cash outflows, including those that we may experience during
stressed market conditions; diversifying funding sources,
considering our asset profile and legal entity structure; and
performing contingency planning.
NB Holdings Corporation
The parent company, which is a separate and distinct legal
entity from our bank and nonbank subsidiaries, has an
intercompany arrangement with our wholly-owned holding
company subsidiary, NB Holdings Corporation (NB Holdings).
We have transferred, and agreed to transfer, additional parent
company assets not required to satisfy anticipated near-term
expenditures to NB Holdings. The parent company is expected
to continue to have access to the same flow of dividends,
interest and other amounts of cash necessary to service its
debt, pay dividends and perform other obligations as it would
have had it not entered into these arrangements and transferred
any assets. These arrangements support our preferred single
point of entry resolution strategy, under which only the parent
company would be resolved under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
In consideration for the transfer of assets, NB Holdings
issued a subordinated note to the parent company in a principal
amount equal to the value of the transferred assets. The
aggregate principal amount of the note will increase by the
amount of any future asset transfers. NB Holdings also provided
the parent company with a committed line of credit that allows
the parent company to draw funds necessary to service near-
term cash needs. These arrangements support our preferred
single point of entry resolution strategy, under which only the
parent company would be resolved under the U.S. Bankruptcy
Code. These arrangements include provisions to terminate the
line of credit, forgive the subordinated note and require the
parent company to transfer its remaining financial assets to NB
Holdings if our projected liquidity resources deteriorate so
severely that resolution of the parent company becomes
imminent.
Global Liquidity Sources and Other Unencumbered Assets
We maintain liquidity available to the Corporation, including the
parent company and selected subsidiaries, in the form of cash
and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities. Our liquidity
buffer, referred to as Global Liquidity Sources (GLS), is
comprised of assets that are readily available to the parent
company and selected subsidiaries, including holding company,
bank and broker-dealer subsidiaries, even during stressed
market conditions. Our cash is primarily on deposit with the
Federal Reserve Bank and, to a lesser extent, central banks
outside of the U.S. We limit the composition of high-quality,
liquid, unencumbered securities to U.S. government securities,
U.S. agency securities, U.S. agency MBS and other investment-
grade securities, and a select group of non-U.S. government
securities. We can obtain cash for these securities, even in
stressed conditions, through repurchase agreements or outright
sales. We hold our GLS in legal entities that allow us to meet
the liquidity requirements of our global businesses, and we
consider the impact of potential regulatory, tax, legal and other
restrictions that could limit the transferability of funds among
entities.
Table 15 presents average GLS for the three months ended

(1) (^) Nonbank includes Parent, NB Holdings and other regulated entities.
Our bank subsidiaries9 liquidity is primarily driven by deposit
and lending activity, as well as securities valuation and net debt
activity. Bank subsidiaries can also generate incremental
liquidity by pledging a range of unencumbered loans and
securities to certain FHLBs and the Federal Reserve Discount
Window. The cash we could have obtained by borrowing against
this pool of specifically-identified eligible assets was $322
billion and $306 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020. We
have established operational procedures to enable us to borrow
against these assets, including regularly monitoring our total
pool of eligible loans and securities collateral. Eligibility is
defined in guidelines from the FHLBs and the Federal Reserve
and is subject to change at their discretion. Due to regulatory
restrictions, liquidity generated by the bank subsidiaries can
generally be used only to fund obligations within the bank
subsidiaries, and transfers to the parent company or nonbank
subsidiaries may be subject to prior regulatory approval.
Liquidity is also held in nonbank entities, including the
Parent, NB Holdings and other regulated entities. Parent
company and NB Holdings liquidity is typically in the form of
cash deposited at BANA, which is excluded from the liquidity at
bank subsidiaries, and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered
securities. Liquidity held in other regulated entities, comprised
primarily of broker-dealer subsidiaries, is primarily available to
meet the obligations of that entity, and transfers to the parent
company or to any other subsidiary may be subject to prior
regulatory approval due to regulatory restrictions and minimum
requirements. Our other regulated entities also hold
unencumbered investment-grade securities and equities that we
believe could be used to generate additional liquidity.

Our GLS are substantially the same in composition to what
qualifies as High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) under the final
U.S. Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) rules. However, HQLA for
purposes of calculating LCR is not reported at market value, but
at a lower value that incorporates regulatory deductions and the
exclusion of excess liquidity held at certain subsidiaries. The
LCR is calculated as the amount of a financial institution9s
unencumbered HQLA relative to the estimated net cash outflows
the institution could encounter over a 30-day period of
significant liquidity stress, expressed as a percentage. Our
average consolidated HQLA, on a net basis, was $617 billion
and $584 billion for the three months ended December 31,
2021 and 2020. For the same periods, the average
consolidated LCR was 115 percent and 122 percent. Our LCR
fluctuates due to normal business flows from customer activity.

Liquidity Stress Analysis
We utilize liquidity stress analysis to assist us in determining
the appropriate amounts of liquidity to maintain at the parent
company and our subsidiaries to meet contractual and
contingent cash outflows under a range of scenarios. The
scenarios we consider and utilize incorporate market-wide and
Corporation-specific events, including potential credit rating
downgrades for the parent company and our subsidiaries, and
more severe events including potential resolution scenarios. The
scenarios are based on our historical experience, experience of
distressed and failed financial institutions, regulatory guidance,
and both expected and unexpected future events.
The types of potential contractual and contingent cash
outflows we consider in our scenarios may include, but are not
limited to, upcoming contractual maturities of unsecured debt
and reductions in new debt issuances; diminished access to
secured financing markets; potential deposit withdrawals;
increased draws on loan commitments, liquidity facilities and
letters of credit; additional collateral that counterparties could
call if our credit ratings were downgraded; collateral and margin
requirements arising from market value changes; and potential
liquidity required to maintain businesses and finance customer
activities. Changes in certain market factors, including, but not
limited to, credit rating downgrades, could negatively impact
potential contractual and contingent outflows and the related
financial instruments, and in some cases these impacts could
be material to our financial results.
We consider all sources of funds that we could access
during each stress scenario and focus particularly on matching
available sources with corresponding liquidity requirements by
legal entity. We also use the stress modeling results to manage
our asset and liability profile and establish limits and guidelines
on certain funding sources and businesses.

Net Stable Funding Ratio Final Rule
On October 20, 2020, U.S. banking regulators finalized the Net
Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), a rule requiring large banks to
maintain a minimum level of stable funding over a one-year
period. The final rule is intended to support the ability of banks
to lend to households and businesses in both normal and
adverse economic conditions and is complementary to the LCR
rule, which focuses on short-term liquidity risks. The final rule
was effective July 1, 2021, and the Corporation is in
compliance. The U.S. NSFR applies to the Corporation on a
consolidated basis and to our insured depository institutions.
There have not been any significant impacts to the Corporation.
Diversified Funding Sources
We fund our assets primarily with a mix of deposits, and
secured and unsecured liabilities through a centralized, globally
coordinated funding approach diversified across products,
programs, markets, currencies and investor groups.
The primary benefits of our centralized funding approach
include greater control, reduced funding costs, wider name
recognition by investors and greater flexibility to meet the
variable funding requirements of subsidiaries. Where
regulations, time zone differences or other business
considerations make parent company funding impractical,
certain other subsidiaries may issue their own debt.
We fund a substantial portion of our lending activities
through our deposits, which were $2.1 trillion and $1.8 trillion
at December 31, 2021 and 2020. Deposits are primarily
generated by our Consumer Banking, GWIM and Global Banking
segments. These deposits are diversified by clients, product
type and geography, and the majority of our U.S. deposits are
insured by the FDIC. We consider a substantial portion of our
deposits to be a stable, low-cost and consistent source of
funding. We believe this deposit funding is generally less
sensitive to interest rate changes, market volatility or changes
in our credit ratings than wholesale funding sources. Our lending
activities may also be financed through secured borrowings,
including credit card securitizations and securitizations with
government-sponsored enterprises (GSE), the Federal Housing
Administration (FHA) and private-label investors, as well as FHLB
loans.
Our trading activities in other regulated entities are primarily
funded on a secured basis through securities lending and
repurchase agreements, and these amounts will vary based on
customer activity and market conditions. We believe funding
these activities in the secured financing markets is more cost-
efficient and less sensitive to changes in our credit ratings than
unsecured financing. Repurchase agreements are generally
short-term and often overnight. Disruptions in secured financing
markets for financial institutions have occurred in prior market
cycles which resulted in adverse changes in terms or significant
reductions in the availability of such financing. We manage the
liquidity risks arising from secured funding by sourcing funding
globally from a diverse group of counterparties, providing a
range of securities collateral and pursuing longer durations,
when appropriate. For more information on secured financing
agreements, see Note 10 3 Securities Financing Agreements,
Short-term Borrowings and Restricted Cash to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.
Total long-term debt increased $17.2 billion to $280.1
billion during 2021, primarily due to debt issuances, partially
offset by debt maturities, redemptions and valuation
adjustments. We may, from time to time, purchase outstanding
debt instruments in various transactions, depending on market
conditions, liquidity and other factors. Our other regulated
Bank of America 2021 95
entities may also make markets in our debt instruments to
provide liquidity for investors.
During 2021, we issued $76.7 billion of long-term debt
consisting of $56.2 billion of notes issued by Bank of America
Corporation, substantially all of which were TLAC compliant,
$8.0 billion of notes issued by Bank of America, N.A. and $12.5
billion of other debt. During 2020, we issued $56.9 billion of
long-term debt consisting of $43.8 billion of notes issued by
Bank of America Corporation, substantially all of which were
TLAC compliant, $4.8 billion of notes issued by Bank of
America, N.A. and $8.3 billion of other debt.
During 2021, we had total long-term debt maturities and
redemptions in the aggregate of $46.4 billion consisting of
$24.4 billion for Bank of America Corporation, $10.4 billion for
Bank of America, N.A. and $11.6 billion of other debt. During
2020, we had total long-term debt maturities and redemptions
in the aggregate of $47.1 billion consisting of $22.6 billion for
Bank of America Corporation, $11.5 billion for Bank of America,
N.A. and $13.0 billion of other debt.
At December 31, 2021, Bank of America Corporation's
senior notes of $212.9 billion included $179.5 billion of
outstanding notes that are both TLAC eligible and callable at
least one year before their stated maturities. Of these senior
notes, $15.0 billion will be callable and become TLAC ineligible
during 2022, and $17.0 billion, $17.8 billion, $15.0 billion and
$17.7 billion will do so during each of 2023 through 2026,
respectively, and $97.0 billion thereafter.
We issue long-term unsecured debt in a variety of maturities
and currencies to achieve cost-efficient funding and to maintain
an appropriate maturity profile. While the cost and availability of
unsecured funding may be negatively impacted by general
market conditions or by matters specific to the financial
services industry or the Corporation, we seek to mitigate
refinancing risk by actively managing the amount of our
borrowings that we anticipate will mature within any month or
quarter. We may issue unsecured debt in the form of structured
notes for client purposes, certain of which qualify as TLAC-
eligible debt. During 2021, we issued $7.1 billion of structured
notes, which are debt obligations that pay investors returns
linked to other debt or equity securities, indices, currencies or
commodities. We typically hedge the returns we are obligated to
pay on these liabilities with derivatives and/or investments in
the underlying instruments, so that from a funding perspective,
the cost is similar to our other unsecured long-term debt. We
could be required to settle certain structured note obligations
for cash or other securities prior to maturity under certain
circumstances, which we consider for liquidity planning
purposes. We believe, however, that a portion of such
borrowings will remain outstanding beyond the earliest put or
redemption date.
Substantially all of our senior and subordinated debt
obligations contain no provisions that could trigger a
requirement for an early repayment, require additional collateral
support, result in changes to terms, accelerate maturity or
create additional financial obligations upon an adverse change
in our credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings, cash flows or
stock price. For more information on long-term debt funding,
including issuances and maturities and redemptions, see Note
11 3 Long-term Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
We use derivative transactions to manage the duration,
interest rate and currency risks of our borrowings, considering
the characteristics of the assets they are funding. For more
information on our ALM activities, see Interest Rate Risk
Management for the Banking Book on page 118.

Uninsured Deposits
The FDIC insures the Corporation9s U.S. deposits up to
$250,000 per depositor, per insured bank for each account
ownership category, and various country-specific funds insure
non-U.S. deposits up to specified limits. Deposits that exceed
insurance limits are uninsured. At December 31, 2021, the
Corporation9s deposits totaled $2.1 trillion, of which total
estimated uninsured U.S. and non-U.S. deposits were
$701.4 billion and $111.9 billion. At December 31, 2020, the
Corporation9s deposits totaled $1.8 trillion, of which total
estimated uninsured U.S. and non-U.S. deposits were $597.7
billion and $104.1 billion.
Table 17 presents information about the Corporation9s total
estimated uninsured time deposits. For more information on our
liquidity sources, see Global Liquidity Sources and Other
Unencumbered Assets, and for more information on deposits,
see Diversified Funding Sources in this section. For more
information on contractual time deposit maturities, see Note 9 3

Contingency Planning
We maintain contingency funding plans that outline our potential
responses to liquidity stress events at various levels of severity.
These policies and plans are based on stress scenarios and
include potential funding strategies and communication and
notification procedures that we would implement in the event we
experienced stressed liquidity conditions. We periodically review
and test the contingency funding plans to validate efficacy and
assess readiness.
Our U.S. bank subsidiaries can access contingency funding
through the Federal Reserve Discount Window. Certain non-U.S.
subsidiaries have access to central bank facilities in the
jurisdictions in which they operate. While we do not rely on
these sources in our liquidity modeling, we maintain the
policies, procedures and governance processes that would
enable us to access these sources if necessary.
Credit Ratings
Our borrowing costs and ability to raise funds are impacted by
our credit ratings. In addition, credit ratings may be important to
customers or counterparties when we compete in certain
markets and when we seek to engage in certain transactions,
including over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives. Thus, it is our
objective to maintain high-quality credit ratings, and
management maintains an active dialogue with the major rating
agencies.
Credit ratings and outlooks are opinions expressed by rating
agencies on our creditworthiness and that of our obligations or
securities, including long-term debt, short-term borrowings,
preferred stock and other securities, including asset
securitizations. Our credit ratings are subject to ongoing review
96 Bank of America 2021

by the rating agencies, and they consider a number of factors,
including our own financial strength, performance, prospects
and operations as well as factors not under our control. The
rating agencies could make adjustments to our ratings at any
time, and they provide no assurances that they will maintain our
ratings at current levels.
Other factors that influence our credit ratings include
changes to the rating agencies9 methodologies for our industry
or certain security types; the rating agencies9 assessment of the
general operating environment for financial services companies;
our relative positions in the markets in which we compete; our
various risk exposures and risk management policies and
activities; pending litigation and other contingencies or potential
tail risks; our reputation; our liquidity position, diversity of
funding sources and funding costs; the current and expected
level and volatility of our earnings; our capital position and
capital management practices; our corporate governance; the
sovereign credit ratings of the U.S. government; current or future
regulatory and legislative initiatives; and the agencies9 views on
whether the U.S. government would provide meaningful support
to the Corporation or its subsidiaries in a crisis.

On May 24, 2021, Standard & Poor9s Global Ratings (S&P)
affirmed the current ratings of the Corporation and its
subsidiaries, while at the same time revising its rating outlook
to Positive from Stable.
On June 7, 2021, Fitch Ratings (Fitch) upgraded the long-
term senior debt ratings of the Corporation and its rated
subsidiaries by one notch, to AA- and AA, respectively. Fitch also
upgraded the Corporation9s short-term rating to F1+ which is
now aligned with the short-term rating of its subsidiaries,
including BANA. Following the upgrade, the rating outlook for the
Corporation and its subsidiaries is Stable.
On November 22, 2021, Moody9s Investors Service
(Moody9s) affirmed the current ratings of the Corporation and its
subsidiaries, while at the same time revising its rating outlook
to Positive from Stable.

A reduction in certain of our credit ratings or the ratings of
certain asset-backed securitizations may have a material
adverse effect on our liquidity, potential loss of access to credit
markets, the related cost of funds, our businesses and on
certain revenues, particularly in those businesses where
counterparty creditworthiness is critical. In addition, under the
terms of certain OTC derivative contracts and other trading
agreements, in the event of downgrades of our or our rated
subsidiaries9 credit ratings, the counterparties to those
agreements may require us to provide additional collateral, or to
terminate these contracts or agreements, which could cause us
to sustain losses and/or adversely impact our liquidity. If the
short-term credit ratings of our parent company, bank or broker-
dealer subsidiaries were downgraded by one or more levels, the
potential loss of access to short-term funding sources such as
repo financing and the effect on our incremental cost of funds
could be material.
While certain potential impacts are contractual and
quantifiable, the full scope of the consequences of a credit
rating downgrade to a financial institution is inherently
uncertain, as it depends upon numerous dynamic, complex and
inter-related factors and assumptions, including whether any
downgrade of a company9s long-term credit ratings precipitates
downgrades to its short-term credit ratings, and assumptions
about the potential behaviors of various customers, investors
and counterparties. For more information on potential impacts
of credit rating downgrades, see Liquidity Risk 3 Liquidity Stress
Analysis on page 95.
For more information on additional collateral and termination
payments that could be required in connection with certain OTC
derivative contracts and other trading agreements as a result of
such a credit rating downgrade, see Note 3 3 Derivatives to the
Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 1A. Risk Factors of

Finance Subsidiary Issuers and Parent Guarantor
BofA Finance LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (BofA
Finance), is a consolidated finance subsidiary of the Corporation
that has issued and sold, and is expected to continue to issue
and sell, its senior unsecured debt securities (Guaranteed
Notes) that are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the
Corporation. The Corporation guarantees the due and punctual
payment, on demand, of amounts payable on the Guaranteed
Notes if not paid by BofA Finance. In addition, each of BAC
Capital Trust XIII, BAC Capital Trust XIV and BAC Capital Trust
XV, Delaware statutory trusts (collectively, the Trusts), is a 100
percent owned finance subsidiary of the Corporation that has
issued and sold trust preferred securities (the Trust Preferred
Securities) or capital securities (the Capital Securities and,
together with the Guaranteed Notes and the Trust Preferred
Securities, the Guaranteed Securities), as applicable, that
remained outstanding at December 31, 2021. The Corporation
Bank of America 2021 97

guarantees the payment of amounts and distributions with
respect to the Trust Preferred Securities and Capital Securities
if not paid by the Trusts, to the extent of funds held by the
Trusts, and this guarantee, together with the Corporation9s other
obligations with respect to the Trust Preferred Securities and
Capital Securities, effectively constitutes a full and
unconditional guarantee of the Trusts9 payment obligations on
the Trust Preferred Securities or Capital Securities, as
applicable. No other subsidiary of the Corporation guarantees
the Guaranteed Securities.
BofA Finance and each of the Trusts are finance
subsidiaries, have no independent assets, revenues or
operations and are dependent upon the Corporation and/or the
Corporation9s other subsidiaries to meet their respective
obligations under the Guaranteed Securities in the ordinary
course. If holders of the Guaranteed Securities make claims on
their Guaranteed Securities in a bankruptcy, resolution or
similar proceeding, any recoveries on those claims will be
limited to those available under the applicable guarantee by the
Corporation, as described above.
The Corporation is a holding company and depends upon its
subsidiaries for liquidity. Applicable laws and regulations and
intercompany arrangements entered into in connection with the
Corporation9s resolution plan could restrict the availability of
funds from subsidiaries to the Corporation, which could
adversely affect the Corporation9s ability to make payments
under its guarantees. In addition, the obligations of the
Corporation under the guarantees of the Guaranteed Securities
will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future
liabilities of its subsidiaries, and claimants should look only to
assets of the Corporation for payments. If the Corporation, as
guarantor of the Guaranteed Notes, transfers all or substantially
all of its assets to one or more direct or indirect majority-owned
subsidiaries, under the indenture governing the Guaranteed
Notes, the subsidiary or subsidiaries will not be required to
assume the Corporation9s obligations under its guarantee of the
Guaranteed Notes.
For more information on factors that may affect payments to
holders of the Guaranteed Securities, see Liquidity Risk 3 NB

2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Part I. Item 1A. Risk

Representations and Warranties Obligations
For information on representations and warranties obligations in
connection with the sale of mortgage loans, see Note 12 3
Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Credit Risk Management
Credit risk is the risk of loss arising from the inability or failure
of a borrower or counterparty to meet its obligations. Credit risk
can also arise from operational failures that result in an
erroneous advance, commitment or investment of funds. We
define the credit exposure to a borrower or counterparty as the
loss potential arising from all product classifications including
loans and leases, deposit overdrafts, derivatives, assets held-
for-sale and unfunded lending commitments which include loan
commitments, letters of credit and financial guarantees.
Derivative positions are recorded at fair value and assets held-
for-sale are recorded at either fair value or the lower of cost or
fair value. Certain loans and unfunded commitments are
accounted for under the fair value option. Credit risk for
categories of assets carried at fair value is not accounted for as
part of the allowance for credit losses but as part of the fair

value adjustments recorded in earnings. For derivative positions,
our credit risk is measured as the net cost in the event the
counterparties with contracts in which we are in a gain position
fail to perform under the terms of those contracts. We use the
current fair value to represent credit exposure without giving
consideration to future mark-to-market changes. The credit risk
amounts take into consideration the effects of legally
enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral. Our
consumer and commercial credit extension and review
procedures encompass funded and unfunded credit exposures.
For more information on derivatives and credit extension
commitments, see Note 3 3 Derivatives and Note 12 3
Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.
We manage credit risk based on the risk profile of the
borrower or counterparty, repayment sources, the nature of
underlying collateral and other support given current events,
conditions and expectations. We classify our portfolios as either
consumer or commercial and monitor credit risk in each as
discussed below.
We refine our underwriting and credit risk management
practices as well as credit standards to meet the changing
economic environment. To mitigate losses and enhance
customer support in our consumer businesses, we have in
place collection programs and loan modification and customer
assistance infrastructures. We utilize a number of actions to
mitigate losses in the commercial businesses including
increasing the frequency and intensity of portfolio monitoring,
hedging activity and our practice of transferring management of
deteriorating commercial exposures to independent special
asset officers as credits enter criticized categories.
For information on our credit risk management activities, see
Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management below, Commercial
Portfolio Credit Risk Management on page 104, Non-U.S.
Portfolio on page 110, Allowance for Credit Losses on page
112, and Note 5 3 Outstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance
for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For
more information on the factors that may expose us to credit
risk, see Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors of our 2021 Annual
Report on Form 10-K.
During 2021, the economy gained momentum as
unemployment continued to decline from double-digit highs
during 2020 and the economy re-opened as vaccination rates
increased and restrictions eased. With the easing of
restrictions, we saw increased business openings, a rebound to
commercial and consumer spending, higher asset values and
increased global GDP, all of which positively impacted our
consumer and commercial credit portfolios. Additionally,
individuals and businesses in the U.S. benefited from various
forms of government support through economic stimulus
packages enacted in 2020 and 2021, which contributed to
strong asset quality across our credit portfolios.
As a result of the economic recovery experienced in 2021,
net charge-offs, nonperforming loans and commercial reservable
criticized exposure declined compared to 2020. While there
has been significant economic improvement in comparison to
2020, uncertainty remains about the timing and strength of the
economy9s recovery, which may also be hampered by supply
chain disruptions and inflationary pressures and could lead to
adverse impacts to credit quality metrics in future periods. The
pandemic and its full impact on the global economy continue to
be highly uncertain. While COVID-19 cases eased throughout the
majority of 2021, they reached new highs by the end of 2021,
and the spread of new, more contagious variants could impact
the magnitude and duration of this health crisis. However,
98 Bank of America 2021
ongoing virus containment efforts and vaccination progress,
could support the macroeconomic recovery.
For more information on how the pandemic may affect our
operations, see Executive Summary 3 Recent Developments 3
COVID-19 Pandemic on page 66 and Item 1A. Risk Factors of
our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management
Credit risk management for the consumer portfolio begins with
initial underwriting and continues throughout a borrower9s credit
cycle. Statistical techniques in conjunction with experiential
judgment are used in all aspects of portfolio management
including underwriting, product pricing, risk appetite, setting
credit limits, and establishing operating processes and metrics
to quantify and balance risks and returns. Statistical models are
built using detailed behavioral information from external sources
such as credit bureaus and/or internal historical experience and
are a component of our consumer credit risk management
process. These models are used in part to assist in making
both new and ongoing credit decisions, as well as portfolio
management strategies, including authorizations and line
management, collection practices and strategies, and
determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses and
allocated capital for credit risk.

Consumer Credit Portfolio
The economic environment improved during 2021, with the U.S.
unemployment rate continuing to decline and home prices
increasing. During 2021, net charge-offs decreased
$805 million to $1.8 billion primarily due to lower credit card
losses, as the impact of government stimulus measures were
partially offset by charge-offs associated with deferrals that
expired in 2020. During 2021, nonperforming loans increased
due to deferral activity.
The consumer allowance for loan and lease losses
decreased $3.0 billion in 2021 to $7.0 billion primarily due to
improvements in the macroeconomic outlook and credit quality.
For more information, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page
112.
For more information on our accounting policies regarding
delinquencies, nonperforming status, charge-offs and troubled
debt restructurings (TDRs) for the consumer portfolio, as well as
interest accrual policies and delinquency status for loan
modifications related to the pandemic, see Note 1 3 Summary of
Significant Accounting Principles and Note 5 3 Outstanding Loans

Financial Statements.

We believe that the presentation of information adjusted to
exclude the impact of the fully-insured loan portfolio and loans
accounted for under the fair value option is more representative
of the ongoing operations and credit quality of the business. As
a result, in the following tables and discussions of the
residential mortgage and home equity portfolios, we exclude
loans accounted for under the fair value option and provide
information that excludes the impact of the fully-insured loan
portfolio in certain credit quality statistics.

Residential Mortgage
The residential mortgage portfolio made up the largest
percentage of our consumer loan portfolio at 51 percent of
consumer loans and leases in 2021. Approximately 52 percent
of the residential mortgage portfolio was in Consumer Banking

and 43 percent was in GWIM. The remaining portion was in All
Other.
Outstanding balances in the residential mortgage portfolio
decreased $1.6 billion in 2021 as paydowns were partially
offset by originations.
At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the residential mortgage
portfolio included $12.7 billion and $11.8 billion of outstanding
fully-insured loans, of which $2.2 billion and $2.8 billion had
FHA insurance, with the remainder protected by Fannie Mae
long-term standby agreements.

Includes loans that are contractually current which primarily consist of collateral-dependent TDRs, including those that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy and loans that have not yet
demonstrated a sustained period of payment performance following a TDR.
Nonperforming outstanding balances in the residential
mortgage portfolio increased $279 million in 2021 primarily
driven by deferral activity. Of the nonperforming residential
mortgage loans at December 31, 2021, $1.2 billion, or 51
percent, were current on contractual payments. Loans accruing
past due 30 days or more decreased $358 million driven by
continued improvement in credit quality.
Net recoveries of $28 million in 2021 remained relatively
unchanged compared to 2020.
Of the $209.3 billion in total residential mortgage loans
outstanding at December 31, 2021, 27 percent were originated
as interest-only loans. The outstanding balance of interest-only
residential mortgage loans that have entered the amortization
period was $4.8 billion, or eight percent, at December 31,

Residential mortgage loans that have entered the
amortization period generally experienced a higher rate of early
stage delinquencies and nonperforming status compared to the
residential mortgage portfolio as a whole. At December 31,
2021, $66 million, or one percent, of outstanding interest-only
residential mortgages that had entered the amortization period
were accruing past due 30 days or more compared to $866
million, or less than one percent, for the entire residential
mortgage portfolio. In addition, at December 31, 2021, $275
million, or six percent, of outstanding interest-only residential
mortgage loans that had entered the amortization period were
nonperforming, of which $83 million were contractually current
compared to $2.3 billion, or one percent, for the entire
residential mortgage portfolio. Loans that have yet to enter the
amortization period in our interest-only residential mortgage
portfolio are primarily well-collateralized loans to our wealth
management clients and have an interest-only period of three to
ten years. Approximately 91 percent of these loans that have
yet to enter the amortization period will not be required to make
a fully-amortizing payment until 2025 or later.
Table 22 presents outstandings, nonperforming loans and
net charge-offs by certain state concentrations for the
residential mortgage portfolio. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-
Santa Ana Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) within California
represented 15 percent and 16 percent of outstandings at
December 31, 2021 and 2020. In the New York area, the New
York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island MSA made up 15 percent
and 14 percent of outstandings at December 31, 2021 and
2020.

Home Equity
At December 31, 2021, the home equity portfolio made up six
percent of the consumer portfolio and was comprised of home
equity lines of credit (HELOCs), home equity loans and reverse
mortgages. HELOCs generally have an initial draw period of 10
years, and after the initial draw period ends, the loans generally
convert to 15- or 20-year amortizing loans. We no longer
originate home equity loans or reverse mortgages.
At December 31, 2021, 80 percent of the home equity
portfolio was in Consumer Banking, 11 percent was in All Other
and the remainder of the portfolio was primarily in GWIM.
Outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio decreased
$6.4 billion in 2021 primarily due to paydowns outpacing new
originations and draws on existing lines. Of the total home
equity portfolio at December 31, 2021 and 2020, $12.2 billion,
or 44 percent, and $13.8 billion, or 40 percent, were in first-lien
positions. At December 31, 2021, outstanding balances in the
home equity portfolio that were in a second-lien or more junior-
lien position and where we also held the first-lien loan totaled
$4.6 billion, or 16 percent of our total home equity portfolio.
Unused HELOCs totaled $40.5 billion and $42.3 billion at
December 31, 2021 and 2020. The HELOC utilization rate was

Includes loans that are contractually current which primarily consist of collateral-dependent TDRs, including those that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy, junior-lien loans where the
underlying first lien is 90 days or more past due, as well as loans that have not yet demonstrated a sustained period of payment performance following a TDR.
Nonperforming outstanding balances in the home equity
portfolio remained relatively flat at $630 million at December
31, 2021. Of the nonperforming home equity loans at
December 31, 2021, $227 million, or 36 percent, were current
on contractual payments. In addition, $273 million, or 43
percent of nonperforming home equity loans were 180 days or
more past due and had been written down to the estimated fair
value of the collateral, less costs to sell. Accruing loans that
were 30 days or more past due decreased $29 million in 2021.
Net recoveries increased $46 million to $119 million in 2021
compared to the same period in 2020. The increase was driven
by favorable portfolio trends due in part to improvement in home
prices.
Of the $27.9 billion in total home equity portfolio
outstandings at December 31, 2021, as shown in Table 23, 14
percent require interest-only payments. The outstanding balance
of HELOCs that have reached the end of their draw period and
have entered the amortization period was $6.8 billion at
December 31, 2021. The HELOCs that have entered the
amortization period have experienced a higher percentage of
early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status when
compared to the HELOC portfolio as a whole. At December 31,
2021, $105 million, or two percent, of outstanding HELOCs that
had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30
days or more. In addition, at December 31, 2021, $455 million,
or seven percent, were nonperforming. Loans that have yet to
enter the amortization period in our interest-only portfolio are
primarily post-2008 vintages and generally have better credit
quality than the previous vintages that had entered the
amortization period. We communicate to contractually current
customers more than a year prior to the end of their draw period
to inform them of the potential change to the payment structure
before entering the amortization period, and provide payment
options to customers prior to the end of the draw period.
Although we do not actively track how many of our home
equity customers pay only the minimum amount due on their
home equity loans and lines, we can infer some of this
information through a review of our HELOC portfolio that we
service and that is still in its revolving period. During 2021, nine
percent of these customers with an outstanding balance did not
pay any principal on their HELOCs.

Credit Card
At December 31, 2021, 97 percent of the credit card portfolio
was managed in Consumer Banking with the remainder in GWIM.
Outstandings in the credit card portfolio increased $2.7 billion
in 2021 to $81.4 billion due to higher retail spend. Net charge-
offs decreased $626 million to $1.7 billion during 2021
compared to the same period in 2020 due to the impact of
government stimulus measures, partially offset by charge-offs of
certain loans with deferrals that expired in 2020. Credit card
loans 30 days or more past due and still accruing interest
decreased $692 million, and loans 90 days or more past due
and still accruing interest decreased $416 million primarily due
to charge-offs of certain loans with deferrals that expired in
2020 and the impact of government stimulus measures.
Unused lines of credit for credit card increased to $361.2
billion at December 31, 2021 from $342.4 billion at 2020.

In addition to modifying consumer real estate loans, we work
with customers who are experiencing financial difficulty by
modifying credit card and other consumer loans. Credit card and
other consumer loan modifications generally involve a reduction
in the customer9s interest rate on the account and placing the
customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months.
Modifications of credit card and other consumer loans are
made through programs utilizing direct customer contact, but
may also utilize external programs. At December 31, 2021 and
2020, our credit card and other consumer TDR portfolio was
$672 million and $701 million, of which $599 million and $614
million were current or less than 30 days past due under the
modified terms.
Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management
Credit risk management for the commercial portfolio begins with
an assessment of the credit risk profile of the borrower or
counterparty based on an analysis of its financial position. As
part of the overall credit risk assessment, our commercial credit
exposures are assigned a risk rating and are subject to approval
based on defined credit approval standards. Subsequent to loan
origination, risk ratings are monitored on an ongoing basis, and
if necessary, adjusted to reflect changes in the financial
condition, cash flow, risk profile or outlook of a borrower or
counterparty. In making credit decisions, we consider risk rating,
collateral, country, industry and single-name concentration limits
while also balancing these considerations with the total
borrower or counterparty relationship. We use a variety of tools
to continuously monitor the ability of a borrower or counterparty
to perform under its obligations. We use risk rating aggregations
to measure and evaluate concentrations within portfolios. In
addition, risk ratings are a factor in determining the level of
allocated capital and the allowance for credit losses.
As part of our ongoing risk mitigation initiatives, we attempt
to work with clients experiencing financial difficulty to modify
their loans to terms that better align with their current ability to
pay. In situations where an economic concession has been
granted to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty, we identify
these loans as TDRs. For more information on our accounting
policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status and net
charge-offs for the commercial portfolio, see Note 1 3 Summary
of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial
Statements_._
Management of Commercial Credit Risk
Concentrations
Commercial credit risk is evaluated and managed with the goal
that concentrations of credit exposure continue to be aligned
with our risk appetite. We review, measure and manage
concentrations of credit exposure by industry, product,
geography, customer relationship and loan size. We also review,
measure and manage commercial real estate loans by
geographic location and property type. In addition, within our
non-U.S. portfolio, we evaluate exposures by region and by
country. Tables 33, 36 and 39 summarize our concentrations.
We also utilize syndications of exposure to third parties, loan
sales, hedging and other risk mitigation techniques to manage
the size and risk profile of the commercial credit portfolio. For
more information on our industry concentrations, see
Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management 3 Industry
Concentrations on page 108 and Table 36.
We account for certain large corporate loans and loan
commitments, including issued but unfunded letters of credit
which are considered utilized for credit risk management
purposes, that exceed our single-name credit risk concentration
guidelines under the fair value option. Lending commitments,
both funded and unfunded, are actively managed and
monitored, and as appropriate, credit risk for these lending
relationships may be mitigated through the use of credit
derivatives, with our credit view and market perspectives
determining the size and timing of the hedging activity. In
addition, we purchase credit protection to cover the funded
portion as well as the unfunded portion of certain other credit
exposures. To lessen the cost of obtaining our desired credit
protection levels, credit exposure may be added within an
industry, borrower or counterparty group by selling protection.
These credit derivatives do not meet the requirements for
treatment as accounting hedges. They are carried at fair value
with changes in fair value recorded in other income.
In addition, we are a member of various securities and
derivative exchanges and clearinghouses, both in the U.S. and
other countries. As a member, we may be required to pay a pro-
rata share of the losses incurred by some of these
organizations as a result of another member default and under
other loss scenarios. For more information, see Note 12 3
Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.
Commercial Credit Portfolio
During 2021, commercial credit quality improved as the
economic recovery gained momentum driven in part by
increased consumer spending and COVID-19 vaccination
progress. Accordingly, charge-offs, nonperforming commercial
loans and reservable criticized utilized exposure declined during
this period. Outstanding commercial loans and leases increased
$44.4 billion during 2021 due to growth in commercial and
industrial, primarily in Global Markets with most of the increase
in investment grade exposures. This increase was partially
offset by lower U.S. small business commercial loans due to
repayments of PPP loans by the Small Business Administration
(SBA) under the terms of the program. For more information on
104 Bank of America 2021

PPP loans, see Note 1 3 Summary of Significant Accounting
Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Credit quality of commercial real estate borrowers has begun
to stabilize in many sectors as economies have reopened.
However, certain sectors, including hospitality, while showing
signs of improvement, continue to be negatively impacted due
to the pandemic. Moreover, many real estate markets, while
improving, are still experiencing some disruptions in demand,
supply chain challenges and tenant difficulties. Current and
future office demand is uncertain as companies evaluate space
needs with employment models that utilize a mix of remote and
conventional office use.
The commercial allowance for loan and lease losses
decreased $3.4 billion during 2021 to $5.4 billion driven by
improvements in the macroeconomic outlook and credit quality.
For more information, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page

Total commercial utilized credit exposure increased $33.2
billion during 2021 to $653.5 billion primarily driven by higher
loans and leases. The utilization rate for loans and leases,
standby letters of credit (SBLCs) and financial guarantees, and
commercial letters of credit, in the aggregate, was 56 percent at
December 31, 2021 and 57 percent at December 31, 2020.
Table 29 presents commercial credit exposure by type for
utilized, unfunded and total binding committed credit exposure.
Commercial utilized credit exposure includes SBLCs and
financial guarantees and commercial letters of credit that have
been issued and for which we are legally bound to advance
funds under prescribed conditions during a specified time
period, and excludes exposure related to trading account
assets. Although funds have not yet been advanced, these
exposure types are considered utilized for credit risk
management purposes.

commercial loans increased $37.2 billion, or 13 percent, during
2021 primarily driven by Global Markets and Global Banking.
Reservable criticized utilized exposure decreased $10.1 billion,
driven by decreases across a broad range of industries.
Non-U.S. Commercial
At December 31, 2021, 69 percent of the non-U.S. commercial
loan portfolio was managed in Global Banking, 30 percent in
Global Markets and the remainder in GWIM. Non-U.S.
commercial loans increased $22.8 billion, or 25 percent, during
2021 primarily in Global Markets. Reservable criticized utilized
exposure decreased $2.5 billion, which was broad-based across
industries. For information on the non-U.S. commercial portfolio,
see Non-U.S. Portfolio on page 110.
Commercial Real Estate
Commercial real estate primarily includes commercial loans
secured by non-owner-occupied real estate and is dependent on
the sale or lease of the real estate as the primary source of
repayment. Outstanding loans increased $2.6 billion, or four
percent, during 2021 to $63.0 billion due to new originations
outpacing paydowns. The portfolio remains diversified across
property types and geographic regions. California represented
the largest state concentration at 21 percent and 23 percent of
the commercial real estate portfolio at December 31, 2021 and

The commercial real estate portfolio is predominantly
managed in Global Banking and consists of loans made
primarily to public and private developers, and commercial real
estate firms.
During 2021, we continued to see low default rates and
varying degrees of improvement in certain geographic regions
and property types of the portfolio. We use a number of
proactive risk mitigation initiatives to reduce adversely rated
exposure in the commercial real estate portfolio, including
transfers of deteriorating exposures for management by
independent special asset officers and the pursuit of loan
restructurings or asset sales to achieve the best results for our
customers and the Corporation.

U.S. Small Business Commercial
The U.S. small business commercial loan portfolio is comprised
of small business card loans and small business loans primarily
managed in Consumer Banking, and includes $4.7 billion and
$22.7 billion of PPP loans outstanding at December 31, 2021
and 2020. The decline of $18.0 billion in PPP loans during
2021 was due to repayment of the loans by the SBA under the
terms of the program. Excluding PPP, credit card-related
products were 50 percent of the U.S. small business
commercial portfolio at both December 31, 2021 and 2020 and
represented 95 percent of net charge-offs in 2021 compared to
91 percent in 2020.
Nonperforming Commercial Loans, Leases and Foreclosed
Properties Activity
Table 34 presents the nonperforming commercial loans, leases
and foreclosed properties activity during 2021 and 2020.
Nonperforming loans do not include loans accounted for under
the fair value option. During 2021, nonperforming commercial
loans and leases decreased $649 million to $1.6 billion. At
December 31, 2021, 88 percent of commercial nonperforming
loans, leases and foreclosed properties were secured and 54
percent were contractually current. Commercial nonperforming
loans were carried at 90 percent of their unpaid principal
balance, as the carrying value of these loans has been reduced
to the estimated collateral value less costs to sell.

Industry Concentrations
Table 36 presents commercial committed and utilized credit
exposure by industry. Our commercial credit exposure is
diversified across a broad range of industries. Total commercial
committed exposure increased $89.6 billion, or nine percent,
during 2021 to $1.1 trillion. The increase in commercial
committed exposure was concentrated in the Asset managers
and funds, Finance companies and Utilities industry sectors.
Increases were partially offset by decreased exposure to the
Government and public education and Automobiles and
components industry sectors.
Industry limits are used internally to manage industry
concentrations and are based on committed exposure that is
determined on an industry-by-industry basis. A risk management
framework is in place to set and approve industry limits as well
as to provide ongoing monitoring.
Asset managers and funds, our largest industry
concentration with committed exposure of $136.9 billion,
increased $36.6 billion, or 37 percent, during 2021, which was
primarily driven by secured investment grade exposures.

Real estate, our second largest industry concentration with
committed exposure of $96.2 billion, increased $4.5 billion, or
five percent, during 2021. For more information on the
commercial real estate and related portfolios, see Commercial
Portfolio Credit Risk Management 3 Commercial Real Estate on
page 106.
Finance companies, our third largest industry concentration
with committed exposure of $86.0 billion, increased $16.0
billion, or 23 percent during 2021, with the growth largely
occurring in Consumer Finance, Thrifts and Mortgage Finance
and Diversified Financials.
Given the widespread impact of the pandemic on the U.S.
and global economy, a number of industries have been and will
likely continue to be adversely impacted. We continue to monitor
all industries, particularly higher risk industries that are
experiencing or could experience a more significant impact to
their financial condition.

Industries are viewed from a variety of perspectives to best isolate the perceived risks. For purposes of this table, the real estate industry is defined based on the primary business activity of the
borrowers or counterparties using operating cash flows and primary source of repayment as key factors.
Risk Mitigation
We purchase credit protection to cover the funded portion as
well as the unfunded portion of certain credit exposures. To
lower the cost of obtaining our desired credit protection levels,
we may add credit exposure within an industry, borrower or
counterparty group by selling protection.
At December 31, 2021 and 2020, net notional credit default
protection purchased in our credit derivatives portfolio to hedge
our funded and unfunded exposures for which we elected the
fair value option, as well as certain other credit exposures, was
$2.6 billion and $4.2 billion. We recorded net losses of $91
million in 2021 compared to net losses of $240 million in

The gains and losses on these instruments were offset
by gains and losses on the related exposures. The Value-at-
Risk (VaR) results for these exposures are included in the fair
value option portfolio information in Table 43. For more
information, see Trading Risk Management on page 115.
Tables 37 and 38 present the maturity profiles and the

In addition to our net notional credit default protection
purchased to cover the funded and unfunded portion of certain
credit exposures, credit derivatives are used for market-making
activities for clients and establishing positions intended to profit
from directional or relative value changes. We execute the
majority of our credit derivative trades in the OTC market with
large, multinational financial institutions, including broker-
dealers and, to a lesser degree, with a variety of other
investors. Because these transactions are executed in the OTC
market, we are subject to settlement risk. We are also subject
to credit risk in the event that these counterparties fail to
perform under the terms of these contracts. In order to properly
reflect counterparty credit risk, we record counterparty credit risk
valuation adjustments on certain derivative assets, including our
purchased credit default protection. In most cases, credit
derivative transactions are executed on a daily margin basis.
Therefore, events such as a credit downgrade, depending on the
ultimate rating level, or a breach of credit covenants would
typically require an increase in the amount of collateral required
by the counterparty, where applicable, and/or allow us to take
additional protective measures such as early termination of all
trades. For more information on credit derivatives and
counterparty credit risk valuation adjustments, see Note 3 3
Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Non-U.S. Portfolio
Our non-U.S. credit and trading portfolios are subject to country
risk. We define country risk as the risk of loss from unfavorable
economic and political conditions, currency fluctuations, social
instability and changes in government policies. A risk
management framework is in place to measure, monitor and

manage non-U.S. risk and exposures. In addition to the direct
risk of doing business in a country, we also are exposed to
indirect country risks (e.g., related to the collateral received on
secured financing transactions or related to client clearing
activities). These indirect exposures are managed in the normal
course of business through credit, market and operational risk
governance rather than through country risk governance.
Table 39 presents our 20 largest non-U.S. country exposures
at December 31, 2021. These exposures accounted for 89
percent and 90 percent of our total non-U.S. exposure at
December 31, 2021 and 2020. Net country exposure for these
20 countries increased $10.5 billion in 2021 primarily driven by
increases in Australia, Canada and France, partially offset by
reductions in Germany and the United Kingdom.
Non-U.S. exposure is presented on an internal risk
management basis and includes sovereign and non-sovereign
credit exposure, securities and other investments issued by or
domiciled in countries other than the U.S.
Funded loans and loan equivalents include loans, leases,
and other extensions of credit and funds, including letters of
credit and due from placements. Unfunded commitments are
the undrawn portion of legally binding commitments related to
loans and loan equivalents. Net counterparty exposure includes
the fair value of derivatives, including the counterparty risk
associated with credit default swaps (CDS), and secured
financing transactions. Securities and other investments are
carried at fair value and long securities exposures are netted
against short exposures with the same underlying issuer to, but
not below, zero. Net country exposure represents country
exposure less hedges and credit default protection purchased,
net of credit default protection sold.

Our largest non-U.S. country exposure at December 31, 2021
was the United Kingdom with net exposure of $55.0 billion,
which represents a $4.5 billion decrease from December 31,

Our second largest non-U.S. country exposure was
Germany with net exposure of $33.8 billion at December 31,
2021, a $11.1 billion decrease from December 31, 2020. The
decrease in both of these countries was primarily driven by a
reduction in deposits with central banks.
In light of the global pandemic, we are monitoring our non-
U.S. exposure closely, particularly in countries where restrictions
on certain activities, in an attempt to contain the spread and
impact of the virus, have affected and will likely continue to
adversely affect economic activity.
The impact of COVID-19 could have an adverse impact on the
global economy for a prolonged period of time. For more

Market Risk Management
Market risk is the risk that changes in market conditions may
adversely impact the value of assets or liabilities, or otherwise
negatively impact earnings. This risk is inherent in the financial
instruments associated with our operations, primarily within our
Global Markets segment. We are also exposed to these risks in
other areas of the Corporation (e.g., our ALM activities). In the
event of market stress, these risks could have a material
impact on our results. For more information, see Interest Rate
Risk Management for the Banking Book on page 118.
We have been affected, and may continue to be affected, by
market stress resulting from the pandemic that began in the
first quarter of 2020. For more information, see Part 1. Item 1A.
Risk Factors of our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our traditional banking loan and deposit products are non-
trading positions and are generally reported at amortized cost
for assets or the amount owed for liabilities (historical cost).
However, these positions are still subject to changes in
economic value based on varying market conditions, with one of
the primary risks being changes in the levels of interest rates.
The risk of adverse changes in the economic value of our non-
trading positions arising from changes in interest rates is
managed through our ALM activities. We have elected to
account for certain assets and liabilities under the fair value
option.
Our trading positions are reported at fair value with changes
reflected in income. Trading positions are subject to various
changes in market-based risk factors. The majority of this risk is
generated by our activities in the interest rate, foreign exchange,
credit, equity and commodities markets. In addition, the values
of assets and liabilities could change due to market liquidity,
correlations across markets and expectations of market
volatility. We seek to manage these risk exposures by using a
variety of techniques that encompass a broad range of financial
instruments. The key risk management techniques are
discussed in more detail in the Trading Risk Management
section.
Global Risk Management is responsible for providing senior
management with a clear and comprehensive understanding of
the trading risks to which we are exposed. These
responsibilities include ownership of market risk policy,
developing and maintaining quantitative risk models, calculating
aggregated risk measures, establishing and monitoring position
limits consistent with risk appetite, conducting daily reviews and
analysis of trading inventory, approving material risk exposures
and fulfilling regulatory requirements. Market risks that impact
businesses outside of Global Markets are monitored and
governed by their respective governance functions.
Model risk is the potential for adverse consequences from
decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs and
reports. Given that models are used across the Corporation,
model risk impacts all risk types including credit, market and
operational risks. The Enterprise Model Risk Policy defines
model risk standards, consistent with our Risk Framework and
risk appetite, prevailing regulatory guidance and industry best
practice. All models, including risk management, valuation and
regulatory capital models, must meet certain validation criteria,
including effective challenge of the conceptual soundness of the
model, independent model testing and ongoing monitoring
through outcomes analysis and benchmarking. The Enterprise
Model Risk Committee (EMRC), a subcommittee of the MRC,
oversees that model standards are consistent with model risk
requirements and monitors the effective challenge in the model
validation process across the Corporation.

Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk represents exposures to instruments whose
values vary with the level or volatility of interest rates. These
instruments include, but are not limited to, loans, debt
securities, certain trading-related assets and liabilities,
deposits, borrowings and derivatives. Hedging instruments used
to mitigate these risks include derivatives such as options,
futures, forwards and swaps.
Foreign Exchange Risk
Foreign exchange risk represents exposures to changes in the
values of current holdings and future cash flows denominated in
currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The types of instruments
exposed to this risk include investments in non-U.S.
subsidiaries, foreign currency-denominated loans and securities,
future cash flows in foreign currencies arising from foreign
exchange transactions, foreign currency-denominated debt and
various foreign exchange derivatives whose values fluctuate with
changes in the level or volatility of currency exchange rates or
non-U.S. interest rates. Hedging instruments used to mitigate
this risk include foreign exchange options, currency swaps,
futures, forwards, and foreign currency-denominated debt and
deposits.
Mortgage Risk
Mortgage risk represents exposures to changes in the values of
mortgage-related instruments. The values of these instruments
are sensitive to prepayment rates, mortgage rates, agency debt
ratings, default, market liquidity, government participation and
interest rate volatility. Our exposure to these instruments takes
several forms. For example, we trade and engage in market-
making activities in a variety of mortgage securities including
whole loans, pass-through certificates, commercial mortgages
and collateralized mortgage obligations including collateralized
debt obligations using mortgages as underlying collateral. In
addition, we originate a variety of MBS, which involves the
accumulation of mortgage-related loans in anticipation of
eventual securitization, and we may hold positions in mortgage
securities and residential mortgage loans as part of the ALM
portfolio. We also record MSRs as part of our mortgage
origination activities. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this
risk include derivatives such as options, swaps, futures and
forwards as well as securities including MBS and U.S. Treasury
securities. For more information, see Mortgage Banking Risk
Management on page 119.
Equity Market Risk
Equity market risk represents exposures to securities that
represent an ownership interest in a corporation in the form of
domestic and foreign common stock or other equity-linked
instruments. Instruments that would lead to this exposure
include, but are not limited to, the following: common stock,
exchange-traded funds, American Depositary Receipts,
convertible bonds, listed equity options (puts and calls), OTC
equity options, equity total return swaps, equity index futures
and other equity derivative products. Hedging instruments used
to mitigate this risk include options, futures, swaps, convertible
bonds and cash positions.
Commodity Risk
Commodity risk represents exposures to instruments traded in
the petroleum, natural gas, power and metals markets. These
instruments consist primarily of futures, forwards, swaps and
options. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include
114 Bank of America 2021
options, futures and swaps in the same or similar commodity
product, as well as cash positions.

Issuer Credit Risk
Issuer credit risk represents exposures to changes in the
creditworthiness of individual issuers or groups of issuers. Our
portfolio is exposed to issuer credit risk where the value of an
asset may be adversely impacted by changes in the levels of
credit spreads, by credit migration or by defaults. Hedging
instruments used to mitigate this risk include bonds, CDS and
other credit fixed-income instruments.

Market Liquidity Risk
Market liquidity risk represents the risk that the level of
expected market activity changes dramatically and, in certain
cases, may even cease. This exposes us to the risk that we will
not be able to transact business and execute trades in an
orderly manner which may impact our results. This impact could
be further exacerbated if expected hedging or pricing
correlations are compromised by disproportionate demand or
lack of demand for certain instruments. We utilize various risk
mitigating techniques as discussed in more detail in Trading
Risk Management.

Trading Risk Management

To evaluate risks in our trading activities, we focus on the actual
and potential volatility of revenues generated by individual
positions as well as portfolios of positions. Various techniques
and procedures are utilized to enable the most complete
understanding of these risks. Quantitative measures of market
risk are evaluated on a daily basis from a single position to the
portfolio of the Corporation. These measures include
sensitivities of positions to various market risk factors, such as
the potential impact on revenue from a one basis point change
in interest rates, and statistical measures utilizing both actual
and hypothetical market moves, such as VaR and stress
testing. Periods of extreme market stress influence the
reliability of these techniques to varying degrees. Qualitative
evaluations of market risk utilize the suite of quantitative risk
measures while understanding each of their respective
limitations. Additionally, risk managers independently evaluate
the risk of the portfolios under the current market environment
and potential future environments.
VaR is a common statistic used to measure market risk as it
allows the aggregation of market risk factors, including the
effects of portfolio diversification. A VaR model simulates the
value of a portfolio under a range of scenarios in order to
generate a distribution of potential gains and losses. VaR
represents the loss a portfolio is not expected to exceed more
than a certain number of times per period, based on a specified
holding period, confidence level and window of historical data.
We use one VaR model consistently across the trading
portfolios and it uses a historical simulation approach based on
a three-year window of historical data. Our primary VaR statistic
is equivalent to a 99 percent confidence level, which means
that for a VaR with a one-day holding period, there should not be
losses in excess of VaR, on average, 99 out of 100 trading
days.
Within any VaR model, there are significant and numerous
assumptions that will differ from company to company. The
accuracy of a VaR model depends on the availability and quality
of historical data for each of the risk factors in the portfolio. A
VaR model may require additional modeling assumptions for
new products that do not have the necessary historical market
data or for less liquid positions for which accurate daily prices

are not consistently available. For positions with insufficient
historical data for the VaR calculation, the process for
establishing an appropriate proxy is based on fundamental and
statistical analysis of the new product or less liquid position.
This analysis identifies reasonable alternatives that replicate
both the expected volatility and correlation to other market risk
factors that the missing data would be expected to experience.
VaR may not be indicative of realized revenue volatility as
changes in market conditions or in the composition of the
portfolio can have a material impact on the results. In particular,
the historical data used for the VaR calculation might indicate
higher or lower levels of portfolio diversification than will be
experienced. In order for the VaR model to reflect current market
conditions, we update the historical data underlying our VaR
model on a weekly basis, or more frequently during periods of
market stress, and regularly review the assumptions underlying
the model. A minor portion of risks related to our trading
positions is not included in VaR. These risks are reviewed as
part of our ICAAP. For more information regarding ICAAP, see
Capital Management on page 88.
Global Risk Management continually reviews, evaluates and
enhances our VaR model so that it reflects the material risks in
our trading portfolio. Changes to the VaR model are reviewed
and approved prior to implementation and any material changes
are reported to management through the appropriate
management committees.
Trading limits on quantitative risk measures, including VaR,
are independently set by Global Markets Risk Management and
reviewed on a regular basis so that trading limits remain
relevant and within our overall risk appetite for market risks.
Trading limits are reviewed in the context of market liquidity,
volatility and strategic business priorities. Trading limits are set
at both a granular level to allow for extensive coverage of risks
as well as at aggregated portfolios to account for correlations
among risk factors. All trading limits are approved at least
annually. Approved trading limits are stored and tracked in a
centralized limits management system. Trading limit excesses
are communicated to management for review. Certain
quantitative market risk measures and corresponding limits
have been identified as critical in the Corporation9s Risk
Appetite Statement. These risk appetite limits are reported on a
daily basis and are approved at least annually by the ERC and
the Board.
In periods of market stress, Global Markets senior leadership
communicates daily to discuss losses, key risk positions and
any limit excesses. As a result of this process, the businesses
may selectively reduce risk.
Table 43 presents the total market-based portfolio VaR,
which is the combination of the total covered positions (and
less liquid trading positions) portfolio and the fair value option
portfolio. Covered positions are defined by regulatory standards
as trading assets and liabilities, both on- and off-balance sheet,
that meet a defined set of specifications. These specifications
identify the most liquid trading positions which are intended to
be held for a short-term horizon and where we are able to hedge
the material risk elements in a two-way market. Positions in less
liquid markets, or where there are restrictions on the ability to
trade the positions, typically do not qualify as covered positions.
Foreign exchange and commodity positions are always
considered covered positions, except for structural foreign
currency positions that are excluded with prior regulatory
approval.
Bank of America 2021 115
In addition, Table 43 presents our fair value option portfolio,
which includes substantially all of the funded and unfunded
exposures for which we elect the fair value option, and their
corresponding hedges. Additionally, market risk VaR for trading
activities as presented in Table 43 differs from VaR used for
regulatory capital calculations due to the holding period being
used. The holding period for VaR used for regulatory capital
calculations is 10 days, while for the market risk VaR presented
below, it is one day. Both measures utilize the same process
and methodology.
The total market-based portfolio VaR results in Table 43
include market risk to which we are exposed from all business
segments, excluding credit valuation adjustment (CVA), DVA and
related hedges. The majority of this portfolio is within the Global
Markets segment.

Table 43 presents year-end, average, high and low daily
trading VaR for 2021 and 2020 using a 99 percent confidence
level. The amounts disclosed in Table 43 and Table 44 align to
the view of covered positions used in the Basel 3 capital
calculations. Foreign exchange and commodity positions are
always considered covered positions, regardless of trading or
banking treatment for the trade, except for structural foreign
currency positions that are excluded with prior regulatory
approval.
The annual average of total covered positions and less liquid
trading positions portfolio VaR decreased for 2021 compared to
2020 primarily due to an increase in diversification across asset
classes.

Backtesting
The accuracy of the VaR methodology is evaluated by
backtesting, which compares the daily VaR results, utilizing a
one-day holding period, against a comparable subset of trading
revenue. A backtesting excess occurs when a trading loss
exceeds the VaR for the corresponding day. These excesses are
evaluated to understand the positions and market moves that
produced the trading loss with a goal to ensure that the VaR
methodology accurately represents those losses. We expect the
frequency of trading losses in excess of VaR to be in line with
the confidence level of the VaR statistic being tested. For
example, with a 99 percent confidence level, we expect one
trading loss in excess of VaR every 100 days or between two to
three trading losses in excess of VaR over the course of a year.
The number of backtesting excesses observed can differ from
the statistically expected number of excesses if the current level
of market volatility is materially different than the level of
market volatility that existed during the three years of historical
data used in the VaR calculation.
The trading revenue used for backtesting is defined by
regulatory agencies in order to most closely align with the VaR
component of the regulatory capital calculation. This revenue
differs from total trading-related revenue in that it excludes
revenue from trading activities that either do not generate
market risk or the market risk cannot be included in VaR. Some
examples of the types of revenue excluded for backtesting are
fees, commissions, reserves, net interest income and intra-day
trading revenues.
We conduct daily backtesting on the VaR results used for
regulatory capital calculations as well as the VaR results for key
legal entities, regions and risk factors. These results are
reported to senior market risk management. Senior
management regularly reviews and evaluates the results of
these tests.
During 2021, there were two days where this subset of
trading revenue had losses that exceeded our total covered
portfolio VaR, utilizing a one-day holding period.

Total Trading-related Revenue
Total trading-related revenue, excluding brokerage fees, and
CVA, DVA and funding valuation adjustment gains (losses),
represents the total amount earned from trading positions,
including market-based net interest income, which are taken in
a diverse range of financial instruments and markets. For more
information on fair value, see Note 20 3 Fair Value
Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Trading-related revenue can be volatile and is largely driven by
general market conditions and customer demand. Also, trading-
related revenue is dependent on the volume and type of
transactions, the level of risk assumed, and the volatility of
price and rate movements at any given time within the ever-
changing market environment. Significant daily revenue by
business is monitored and the primary drivers of these are
reviewed.
The following histogram is a graphic depiction of trading
volatility and illustrates the daily level of trading-related revenue
for 2021 and 2020. During 2021, positive trading-related
revenue was recorded for 97 percent of the trading days, of
which 80 percent were daily trading gains of over $25
million, and the largest loss was $45 million. This compares to
2020 where positive trading-related revenue was recorded for
98 percent of the trading days, of which 87 percent were
daily trading gains of over $25 million, and the largest loss was
$90 million.

Trading Portfolio Stress Testing
Because the very nature of a VaR model suggests results can
exceed our estimates and it is dependent on a limited historical
window, we also stress test our portfolio using scenario
analysis. This analysis estimates the change in the value of our
trading portfolio that may result from abnormal market
movements.
A set of scenarios, categorized as either historical or
hypothetical, are computed daily for the overall trading portfolio
and individual businesses. These scenarios include shocks to
underlying market risk factors that may be well beyond the
shocks found in the historical data used to calculate VaR.
Historical scenarios simulate the impact of the market moves
that occurred during a period of extended historical market
stress. Generally, a multi-week period representing the most
severe point during a crisis is selected for each historical
scenario. Hypothetical scenarios provide estimated portfolio
impacts from potential future market stress events. Scenarios
are reviewed and updated in response to changing positions
and new economic or political information. In addition, new or
ad hoc scenarios are developed to address specific potential
market events or particular vulnerabilities in the portfolio. The
stress tests are reviewed on a regular basis and the results are
presented to senior management.
Stress testing for the trading portfolio is integrated with
enterprise-wide stress testing and incorporated into the limits
framework. The macroeconomic scenarios used for enterprise-
wide stress testing purposes differ from the typical trading
portfolio scenarios in that they have a longer time horizon and
the results are forecasted over multiple periods for use in
consolidated capital and liquidity planning. For more
information, see Managing Risk on page 85.
Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking
Book
The following discussion presents net interest income for
banking book activities.
Interest rate risk represents the most significant market risk
exposure to our banking book balance sheet. Interest rate risk
is measured as the potential change in net interest income
caused by movements in market interest rates. Client-facing
activities, primarily lending and deposit-taking, create interest
rate sensitive positions on our balance sheet.
We prepare forward-looking forecasts of net interest income.
The baseline forecast takes into consideration expected future
business growth, ALM positioning -and the direction of interest
rate movements as implied by the market-based forward curve.
We then measure and evaluate the impact that alternative
interest rate scenarios have on the baseline forecast in order to
assess interest rate sensitivity under varied conditions. The net
interest income forecast is frequently updated for changing
assumptions and differing outlooks based on economic trends,
market conditions and business strategies. Thus, we continually
monitor our balance sheet position in order to maintain an
acceptable level of exposure to interest rate changes.
The interest rate scenarios that we analyze incorporate
balance sheet assumptions such as loan and deposit growth
and pricing, changes in funding mix, product repricing, maturity
characteristics and investment securities premium amortization.
Our overall goal is to manage interest rate risk so that
movements in interest rates do not significantly adversely affect
earnings and capital.
Table 45 presents the spot and 12-month forward rates used
in our baseline forecasts at December 31, 2021 and 2020.

Table 46 shows the pretax impact to forecasted net interest
income over the next 12 months from December 31, 2021 and
2020 resulting from instantaneous parallel and non-parallel
shocks to the market-based forward curve. Periodically, we
evaluate the scenarios presented so that they are meaningful in
the context of the current rate environment. The interest rate
scenarios also assume U.S. dollar rates are floored at zero.
During 2021, the overall decrease in asset sensitivity of our
balance sheet to Up-rate and Down-rate scenarios was primarily
due to ALM activity and an increase in long-end rates. We
continue to be asset sensitive to a parallel upward move in
interest rates with the majority of that impact coming from the
short end of the yield curve. Additionally, higher interest rates
impact the fair value of debt securities and, accordingly, for debt
securities classified as AFS, may adversely affect accumulated
OCI and thus capital levels under the Basel 3 capital rules.
Under instantaneous upward parallel shifts, the near-term
adverse impact to Basel 3 capital is reduced over time by
offsetting positive impacts to net interest income. For more
information on Basel 3, see Capital Management 3 Regulatory
Capital on page 89.

The sensitivity analysis in Table 46 assumes that we take no
action in response to these rate shocks and does not assume
any change in other macroeconomic variables normally
correlated with changes in interest rates. As part of our ALM
activities, we use securities, certain residential mortgages, and
interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives in managing
interest rate sensitivity.
The behavior of our deposits portfolio in the baseline
forecast and in alternate interest rate scenarios is a key
assumption in our projected estimates of net interest income.
The sensitivity analysis in Table 46 assumes no change in
118 Bank of America 2021

deposit portfolio size or mix from the baseline forecast in
alternate rate environments. In higher rate scenarios, any
customer activity resulting in the replacement of low-cost or
noninterest-bearing deposits with higher yielding deposits or
market-based funding would reduce our benefit in those
scenarios.

Interest Rate and Foreign Exchange Derivative

Contracts
We use interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts
in our ALM activities to manage our interest rate and foreign
exchange risks. Specifically, we use those derivatives to
manage both the variability in cash flows and changes in fair
value of various assets and liabilities arising from those risks.
Our interest rate derivative contracts are generally non-leveraged
swaps tied to various benchmark interest rates and foreign
exchange basis swaps, options, futures and forwards, and our
foreign exchange contracts include cross-currency interest rate
swaps, foreign currency futures contracts, foreign currency
forward contracts and options.
The derivatives used in our ALM activities can be split into
two broad categories: designated accounting hedges and other
risk management derivatives. Designated accounting hedges
are primarily used to manage our exposure to interest rates as
described in the Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking
Book section and are included in the sensitivities presented in
Table 46. The Corporation also uses foreign currency derivatives
in accounting hedges to manage substantially all of the foreign
exchange risk of our foreign operations. By hedging the foreign
exchange risk of our foreign operations, the Corporation's
market risk exposure in this area is insignificant.
Risk management derivatives are predominantly used to
hedge foreign exchange risks related to various foreign currency-
denominated assets and liabilities and eliminate substantially
all foreign currency exposures in the cash flows of the
Corporation9s non-trading foreign currency-denominated financial
instruments. These foreign exchange derivatives are sensitive to
other market risk exposures such as cross-currency basis
spreads and interest rate risk. However, as these features are
not a significant component of these foreign exchange
derivatives, the market risk related to this exposure is
insignificant. For more information on the accounting for
derivatives, see Note 3 3 Derivatives to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Mortgage Banking Risk Management
We originate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subject us
to credit, liquidity and interest rate risks, among others. We
determine whether loans will be held for investment or held for
sale at the time of commitment and manage credit and liquidity
risks by selling or securitizing a portion of the loans we
originate.
Interest rate risk and market risk can be substantial in the
mortgage business. Changes in interest rates and other market
factors impact the volume of mortgage originations. Changes in
interest rates also impact the value of interest rate lock
commitments (IRLCs) and the related residential first mortgage
LHFS between the date of the IRLC and the date the loans are

sold to the secondary market. An increase in mortgage interest
rates typically leads to a decrease in the value of these
instruments. Conversely, when there is an increase in interest
rates, the value of the MSRs will increase driven by lower
prepayment expectations. Because the interest rate risks of
these hedged items offset, we combine them into one overall
hedged item with one combined economic hedge portfolio
consisting of derivative contracts and securities.
During 2021, 2020 and 2019, we recorded gains of $39
million, $321 million and $291 million. For more information on
MSRs, see Note 20 3 Fair Value Measurements to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.
Compliance and Operational Risk Management
Compliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions,
material financial loss or damage to the reputation of the
Corporation arising from the failure of the Corporation to comply
with the requirements of applicable laws, rules, regulations and
our internal policies and procedures (collectively, applicable
laws, rules and regulations). We are subject to comprehensive
regulation under federal and state laws, rules and regulations in
the U.S. and the laws of the various jurisdictions in which we
operate, including those related to financial crimes and anti-
money laundering, market conduct, trading activities, fair
lending, privacy, data protection and unfair, deceptive or abusive
acts or practices.
Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate
or failed processes or systems, people or external events, and
includes legal risk. Operational risk may occur anywhere in the
Corporation, including third-party business processes, and is not
limited to operations functions. The Corporation faces a number
of key operational risks including third-party risk, model risk,
conduct risk, technology risk, information security risk and data
risk. Operational risk can result in financial losses and
reputational impacts and is a component in the calculation of
total RWA used in the Basel 3 capital calculation. For more
information on Basel 3 calculations, see Capital Management
on page 88.
FLUs and control functions are first and foremost
responsible for managing all aspects of their businesses,
including their compliance and operational risk. FLUs and
control functions are required to understand their business
processes and related risks and controls, including third-party
dependencies and the related regulatory requirements, and
monitor and report on the effectiveness of the control
environment. In order to actively monitor and assess the
performance of their processes and controls, they must conduct
comprehensive quality assurance activities and identify issues
and risks to remediate control gaps and weaknesses. FLUs and
control functions must also adhere to compliance and
operational risk appetite limits to meet strategic, capital and
financial planning objectives. Finally, FLUs and control functions
are responsible for the proactive identification, management
and escalation of compliance and operational risks across the
Corporation. Collectively, these efforts are important to
strengthen their compliance and operational resiliency, which is
the ability to deliver critical operations through disruption.
Bank of America 2021 119
Global Compliance and Operational Risk teams
independently assess compliance and operational risk, monitor
business activities and processes and evaluate FLUs and
control functions for adherence to applicable laws, rules and
regulations, including identifying issues and risks, determining
and developing tests to be conducted by the Enterprise
Independent Testing unit and reporting on the state of the
control environment. Enterprise Independent Testing, an
independent testing function within GRM, works with Global
Compliance and Operational Risk, the FLUs and control
functions in the identification of testing needs and test design,
and is accountable for test execution, reporting and analysis of
results. Corporate Audit provides an independent assessment
and validation through testing of key compliance and operational
risk processes and controls across the Corporation.
The Corporation's Global Compliance Enterprise Policy and
Operational Risk Management 3 Enterprise Policy set the
requirements for reporting compliance and operational risk
information to executive management as well as the Board or
appropriate Board-level committees and reflect Global
Compliance and Operational Risk9s responsibilities for
conducting independent oversight of the Corporation9s
compliance and operational risk management activities. The
Board provides oversight of compliance risk through its Audit
Committee and the ERC, and operational risk through its ERC.
A key operational risk facing the Corporation is information
security, which includes cybersecurity. Cybersecurity risk
represents, among other things, exposure to failures or
interruptions of service or breaches of security, including as a
result of malicious technological attacks, that impact the
confidentiality, availability or integrity of our or third parties'
operations, systems or data. The Corporation seeks to mitigate
information security risk and associated reputational and
compliance risk by employing a multi-layered and intelligence-led
Global Information Security Program, which is focused on
preparing for, preventing, detecting, mitigating, responding to
and recovering from cyber threats and incidents and ensuring
the Corporation9s processes operate effectively and mitigate the
aforementioned risks.
The Global Information Security Program is supported by
three lines of defense. The Global Information Security Team
within the first line of defense is responsible for the day-to-day
management of the Global Information Security Program, which
includes defining policies and procedures to safeguard the
Corporation9s information systems and data, conducting
vulnerability and third-party information security assessments,
information security event management (e.g., responding to
ransomware and distributed denial of service attacks),
evaluation of external cyber intelligence, supporting industry
cybersecurity efforts and working with governmental agencies,
as well as developing employee training to support adherence to
the Corporation9s policies and procedures. As the second line of
defense, Global Compliance and Operational Risk independently
assesses, monitors and tests information security risk across
the Corporation as well as the effectiveness of the Global
Information Security Program. Corporate Audit serves as the
third line of defense, conducting additional independent review
and validation of the first line processes and functions.

Through established governance structures, we have
processes to help facilitate appropriate and effective oversight
of information security risk. These routines enable our three
lines of defense and management to debate information
security risks and monitor control performance to allow for
further escalation to executive management, management and
Board-level committees or to the Board, as appropriate. The
Board is actively engaged in the oversight of Bank of America9s
Global Information Security Program, primarily through the ERC.
Reputational Risk Management
Reputational risk is the risk that negative perception of the
Corporation may adversely impact profitability or operations.
Reputational risk may result from many of the Corporation9s
activities, including those related to the management of our
strategic, operational, compliance and credit risks.
The Corporation manages reputational risk through
established policies and controls embedded throughout its
business and risk management processes. We proactively
monitor and identify potential reputational risk events and have
processes established to mitigate reputational risks in a timely
manner. If reputational risk events occur, we focus on
remediating the underlying issue and taking action to minimize
damage to the Corporation9s reputation. The Corporation has
processes and procedures in place to respond to events that
give rise to reputational risk, including educating individuals and
organizations that influence public opinion, implementing
external communication strategies to mitigate the risk, and
informing key stakeholders of potential reputational risks. The
Corporation9s organization and governance structure provides
oversight of reputational risks. Reputational risk reporting is
provided regularly and directly to management and the ERC,
which provides primary oversight of reputational risk. In addition,
each FLU has a committee, which includes representatives from
Legal and Risk, that is responsible for the oversight of
reputational risk, including approval for business activities that
present elevated levels of reputational risks.
Climate Risk Management
Climate-related risks are divided into two major categories: (1)
risks related to the transition to a low-carbon economy, which
may entail extensive policy, legal, technology and market
changes, and (2) risks related to the physical impacts of climate
change, driven by extreme weather events, such as hurricanes
and floods, as well as chronic longer-term shifts, such as rising
average global temperatures and sea-level rise. These changes
and events can have broad impacts on operations, supply
chains, distribution networks, customers and markets and are
otherwise referred to, respectively, as transition risk and
physical risk. These risks can impact both financial and
nonfinancial risk types. The impacts of transition risk can lead
to and amplify credit risk or market risk by reducing our
customers9 operating income or the value of their assets as well
as expose us to reputational and/or litigation risk due to
increased regulatory scrutiny or negative public sentiment.
Physical risk can lead to increased credit risk by diminishing
borrowers9 repayment capacity or impacting the value of
collateral. In addition, it could pose increased operational risk to
our facilities and people.
120 Bank of America 2021
Effective management of climate risk requires coordinated
governance, clearly defined roles and responsibilities and well-
developed processes to identify, measure, monitor and control
risks. We continue to build out and enhance our climate risk
management capabilities. As climate risk is interconnected with
all key risk types, we have developed and continue to enhance
processes to embed climate risk considerations into our Risk
Framework and risk management programs established for
strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and
reputational risks. Our Environmental and Social Risk Policy
Framework (ESRPF) aligns with our Risk Framework and provides
additional clarity and transparency regarding our approach to
environmental and social risks, inclusive of climate risk.
Our governance framework establishes oversight of climate
risk practices and strategies by the Board, supported by its
Corporate Governance, ESG, and Sustainability Committee and
ERC, as well as the MRC and the Global ESG Committee, both
of which are management-level committees comprised of senior
leaders across every major FLU and control function.
Our climate risk management efforts are overseen by the
Global Climate Risk Executive who reports to the CRO. The
Global Climate Risk Executive chairs the Climate Risk Steering
Council, which meets monthly and shapes our approach to
managing climate-related risks in line with our Risk Framework.
As outlined in our ESRPF, we are focused on supporting and
financing areas critical to the transition to a low-carbon
economy. Accordingly, we have a goal, publicly announced in
early 2021, to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions in
our financing activities, operations and supply chain before
2050 (Net Zero Goal). More broadly, achieving this goal will
require technological advances, clearly defined roadmaps for
industry sectors, public policies, and better emissions data
reporting, as well as ongoing, strong and active engagement
with clients, suppliers, investors, government officials and other
stakeholders.
Our progress towards achieving our Net Zero Goal is based
on establishing the baseline for emissions associated with our
financing activities often referred to as financed emissions.
Currently, we are using the Partnership for Carbon Accounting
Financials methodology to assess our financed emissions.
Additionally, given the urgency required to address climate
change, we helped to launch the Net Zero Banking Alliance
(NZBA) in April 2021, which outlines guidelines for banks to
achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions including
requirements for setting interim targets. As a member of NZBA,
the Corporation and more than 100 other financial institution
members representing more than 40 percent of the world9s
banking assets, have committed to set emission reduction
targets for 2030. We plan to begin disclosure of financed
emissions by 2023, and set 2030 targets for the significant
majority of emissions in our portfolio.
In 2021, we also announced a goal to deploy $1 trillion by
2030 to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon, sustainable
economy by providing lending, capital raising, advisory and
investment services, and by developing other client-driven
financial solutions. This commitment anchors a broader $1.5

trillion sustainable finance goal to support both environmental
transition and social inclusive development, which spans
business activities across the globe. These goals are intended
to help drive business opportunities and enhance risk
management related to the transition to a low-carbon economy.
For more information about climate risk, see the Bank of
America website. For more information about the Corporation9s
climate-related goals and commitments, including emissions
associated with our operations and supply chain and progress
on our sustainable finance goals, see the Corporation9s 2021
Annual Report to shareholders that will be available on the
Investor Relations portion of our website in March 2022. The
contents of the Corporation9s website and 2021 Annual Report
to shareholders are not incorporated by reference into this
Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The foregoing discussion and our discussion in the 2021
Annual Report to shareholders regarding our goals and
commitments with respect to climate risk management,
including environmental transition considerations, include
<forward-looking statements= within the meaning of the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are
not guarantees of future results or performance and involve
certain known and unknown risks, uncertainties and
assumptions that are difficult to predict and are often beyond
the Corporation9s control. Actual outcomes and results may
differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, any of
these forward-looking statements.
Complex Accounting Estimates
Our significant accounting principles, as described in Note 1 3
Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated
Financial Statements, are essential in understanding the MD&A.
Many of our significant accounting principles require complex
judgments to estimate the values of assets and liabilities. We
have procedures and processes in place to facilitate making
these judgments.
The more judgmental estimates are summarized in the
following discussion. We have identified and described the
development of the variables most important in the estimation
processes that involve mathematical models to derive the
estimates. In many cases, there are numerous alternative
judgments that could be used in the process of determining the
inputs to the models. Where alternatives exist, we have used
the factors that we believe represent the most reasonable value
in developing the inputs. Actual performance that differs from
our estimates of the key variables could materially impact our
results of operations. Separate from the possible future impact
to our results of operations from input and model variables, the
value of our lending portfolio and market-sensitive assets and
liabilities may change subsequent to the balance sheet date,
often significantly, due to the nature and magnitude of future
credit and market conditions. Such credit and market conditions
may change quickly and in unforeseen ways and the resulting
volatility could have a significant, negative effect on future
operating results. These fluctuations would not be indicative of
deficiencies in our models or inputs.
Bank of America 2021 121
Allowance for Credit Losses
The allowance for credit losses includes the allowance for loan
and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending
commitments. Our process for determining the allowance for
credit losses is discussed in Note 1 3 Summary of Significant
Accounting Principles and Note 5 3 Outstanding Loans and
Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.
The determination of allowance for credit losses is based on
numerous estimates and assumptions, which require a high
degree of judgment and are often interrelated. A critical
judgment in the process is the weighting of our forward-looking
macroeconomic scenarios that are incorporated into our
quantitative models. As any one economic outlook is inherently
uncertain, the Corporation uses multiple macroeconomic
scenarios in its expected credit losses (ECL) calculation, which
have included a baseline scenario, which is derived from
consensus estimates, downside scenarios, a tail risk scenario
similar to the severely adverse scenario used in stress testing
and an upside scenario. Beginning in 2020, the scenarios
incorporated the potential impacts of the pandemic and,
beginning in the second quarter in 2021, an additional scenario
was added to account for inflationary risk and higher interest
rates. Generally, as the consensus estimates improve or
deteriorate, the allowance for credit losses will change in a
similar direction.
There are multiple variables that drive the macroeconomic
scenarios with the key variables including, but not limited to,
U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) and unemployment rates.
As of December 31, 2020, the weighted macroeconomic
outlook for U.S. average unemployment rate was forecasted at
6.6 percent, 5.5 percent and 5.0 percent in the fourth quarters
of 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively, and the weighted
macroeconomic outlook for U.S. GDP was forecasted to grow at
2.5 percent, 2.4 percent and 2.1 percent year-over-year in the
fourth quarters of 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively. As of
December 31, 2021 the latest consensus estimates for the
U.S. average unemployment rate for the fourth quarter of 2021
was 4.4 percent and U.S. GDP was forecasted to grow 5.2
percent year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2021, both of
which were meaningfully better than our macroeconomic outlook
as of December 31, 2020 and were factored into our December
31, 2021 allowance for credit losses estimate. In addition, as
of December 31, 2021, the weighted macroeconomic outlook
for the U.S. average unemployment rate was forecasted at 5.2
percent and 4.7 percent in the fourth quarters of 2022 and
2023, and the weighted macroeconomic outlook for U.S. GDP
was forecasted to grow 2.1 percent and 1.9 percent year-over-
year in the fourth quarters of 2022 and 2023.
In addition to the above judgments and estimates, the
allowance for credit losses can also be impacted by
unanticipated changes in asset quality of the portfolio, such as
increases or decreases in credit and/or internal risk ratings in
our commercial portfolio, improvement or deterioration in
borrower delinquencies or credit scores in our credit card
portfolio and increases or decreases in home prices, which is a
primary driver of LTVs, in our consumer real estate portfolio, all

of which have some degree of uncertainty. As the
macroeconomic outlook improved in 2021, along with
improvements in asset quality, the allowance for credit losses
decreased to $13.8 billion from $20.7 billion at December 31,
2020.
To provide an illustration of the sensitivity of the
macroeconomic scenarios and other assumptions on the
estimate of our allowance for credit losses, the Corporation
compared the December 31, 2021 modeled ECL from the
baseline scenario and our downside scenario. Relative to the
baseline scenario, the downside scenario assumed a peak U.S.
unemployment rate of approximately three percentage points
higher than the consensus outlook, a decline in U.S. GDP
followed by a prolonged recovery and a lower home price outlook
with a difference of 14 percent at the trough. This sensitivity
analysis resulted in a hypothetical increase in the allowance for
credit losses of approximately $5 billion.
While the sensitivity analysis may be useful to understand
how changes in macroeconomic assumptions could impact our
modeled ECLs, it is not meant to forecast how our allowance for
credit losses is expected to change in a different
macroeconomic outlook. Importantly, the analysis does not
incorporate a variety of factors, including qualitative reserves
and the weighting of alternate scenarios, which could have
offsetting effects on the estimate. Considering the variety of
factors contemplated when developing and weighting
macroeconomic outlooks such as recent economic events,
leading economic indicators, views of internal and third-party
economists and industry trends, in addition to other qualitative
factors, the Corporation believes the allowance for credit losses
at December 31, 2021 is appropriate.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Under applicable accounting standards, we are required to
maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of
unobservable inputs in measuring fair value. We classify fair
value measurements of financial instruments and MSRs based
on the three-level fair value hierarchy in the accounting
standards.
The fair values of assets and liabilities may include
adjustments, such as market liquidity and credit quality, where
appropriate. Valuations of products using models or other
techniques are sensitive to assumptions used for the significant
inputs. Where market data is available, the inputs used for
valuation reflect that information as of our valuation date. Inputs
to valuation models are considered unobservable if they are
supported by little or no market activity. In periods of extreme
volatility, lessened liquidity or in illiquid markets, there may be
more variability in market pricing or a lack of market data to use
in the valuation process. In keeping with the prudent application
of estimates and management judgment in determining the fair
value of assets and liabilities, we have in place various
processes and controls that include: a model validation policy
that requires review and approval of quantitative models used
for deal pricing, financial statement fair value determination and
risk quantification; a trading product valuation policy that
requires verification of all traded product valuations; and a
periodic review and substantiation of daily profit and loss
122 Bank of America 2021
reporting for all traded products. Primarily through validation
controls, we utilize both broker and pricing service inputs which
can and do include both market-observable and internally-
modeled values and/or valuation inputs. Our reliance on this
information is affected by our understanding of how the broker
and/or pricing service develops its data with a higher degree of
reliance applied to those that are more directly observable and
lesser reliance applied to those developed through their own
internal modeling. For example, broker quotes in less active
markets may only be indicative and therefore less reliable.
These processes and controls are performed independently of
the business. For more information, see Note 20 3 Fair Value
Measurements and Note 21 3 Fair Value Option to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Level 3 Assets and Liabilities
Financial assets and liabilities, and MSRs, where values are
based on valuation techniques that require inputs that are both
unobservable and are significant to the overall fair value
measurement are classified as Level 3 under the fair value
hierarchy established in applicable accounting standards. The
fair value of these Level 3 financial assets and liabilities and
MSRs is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow
methodologies or similar techniques for which the determination
of fair value requires significant management judgment or
estimation.
Level 3 financial instruments may be hedged with derivatives
classified as Level 1 or 2; therefore, gains or losses associated
with Level 3 financial instruments may be offset by gains or
losses associated with financial instruments classified in other
levels of the fair value hierarchy. The Level 3 gains and losses
recorded in earnings did not have a significant impact on our
liquidity or capital. We conduct a review of our fair value
hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. Transfers into or
out of Level 3 are made if the significant inputs used in the
financial models measuring the fair values of the assets and
liabilities became unobservable or observable, respectively, in
the current marketplace. For more information on transfers into
and out of Level 3 during 2021, 2020 and 2019, see Note 20 3
Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Accrued Income Taxes and Deferred Tax Assets
Accrued income taxes, reported as a component of either other
assets or accrued expenses and other liabilities on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet, represent the net amount of
current income taxes we expect to pay to or receive from various
taxing jurisdictions attributable to our operations to date. We
currently file income tax returns in more than 100 jurisdictions
and consider many factors, including statutory, judicial and

regulatory guidance, in estimating the appropriate accrued
income taxes for each jurisdiction.
Net deferred tax assets, reported as a component of other
assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, represent the net
decrease in taxes expected to be paid in the future because of
net operating loss (NOL) and tax credit carryforwards and
because of future reversals of temporary differences in the
bases of assets and liabilities as measured by tax laws and
their bases as reported in the financial statements. NOL and tax
credit carryforwards result in reductions to future tax liabilities,
and many of these attributes can expire if not utilized within
certain periods. We consider the need for valuation allowances
to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amounts that we
estimate are more likely than not to be realized.
Consistent with the applicable accounting guidance, we
monitor relevant tax authorities and change our estimates of
accrued income taxes and/or net deferred tax assets due to
changes in income tax laws and their interpretation by the
courts and regulatory authorities. These revisions of our
estimates, which also may result from our income tax planning
and from the resolution of income tax audit matters, may be
material to our operating results for any given period.

Statements for a table of significant tax attributes and
additional information. For more information see Item 1A. Risk

Goodwill and Intangible Assets
The nature of and accounting for goodwill and intangible assets
are discussed in Note 1 3 Summary of Significant Accounting
Principles, and Note 7 3 Goodwill and Intangible Assets to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.
We completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of
June 30, 2021 by using a qualitative assessment to determine
whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of each
reporting unit was less than its respective carrying value.
Factors considered in the qualitative assessment included,
among other things, macroeconomic conditions, industry and
market considerations, financial performance of the respective
reporting unit and other relevant entity- and reporting-unit
specific considerations. Based on our qualitative assessment,
we have concluded that it was not <more likely than not= that
the reporting units9 fair values were less than their carrying
values.
Certain Contingent Liabilities

certain contingent liabilities, see Note 12 3 Commitments and
Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Bank of America Corporation and Subsidiaries

The management of Bank of America Corporation is responsible
for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting.
The Corporation9s internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. The Corporation9s internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of
the assets of the Corporation; (ii) provide reasonable assurance
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America, and that receipts and expenditures of the Corporation
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the Corporation; and (iii) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection
of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
Corporation9s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the
Corporation9s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2021 based on the framework set forth by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission in Internal Control 3 Integrated Framework (2013).
Based on that assessment, management concluded that, as of
December 31, 2021, the Corporation9s internal control over
financial reporting is effective.
The Corporation9s internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2021 has been audited by
PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm, as stated in their accompanying report which
expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the
Corporation9s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2021.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

Bank of America Corporation and Subsidiaries

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Bank

of America Corporation:

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal

Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets of Bank of America Corporation and its subsidiaries (the
<Corporation=) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the
related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive
income, changes in shareholders9 equity and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2021, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the
<consolidated financial statements=). We also have audited the
Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal
Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of the Corporation as of December 31, 2021
and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2021 in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion,
the Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control -
Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.

Change in Accounting Principle
As discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial
statements, the Corporation changed the manner in which it
accounts for credit losses on certain financial instruments in

Basis for Opinions
The Corporation9s management is responsible for these
consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment
of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,
included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express
opinions on the Corporation9s consolidated financial statements
and on the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting
based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered
with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with
respect to the Corporation in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards
of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the consolidated financial statements are free of
material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and
whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the
consolidated financial statements included performing
procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the
consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or

fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.
Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated
financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of
the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal
control over financial reporting included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also
included performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over
Financial Reporting
A company9s internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company9s internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions
and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and
that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company9s assets that
could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters
arising from the current period audit of the consolidated
financial statements that were communicated or required to be
communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to
accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated
financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging,
subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical
audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the
consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we
are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below,
providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on
the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses - Commercial and
Consumer Card Loans
As described in Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial
statements, the allowance for loan and lease losses represents
management9s estimate of the expected credit losses in the
Bank of America 2021 127
Corporation9s loan and lease portfolio, excluding loans and
unfunded lending commitments accounted for under the fair
value option. As of December 31, 2021, the allowance for loan
and lease losses was $12.4 billion on total loans and leases of
$971.3 billion, which excludes loans accounted for under the
fair value option. For commercial and consumer card loans, the
expected credit loss is typically estimated using quantitative
methods that consider a variety of factors such as historical
loss experience, the current credit quality of the portfolio as well
as an economic outlook over the life of the loan. In its loss
forecasting framework, the Corporation incorporates forward
looking information through the use of macroeconomic
scenarios applied over the forecasted life of the assets. These
macroeconomic scenarios include variables that have
historically been key drivers of increases and decreases in
credit losses. These variables include, but are not limited to,
unemployment rates, real estate prices, gross domestic product
levels and corporate bond spreads. The scenarios that are
chosen and the weighting given to each scenario depend on a
variety of factors including recent economic events, leading
economic indicators, views of internal as well as third-party
economists and industry trends. Also included in the allowance
for loan and lease losses are qualitative reserves to cover
losses that are expected but, in the Corporation's assessment,
may not be adequately reflected in the quantitative methods or
the economic assumptions. Factors that the Corporation
considers include changes in lending policies and procedures,
business conditions, the nature and size of the portfolio,
portfolio concentrations, the volume and severity of past due
loans and nonaccrual loans, the effect of external factors such
as competition, and legal and regulatory requirements, among
others. Further, the Corporation considers the inherent
uncertainty in quantitative models that are built on historical
data.
The principal considerations for our determination that
performing procedures relating to the allowance for loan and
lease losses for the commercial and consumer card portfolios is
a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment and
estimation by management in developing lifetime economic
forecast scenarios, related weightings to each scenario and
certain qualitative reserves, which in turn led to a high degree of
auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing
procedures and in evaluating audit evidence obtained, and (ii)
the audit effort involved professionals with specialized skill and
knowledge.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and
evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall
opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These
procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls
relating to the allowance for loan and lease losses, including
controls over the evaluation and approval of models, forecast
scenarios and related weightings, and qualitative reserves.
These procedures also included, among others, testing
management9s process for estimating the allowance for loan
and lease losses, including (i) evaluating the appropriateness of
the loss forecast models and methodology, (ii) evaluating the
reasonableness of certain macroeconomic variables, (iii)
evaluating the reasonableness of management9s development,
selection and weighting of lifetime economic forecast scenarios
used in the loss forecast models, (iv) testing the completeness
and accuracy of data used in the estimate, and (v) evaluating
the reasonableness of certain qualitative reserves made to the

model output results to determine the overall allowance for loan
and lease losses. The procedures also included the involvement
of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist
in evaluating the appropriateness of certain loss forecast
models, the reasonableness of economic forecast scenarios
and related weightings and the reasonableness of certain
qualitative reserves.
Valuation of Certain Level 3 Financial Instruments
As described in Notes 1 and 20 to the consolidated financial
statements, the Corporation carries certain financial
instruments at fair value, which includes $10.7 billion of assets
and $6.9 billion of liabilities classified as Level 3 fair value
measurements that are valued on a recurring basis and $2.3
billion of assets classified as Level 3 fair value measurements
that are valued on a nonrecurring basis, for which the
determination of fair value requires significant management
judgment or estimation. The Corporation determines the fair
value of Level 3 financial instruments using pricing models,
discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques that
require inputs that are both unobservable and are significant to
the overall fair value measurement. Unobservable inputs, such
as volatility or price, may be determined using quantitative-
based extrapolations or other internal methodologies which
incorporate management estimates and available market
information.
The principal considerations for our determination that
performing procedures relating to the valuation of certain Level
3 financial instruments is a critical audit matter are the
significant judgment and estimation used by management to
determine the fair value of these financial instruments, which in
turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and
effort in performing procedures and in evaluating audit evidence
obtained, including the involvement of professionals with
specialized skill and knowledge.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and
evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall
opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These
procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls
relating to the valuation of financial instruments, including
controls related to valuation models, significant unobservable
inputs, and data. These procedures also included, among
others, the involvement of professionals with specialized skill
and knowledge to assist in developing an independent estimate
of fair value for a sample of these certain financial instruments
and comparison of management9s estimate to the
independently developed estimate of fair value. Developing the
independent estimate involved testing the completeness and
accuracy of data provided by management and evaluating the
reasonableness of management9s significant unobservable
inputs.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

NOTE 1 Summary of Significant Accounting

Principles

Bank of America Corporation, a bank holding company and a
financial holding company, provides a diverse range of financial
services and products throughout the U.S. and in certain
international markets. The term <the Corporation= as used
herein may refer to Bank of America Corporation, individually,
Bank of America Corporation and its subsidiaries, or certain of
Bank of America Corporation9s subsidiaries or affiliates.

Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of
the Corporation and its majority-owned subsidiaries and those
variable interest entities (VIEs) where the Corporation is the
primary beneficiary. Intercompany accounts and transactions
have been eliminated. Results of operations of acquired
companies are included from the dates of acquisition, and for
VIEs, from the dates that the Corporation became the primary
beneficiary. Assets held in an agency or fiduciary capacity are
not included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The
Corporation accounts for investments in companies for which it
owns a voting interest and for which it has the ability to exercise
significant influence over operating and financing decisions
using the equity method of accounting. These investments,
which include the Corporation9s interests in affordable housing
and renewable energy partnerships, are recorded in other
assets. Equity method investments are subject to impairment
testing, and the Corporation9s proportionate share of income or
loss is included in other income.
The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and
disclosures. Actual results could materially differ from those
estimates and assumptions. Certain prior-period amounts have
been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.

Significant Accounting Principles

Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, cash items in
the process of collection, cash segregated under federal and
other brokerage regulations, and amounts due from
correspondent banks, the Federal Reserve Bank and certain
non-U.S. central banks. Certain cash balances are restricted as
to withdrawal or usage by legally binding contractual agreements
or regulatory requirements.

Securities Financing Agreements
Securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell
and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase
(securities financing agreements) are treated as collateralized
financing transactions except in instances where the transaction
is required to be accounted for as individual sale and purchase
transactions. Generally, these agreements are recorded at
acquisition or sale price plus accrued interest. In instances
where the interest is negative, the Corporation9s policy is to
present negative interest on financial assets as interest income
and negative interest on financial liabilities as interest expense.
For securities financing agreements that are accounted for
under the fair value option, the changes in the fair value of
these securities financing agreements are recorded in market

making and similar activities in the Consolidated Statement of
Income.
The Corporation9s policy is to monitor the market value of
the principal amount loaned under resale agreements and
obtain collateral from or return collateral pledged to
counterparties when appropriate. Securities financing
agreements do not create material credit risk due to these
collateral provisions; therefore, an allowance for loan losses is
not necessary.
In transactions where the Corporation acts as the lender in a
securities lending agreement and receives securities that can
be pledged or sold as collateral, it recognizes an asset on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value, representing the
securities received, and a liability, representing the obligation to
return those securities.
Collateral
The Corporation accepts securities and loans as collateral that
it is permitted by contract or practice to sell or repledge. At
December 31, 2021 and 2020, the fair value of this collateral
was $854.8 billion and $812.4 billion, of which $782.7 billion
and $758.5 billion were sold or repledged. The primary source
of this collateral is securities borrowed or purchased under
agreements to resell.
The Corporation also pledges company-owned securities and
loans as collateral in transactions that include repurchase
agreements, securities loaned, public and trust deposits, U.S.
Treasury tax and loan notes, and short-term borrowings. This
collateral, which in some cases can be sold or repledged by the
counterparties to the transactions, is parenthetically disclosed
on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
In certain cases, the Corporation has transferred assets to
consolidated VIEs where those restricted assets serve as
collateral for the interests issued by the VIEs. These assets are
included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in Assets of
Consolidated VIEs.
In addition, the Corporation obtains collateral in connection
with its derivative contracts. Required collateral levels vary
depending on the credit risk rating and the type of counterparty.
Generally, the Corporation accepts collateral in the form of
cash, U.S. Treasury securities and other marketable securities.
Based on provisions contained in master netting agreements,
the Corporation nets cash collateral received against derivative
assets. The Corporation also pledges collateral on its own
derivative positions which can be applied against derivative
liabilities.
Trading Instruments
Financial instruments utilized in trading activities are carried at
fair value. Fair value is generally based on quoted market prices
for the same or similar assets and liabilities. If these market
prices are not available, fair values are estimated based on
dealer quotes, pricing models, discounted cash flow
methodologies, or similar techniques where the determination
of fair value may require significant management judgment or
estimation. Realized gains and losses are recorded on a trade-
date basis. Realized and unrealized gains and losses are
recognized in market making and similar activities.
Derivatives and Hedging Activities
Derivatives are entered into on behalf of customers, for trading
or to support risk management activities. Derivatives used in
risk management activities include derivatives that are both
designated in qualifying accounting hedge relationships and
derivatives used to hedge market risks in relationships that are
Bank of America 2021 133
not designated in qualifying accounting hedge relationships
(referred to as other risk management activities). The
Corporation manages interest rate and foreign currency
exchange rate sensitivity predominantly through the use of
derivatives. Derivatives utilized by the Corporation include
swaps, futures and forward settlement contracts, and option
contracts.
All derivatives are recorded on the Consolidated Balance
Sheet at fair value, taking into consideration the effects of
legally enforceable master netting agreements that allow the
Corporation to settle positive and negative positions and offset
cash collateral held with the same counterparty on a net basis.
For exchange-traded contracts, fair value is based on quoted
market prices in active or inactive markets or is derived from
observable market-based pricing parameters, similar to those
applied to over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives. For non-exchange
traded contracts, fair value is based on dealer quotes, pricing
models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar
techniques for which the determination of fair value may require
significant management judgment or estimation.
Valuations of derivative assets and liabilities reflect the
value of the instrument including counterparty credit risk. These
values also take into account the Corporation9s own credit
standing.

Trading Derivatives and Other Risk Management Activities
Derivatives held for trading purposes are included in derivative
assets or derivative liabilities on the Consolidated Balance
Sheet with changes in fair value included in market making and
similar activities.
Derivatives used for other risk management activities are
included in derivative assets or derivative liabilities. Derivatives
used in other risk management activities have not been
designated in qualifying accounting hedge relationships because
they did not qualify or the risk that is being mitigated pertains to
an item that is reported at fair value through earnings so that
the effect of measuring the derivative instrument and the asset
or liability to which the risk exposure pertains will offset in the
Consolidated Statement of Income to the extent effective. The
changes in the fair value of derivatives that serve to mitigate
certain risks associated with mortgage servicing rights (MSRs),
interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) and first-lien mortgage
loans held-for-sale (LHFS) that are originated by the Corporation
are recorded in other income. Changes in the fair value of
derivatives that serve to mitigate interest rate risk and foreign
currency risk are included in market making and similar
activities. Credit derivatives are also used by the Corporation to
mitigate the risk associated with various credit exposures. The
changes in the fair value of these derivatives are included in
market making and similar activities and other income.

Derivatives Used For Hedge Accounting Purposes
(Accounting Hedges)
For accounting hedges, the Corporation formally documents at
inception all relationships between hedging instruments and
hedged items, as well as the risk management objectives and
strategies for undertaking various accounting hedges.
Additionally, the Corporation primarily uses regression analysis
at the inception of a hedge and for each reporting period
thereafter to assess whether the derivative used in an
accounting hedge transaction is expected to be and has been
highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash
flows of a hedged item or forecasted transaction. The
Corporation discontinues hedge accounting when it is
determined that a derivative is not expected to be or has

ceased to be highly effective as a hedge, and then reflects
changes in fair value of the derivative in earnings after
termination of the hedge relationship.
Fair value hedges are used to protect against changes in the
fair value of the Corporation9s assets and liabilities that are
attributable to interest rate or foreign exchange volatility.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as fair value
hedges are recorded in earnings, together and in the same
income statement line item with changes in the fair value of the
related hedged item. If a derivative instrument in a fair value
hedge is terminated or the hedge designation removed, the
previous adjustments to the carrying value of the hedged asset
or liability are subsequently accounted for in the same manner
as other components of the carrying value of that asset or
liability. For interest-earning assets and interest-bearing
liabilities, such adjustments are amortized to earnings over the
remaining life of the respective asset or liability.
Cash flow hedges are used primarily to minimize the
variability in cash flows of assets and liabilities or forecasted
transactions caused by interest rate or foreign exchange rate
fluctuations. The Corporation also uses cash flow hedges to
hedge the price risk associated with deferred compensation.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives used in cash flow
hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive
income (OCI) and are reclassified into the line item in the
income statement in which the hedged item is recorded in the
same period the hedged item affects earnings. Components of
a derivative that are excluded in assessing hedge effectiveness
are recorded in the same income statement line item as the
hedged item.
Net investment hedges are used to manage the foreign
exchange rate sensitivity arising from a net investment in a
foreign operation. Changes in the spot prices of derivatives that
are designated as net investment hedges of foreign operations
are recorded as a component of accumulated OCI. The
remaining components of these derivatives are excluded in
assessing hedge effectiveness and are recorded in market
making and similar activities.
Securities
Debt securities are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet
at their trade date. Their classification is dependent on the
purpose for which the securities were acquired. Debt securities
purchased for use in the Corporation9s trading activities are
reported in trading account assets at fair value with unrealized
gains and losses included in market making and similar
activities. Substantially all other debt securities purchased are
used in the Corporation9s asset and liability management (ALM)
activities and are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet
as either debt securities carried at fair value or as held-to-
maturity (HTM) debt securities. Debt securities carried at fair
value are either available-for-sale (AFS) securities with
unrealized gains and losses net-of-tax included in accumulated
OCI or carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses
reported in market making and similar activities. HTM debt
securities are debt securities that management has the intent
and ability to hold to maturity and are reported at amortized
cost.
The Corporation evaluates each AFS security where the value
has declined below amortized cost. If the Corporation intends to
sell or believes it is more likely than not that it will be required
to sell the debt security, it is written down to fair value through
earnings. For AFS debt securities the Corporation intends to
hold, the Corporation evaluates the debt securities for expected
credit losses (ECL), except for debt securities that are
134 Bank of America 2021
guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury, U.S. government agencies or
sovereign entities of high credit quality where the Corporation
applies a zero credit loss assumption. For the remaining AFS
debt securities, the Corporation considers qualitative
parameters such as internal and external credit ratings and the
value of underlying collateral. If an AFS debt security fails any of
the qualitative parameters, a discounted cash flow analysis is
used by the Corporation to determine if a portion of the
unrealized loss is a result of an expected credit loss. The
Corporation will then recognize either credit loss expense or a
reversal of credit loss expense in other income for the amount
necessary to adjust the debt securities valuation allowance to
its current estimate of excepted credit losses. Cash flows
expected to be collected are estimated using all relevant
information available such as remaining payment terms,
prepayment speeds, the financial condition of the issuer,
expected defaults and the value of the underlying collateral. If
any of the decline in fair value is related to market factors, that
amount is recognized in accumulated OCI. In certain instances,
the credit loss may exceed the total decline in fair value, in
which case, the allowance recorded is limited to the difference
between the amortized cost and the fair value of the asset.
The Corporation separately evaluates its HTM debt securities
for any credit losses, of which substantially all qualify for the
zero loss assumption. For the remaining securities, the
Corporation performs a discounted cash flow analysis to
estimate any credit losses which are then recognized as part of
the allowance for credit losses.
Interest on debt securities, including amortization of
premiums and accretion of discounts, is included in interest
income. Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted to
interest income at a constant effective yield over the contractual
lives of the securities. Realized gains and losses from the sales
of debt securities are determined using the specific
identification method.
Equity securities with readily determinable fair values that
are not held for trading purposes are carried at fair value with
unrealized gains and losses included in other income. Equity
securities that do not have readily determinable fair values are
recorded at cost less impairment, if any, plus or minus
qualifying observable price changes. These securities are
reported in other assets.

Loans and Leases
Loans, with the exception of loans accounted for under the fair
value option, are measured at historical cost and reported at
their outstanding principal balances net of any unearned
income, charge-offs, unamortized deferred fees and costs on
originated loans, and for purchased loans, net of any
unamortized premiums or discounts. Loan origination fees and
certain direct origination costs are deferred and recognized as
adjustments to interest income over the lives of the related
loans. Unearned income, discounts and premiums are
amortized to interest income using a level yield methodology.
The Corporation elects to account for certain consumer and
commercial loans under the fair value option with interest
reported in interest income and changes in fair value reported in
market making and similar activities or other income.
Under applicable accounting guidance, for reporting
purposes, the loan and lease portfolio is categorized by portfolio
segment and, within each portfolio segment, by class of
financing receivables. A portfolio segment is defined as the level
at which an entity develops and documents a systematic
methodology to determine the allowance for credit losses, and a
class of financing receivables is defined as the level of

disaggregation of portfolio segments based on the initial
measurement attribute, risk characteristics and methods for
assessing risk. The Corporation9s three portfolio segments are
Consumer Real Estate, Credit Card and Other Consumer, and
Commercial. The classes within the Consumer Real Estate
portfolio segment are residential mortgage and home equity.
The classes within the Credit Card and Other Consumer portfolio
segment are credit card, direct/indirect consumer and other
consumer. The classes within the Commercial portfolio segment
are U.S. commercial, non-U.S. commercial, commercial real
estate, commercial lease financing and U.S. small business
commercial.
Leases
The Corporation provides equipment financing to its customers
through a variety of lessor arrangements. Direct financing
leases and sales-type leases are carried at the aggregate of
lease payments receivable plus the estimated residual value of
the leased property less unearned income, which is accreted to
interest income over the lease terms using methods that
approximate the interest method. Operating lease income is
recognized on a straight-line basis. The Corporation's lease
arrangements generally do not contain non-lease components.
Allowance for Credit Losses
The allowance for credit losses includes both the allowance for
loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending
commitments and represents management9s estimate of the
ECL in the Corporation9s loan and lease portfolio, excluding
loans and unfunded lending commitments accounted for under
the fair value option. The ECL on funded consumer and
commercial loans and leases is referred to as the allowance for
loan and lease losses and is reported separately as a contra-
asset to loans and leases on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
The ECL for unfunded lending commitments, including home
equity lines of credit (HELOCs), standby letters of credit (SBLCs)
and binding unfunded loan commitments is reported on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet in accrued expenses and other
liabilities. The provision for credit losses related to the loan and
lease portfolio and unfunded lending commitments is reported
in the Consolidated Statement of Income at the amount
necessary to adjust the allowance for credit losses to the
current estimate of ECL.
For loans and leases, the ECL is typically estimated using
quantitative methods that consider a variety of factors such as
historical loss experience, the current credit quality of the
portfolio as well as an economic outlook over the life of the
loan. The life of the loan for closed-ended products is based on
the contractual maturity of the loan adjusted for any expected
prepayments. The contractual maturity includes any extension
options that are at the sole discretion of the borrower. For open-
ended products (e.g., lines of credit), the ECL is determined
based on the maximum repayment term associated with future
draws from credit lines unless those lines of credit are
unconditionally cancellable (e.g., credit cards) in which case the
Corporation does not record any allowance.
In its loss forecasting framework, the Corporation
incorporates forward-looking information through the use of
macroeconomic scenarios applied over the forecasted life of the
assets. These macroeconomic scenarios include variables that
have historically been key drivers of increases and decreases in
credit losses. These variables include, but are not limited to,
unemployment rates, real estate prices, gross domestic product
levels and corporate bond spreads. As any one economic
outlook is inherently uncertain, the Corporation leverages
Bank of America 2021 135
multiple scenarios. The scenarios that are chosen each quarter
and the weighting given to each scenario depend on a variety of
factors including recent economic events, leading economic
indicators, views of internal and third-party economists and
industry trends.
The estimate of credit losses includes expected recoveries
of amounts previously charged off (i.e., negative allowance). If a
loan has been charged off, the expected cash flows on the loan
are not limited by the current amortized cost balance. Instead,
expected cash flows can be assumed up to the unpaid principal
balance immediately prior to the charge-off.
The allowance for loan and lease losses for troubled debt
restructurings (TDR) is measured based on the present value of
projected future lifetime principal and interest cash flows
discounted at the loan9s original effective interest rate, or in
cases where foreclosure is probable or the loan is collateral
dependent, at the loan9s collateral value or its observable
market price, if available. The measurement of ECL for the
renegotiated consumer credit card TDR portfolio is based on the
present value of projected cash flows discounted using the
average TDR portfolio contractual interest rate, excluding
promotionally priced loans, in effect prior to restructuring.
Projected cash flows for TDRs use the same economic outlook
as discussed above. For purposes of computing this specific
loss component of the allowance, larger impaired loans are
evaluated individually and smaller impaired loans are evaluated
as a pool.
Also included in the allowance for loan and lease losses are
qualitative reserves to cover losses that are expected but, in the
Corporation's assessment, may not be adequately reflected in
the quantitative methods or the economic assumptions
described above. For example, factors that the Corporation
considers include changes in lending policies and procedures,
business conditions, the nature and size of the portfolio,
portfolio concentrations, the volume and severity of past due
loans and nonaccrual loans, the effect of external factors such
as competition, and legal and regulatory requirements, among
others. Further, the Corporation considers the inherent
uncertainty in quantitative models that are built on historical
data.
With the exception of the Corporation's credit card portfolio,
the Corporation does not include reserves for interest receivable
in the measurement of the allowance for credit losses as the
Corporation generally classifies consumer loans as
nonperforming at 90 days past due and reverses interest
income for these loans at that time. For credit card loans, the
Corporation reserves for interest and fees as part of the
allowance for loan and lease losses. Upon charge-off of a credit
card loan, the Corporation reverses the interest and fee income
against the income statement line item where it was originally
recorded.
The Corporation has identified the following three portfolio
segments and measures the allowance for credit losses using
the following methods.

Consumer Real Estate
To estimate ECL for consumer loans secured by residential real
estate, the Corporation estimates the number of loans that will
default over the life of the existing portfolio, after factoring in
estimated prepayments, using quantitative modeling
methodologies. The attributes that are most significant in
estimating the Corporation9s ECL include refreshed loan-to-value
(LTV) or, in the case of a subordinated lien, refreshed combined
LTV (CLTV), borrower credit score, months since origination and

geography, all of which are further broken down by present
collection status (whether the loan is current, delinquent, in
default, or in bankruptcy). The estimates are based on the
Corporation9s historical experience with the loan portfolio,
adjusted to reflect the economic outlook. The outlook on the
unemployment rate and consumer real estate prices are key
factors that impact the frequency and severity of loss estimates.
The Corporation does not reserve for credit losses on the
unpaid principal balance of loans insured by the Federal
Housing Administration (FHA) and long-term standby loans, as
these loans are fully insured. The Corporation records a reserve
for unfunded lending commitments for the ECL associated with
the undrawn portion of the Corporation9s HELOCs, which can
only be canceled by the Corporation if certain criteria are met.
The ECL associated with these unfunded lending commitments
is calculated using the same models and methodologies noted
above and incorporate utilization assumptions at time of
default.
For loans that are more than 180 days past due and
collateral-dependent TDRs, the Corporation bases the allowance
on the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral as of the
reporting date less costs to sell. The fair value of the collateral
securing these loans is generally determined using an
automated valuation model (AVM) that estimates the value of a
property by reference to market data including sales of
comparable properties and price trends specific to the
Metropolitan Statistical Area in which the property being valued
is located. In the event that an AVM value is not available, the
Corporation utilizes publicized indices or if these methods
provide less reliable valuations, the Corporation uses appraisals
or broker price opinions to estimate the fair value of the
collateral. While there is inherent imprecision in these
valuations, the Corporation believes that they are representative
of this portfolio in the aggregate.
For loans that are more than 180 days past due and
collateral-dependent TDRs, with the exception of the
Corporation9s fully insured portfolio, the outstanding balance of
loans that is in excess of the estimated property value after
adjusting for costs to sell is charged off. If the estimated
property value decreases in periods subsequent to the initial
charge-off, the Corporation will record an additional charge-off;
however, if the value increases in periods subsequent to the
charge-off, the Corporation will adjust the allowance to account
for the increase but not to a level above the cumulative charge-
off amount.
Credit Cards and Other Consumer
Credit cards are revolving lines of credit without a defined
maturity date. The estimated life of a credit card receivable is
determined by estimating the amount and timing of expected
future payments (e.g., borrowers making full payments,
minimum payments or somewhere in between) that it will take
for a receivable balance to pay off. The ECL on the future
payments incorporates the spending behavior of a borrower
through time using key borrower-specific factors and the
economic outlook described above. The Corporation applies all
expected payments in accordance with the Credit Card
Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (i.e.,
paying down the highest interest rate bucket first). Then
forecasted future payments are prioritized to pay off the oldest
balance until it is brought to zero or an expected charge-off
amount. Unemployment rate outlook, borrower credit score,
delinquency status and historical payment behavior are all key
inputs into the credit card receivable loss forecasting model.
136 Bank of America 2021
Future draws on the credit card lines are excluded from the ECL
as they are unconditionally cancellable.
The ECL for the consumer vehicle lending portfolio is also
determined using quantitative methods supplemented with
qualitative analysis. The quantitative model estimates ECL
giving consideration to key borrower and loan characteristics
such as delinquency status, borrower credit score, LTV ratio,
underlying collateral type and collateral value.

Commercial
The ECL on commercial loans is forecasted using models that
estimate credit losses over the loan9s contractual life at an
individual loan level. The models use the contractual terms to
forecast future principal cash flows while also considering
expected prepayments. For open-ended commitments such as
revolving lines of credit, changes in funded balance are captured
by forecasting a borrower9s draw and payment behavior over the
remaining life of the commitment. For loans collateralized with
commercial real estate and for which the underlying asset is the
primary source of repayment, the loss forecasting models
consider key loan and customer attributes such as LTV ratio,
net operating income and debt service coverage, and captures
variations in behavior according to property type and region. The
outlook on the unemployment rate, gross domestic product, and
forecasted real estate prices are utilized to determine indicators
such as rent levels and vacancy rates, which impact the ECL
estimate. For all other commercial loans and leases, the loss
forecasting model determines the probabilities of transition to
different credit risk ratings or default at each point over the life
of the asset based on the borrower9s current credit risk rating,
industry sector, size of the exposure and the geographic market.
The severity of loss is determined based on the type of
collateral securing the exposure, the size of the exposure, the
borrower9s industry sector, any guarantors and the geographic
market. Assumptions of expected loss are conditioned to the
economic outlook, and the model considers key economic
variables such as unemployment rate, gross domestic product,
corporate bond spreads, real estate and other asset prices and
equity market returns.
In addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses, the
Corporation also estimates ECL related to unfunded lending
commitments such as letters of credit, financial guarantees,
unfunded bankers acceptances and binding loan commitments,
excluding commitments accounted for under the fair value
option. Reserves are estimated for the unfunded exposure using
the same models and methodologies as the funded exposure
and are reported as reserves for unfunded lending
commitments.

Nonperforming Loans and Leases, Charge-offs and
Delinquencies
Nonperforming loans and leases generally include loans and
leases that have been placed on nonaccrual status. Loans
accounted for under the fair value option and LHFS are not
reported as nonperforming. When a nonaccrual loan is deemed
uncollectible, it is charged off against the allowance for credit
losses. If the charged-off amount is later recovered, the amount
is reversed through the allowance for credit losses at the
recovery date. Charge-offs are reported net of recoveries (net
charge-offs). If recoveries for the period are greater than charge-
offs, net charge-offs are reported as a negative amount.
In accordance with the Corporation9s policies, consumer real
estate-secured loans, including residential mortgages and home
equity loans, are generally placed on nonaccrual status and
classified as nonperforming at 90 days past due unless

repayment of the loan is insured by the FHA or through
individually insured long-term standby agreements with Fannie
Mae (FNMA) or Freddie Mac (FHLMC) (the fully-insured portfolio).
Residential mortgage loans in the fully-insured portfolio are not
placed on nonaccrual status and, therefore, are not reported as
nonperforming. Junior-lien home equity loans are placed on
nonaccrual status and classified as nonperforming when the
underlying first-lien mortgage loan becomes 90 days past due
even if the junior-lien loan is current. The outstanding balance of
real estate-secured loans that is in excess of the estimated
property value less costs to sell is charged off no later than the
end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due
unless the loan is fully insured, or for loans in bankruptcy, within
60 days of receipt of notification of filing, with the remaining
balance classified as nonperforming.
Consumer loans secured by personal property, credit card
loans and other unsecured consumer loans are not placed on
nonaccrual status prior to charge-off and, therefore, are not
reported as nonperforming loans, except for certain secured
consumer loans, including those that have been modified in a
TDR. Personal property-secured loans (including auto loans) are
charged off to collateral value no later than the end of the
month in which the account becomes 120 days past due, or
upon repossession of an auto or, for loans in bankruptcy, within
60 days of receipt of notification of filing. Credit card and other
unsecured customer loans are charged off no later than the end
of the month in which the account becomes 180 days past due,
within 60 days after receipt of notification of death or
bankruptcy, or upon confirmation of fraud.
Commercial loans and leases, excluding business card
loans, that are past due 90 days or more as to principal or
interest, or where reasonable doubt exists as to timely
collection, including loans that are individually identified as
being impaired, are generally placed on nonaccrual status and
classified as nonperforming unless well-secured and in the
process of collection.
Business card loans are charged off in the same manner as
consumer credit card loans. Other commercial loans and leases
are generally charged off when all or a portion of the principal
amount is determined to be uncollectible.
The entire balance of a consumer loan or commercial loan or
lease is contractually delinquent if the minimum payment is not
received by the specified due date on the customer9s billing
statement. Interest and fees continue to accrue on past due
loans and leases until the date the loan is placed on nonaccrual
status, if applicable. Accrued interest receivable is reversed
when loans and leases are placed on nonaccrual status.
Interest collections on nonaccruing loans and leases for which
the ultimate collectability of principal is uncertain are applied as
principal reductions; otherwise, such collections are credited to
income when received. Loans and leases may be restored to
accrual status when all principal and interest is current and full
repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is
expected.
Troubled Debt Restructurings
Consumer and commercial loans and leases whose contractual
terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a
concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties are
classified as TDRs. Concessions could include a reduction in
the interest rate to a rate that is below market on the loan,
payment extensions, forgiveness of principal, forbearance or
other actions designed to maximize collections. Loans that are
carried at fair value and LHFS are not classified as TDRs.
Bank of America 2021 137
Loans and leases whose contractual terms have been
modified in a TDR and are current at the time of restructuring
may remain on accrual status if there is demonstrated
performance prior to the restructuring and payment in full under
the restructured terms is expected. Otherwise, the loans are
placed on nonaccrual status and reported as nonperforming,
except for fully-insured consumer real estate loans, until there is
sustained repayment performance for a reasonable period,
generally six months. If accruing TDRs cease to perform in
accordance with their modified contractual terms, they are
placed on nonaccrual status and reported as nonperforming
TDRs.
Secured consumer loans that have been discharged in
Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not been reaffirmed by the
borrower are classified as TDRs at the time of discharge. Such
loans are placed on nonaccrual status and written down to the
estimated collateral value less costs to sell no later than at the
time of discharge. If these loans are contractually current,
interest collections are generally recorded in interest income on
a cash basis. Consumer real estate-secured loans for which a
binding offer to restructure has been extended are also
classified as TDRs. Credit card and other unsecured consumer
loans that have been renegotiated in a TDR generally remain on
accrual status until the loan is either paid in full or charged off,
which occurs no later than the end of the month in which the
loan becomes 180 days past due or, for loans that have been
placed on a fixed payment plan, 120 days past due.
A loan that had previously been modified in a TDR and is
subsequently refinanced under current underwriting standards at
a market rate with no concessionary terms is accounted for as a
new loan and is no longer reported as a TDR.

COVID-19 Programs
The Corporation has implemented various consumer and
commercial loan modification programs to provide its borrowers
relief from the economic impacts of the Coronavirus Disease
2019 (COVID-19) pandemic (the pandemic). In accordance with
the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES
Act), the Corporation has elected to not apply TDR classification
to eligible COVID-19 related loan modifications that were
performed after March 1, 2020 to loans that were current as of
December 31, 2019. Accordingly, these restructurings are not
classified as TDRs. The availability of this election expired on
January 1, 2022. In addition, for loans modified in response to
the pandemic that do not meet the above criteria (e.g., current
payment status at December 31, 2019), the Corporation is
applying the guidance included in an interagency statement
issued by the bank regulatory agencies. This guidance states
that loan modifications performed in light of the pandemic,
including loan payment deferrals that are up to six months in
duration, that were granted to borrowers who were current as of
the implementation date of a loan modification program or
modifications granted under government mandated modification
programs, are not TDRs. For loan modifications that include a
payment deferral and are not TDRs, the borrowers' past due and
nonaccrual status have not been impacted during the deferral
period. The Corporation has continued to accrue interest during
the deferral period using a constant effective yield method. For
most mortgage, HELOC and commercial loan modifications, the
contractual interest that accrued during the deferral period is
payable at the maturity of the loan. The Corporation includes
these amounts with the unpaid principal balance when
computing its allowance for credit losses. Amounts that are
subsequently deemed uncollectible are written off against the
allowance for credit losses.

Loans Held-for-sale
Loans that the Corporation intends to sell in the foreseeable
future, including residential mortgages, loan syndications, and
to a lesser degree, commercial real estate, consumer finance
and other loans, are reported as LHFS and are carried at the
lower of aggregate cost or fair value. The Corporation accounts
for certain LHFS, including residential mortgage LHFS, under the
fair value option. Loan origination costs for LHFS carried at the
lower of cost or fair value are capitalized as part of the carrying
value of the loans and, upon the sale of a loan, are recognized
as part of the gain or loss in noninterest income. LHFS that are
on nonaccrual status and are reported as nonperforming, as
defined in the policy herein, are reported separately from
nonperforming loans and leases.
Premises and Equipment
Premises and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated
depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization
are recognized using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the assets. Estimated lives range up to 40 years
for buildings, up to 12 years for furniture and equipment, and
the shorter of lease term or estimated useful life for leasehold
improvements.
Other Assets
For the Corporation9s financial assets that are measured at
amortized cost and are not included in debt securities or loans
and leases on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Corporation
evaluates these assets for ECL using various techniques. For
assets that are subject to collateral maintenance provisions,
including federal funds sold and securities borrowed or
purchased under agreements to resell, where the collateral
consists of daily margining of liquid and marketable assets
where the margining is expected to be maintained into the
foreseeable future, the expected losses are assumed to be
zero. For all other assets, the Corporation performs qualitative
analyses, including consideration of historical losses and
current economic conditions, to estimate any ECL which are
then included in a valuation account that is recorded as a
contra-asset against the amortized cost basis of the financial
asset.
Lessee Arrangements
Substantially all of the Corporation9s lessee arrangements are
operating leases. Under these arrangements, the Corporation
records right-of-use assets and lease liabilities at lease
commencement. Right-of-use assets are reported in other
assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and the related
lease liabilities are reported in accrued expenses and other
liabilities. All leases are recorded on the Consolidated Balance
Sheet except leases with an initial term less than 12 months for
which the Corporation made the short-term lease election.
Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the
lease term and is recorded in occupancy and equipment
expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income.
The Corporation made an accounting policy election not to
separate lease and non-lease components of a contract that is
or contains a lease for its real estate and equipment leases. As
such, lease payments represent payments on both lease and
non-lease components. At lease commencement, lease
liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the
remaining lease payments and discounted using the
Corporation9s incremental borrowing rate. Right-of-use assets
initially equal the lease liability, adjusted for any lease payments
138 Bank of America 2021
made prior to lease commencement and for any lease
incentives.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Goodwill is the purchase premium after adjusting for the fair
value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is
reviewed for potential impairment on an annual basis, or when
events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment, at the
reporting unit level. A reporting unit is a business segment or
one level below a business segment.
The Corporation assesses the fair value of each reporting
unit against its carrying value, including goodwill, as measured
by allocated equity. For purposes of goodwill impairment testing,
the Corporation utilizes allocated equity as a proxy for the
carrying value of its reporting units. Allocated equity in the
reporting units is comprised of allocated capital plus capital for
the portion of goodwill and intangibles specifically assigned to
the reporting unit.
In performing its goodwill impairment testing, the
Corporation first assesses qualitative factors to determine
whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a
reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Qualitative factors
include, among other things, macroeconomic conditions,
industry and market considerations, financial performance of
the respective reporting unit and other relevant entity- and
reporting-unit specific considerations.
If the Corporation concludes it is more likely than not that
the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a
quantitative assessment is performed. The Corporation has an
unconditional option to bypass the qualitative assessment for
any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to
performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test. The
Corporation may resume performing the qualitative assessment
in any subsequent period.
When performing the quantitative assessment, if the fair
value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of
the reporting unit would not be considered impaired. If the
carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, a
goodwill impairment loss would be recognized for the amount by
which the reporting unit9s allocated equity exceeds its fair value.
An impairment loss recognized cannot exceed the amount of
goodwill assigned to a reporting unit. An impairment loss
establishes a new basis in the goodwill, and subsequent
reversals of goodwill impairment losses are not permitted under
applicable accounting guidance.
For intangible assets subject to amortization, an impairment
loss is recognized if the carrying value of the intangible asset is
not recoverable and exceeds fair value. The carrying value of the
intangible asset is considered not recoverable if it exceeds the
sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the
use of the asset. Intangible assets deemed to have indefinite
useful lives are not subject to amortization. An impairment loss
is recognized if the carrying value of the intangible asset with an
indefinite life exceeds its fair value.

Variable Interest Entities
A VIE is an entity that lacks equity investors or whose equity
investors do not have a controlling financial interest in the entity
through their equity investments. The Corporation consolidates
a VIE if it has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE
that most significantly impact the VIE9s economic performance
and an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive
benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. On a
quarterly basis, the Corporation reassesses its involvement with
the VIE and evaluates the impact of changes in governing

documents and its financial interests in the VIE. The
consolidation status of the VIEs with which the Corporation is
involved may change as a result of such reassessments.
The Corporation primarily uses VIEs for its securitization
activities, in which the Corporation transfers whole loans or debt
securities into a trust or other vehicle. When the Corporation is
the servicer of whole loans held in a securitization trust,
including non-agency residential mortgages, home equity loans,
credit cards, and other loans, the Corporation has the power to
direct the most significant activities of the trust. The Corporation
generally does not have the power to direct the most significant
activities of a residential mortgage agency trust except in certain
circumstances in which the Corporation holds substantially all of
the issued securities and has the unilateral right to liquidate the
trust. The power to direct the most significant activities of a
commercial mortgage securitization trust is typically held by the
special servicer or by the party holding specific subordinate
securities which embody certain controlling rights. The
Corporation consolidates a whole-loan securitization trust if it
has the power to direct the most significant activities and also
holds securities issued by the trust or has other contractual
arrangements, other than standard representations and
warranties, that could potentially be significant to the trust.
The Corporation may also transfer trading account securities
and AFS securities into municipal bond or resecuritization
trusts. The Corporation consolidates a municipal bond or
resecuritization trust if it has control over the ongoing activities
of the trust such as the remarketing of the trust9s liabilities or, if
there are no ongoing activities, sole discretion over the design
of the trust, including the identification of securities to be
transferred in and the structure of securities to be issued, and
also retains securities or has liquidity or other commitments
that could potentially be significant to the trust. The Corporation
does not consolidate a municipal bond or resecuritization trust if
one or a limited number of third-party investors share
responsibility for the design of the trust or have control over the
significant activities of the trust through liquidation or other
substantive rights.
Other VIEs used by the Corporation include collateralized
debt obligations (CDOs), investment vehicles created on behalf
of customers and other investment vehicles. The Corporation
does not routinely serve as collateral manager for CDOs and,
therefore, does not typically have the power to direct the
activities that most significantly impact the economic
performance of a CDO. However, following an event of default, if
the Corporation is a majority holder of senior securities issued
by a CDO and acquires the power to manage its assets, the
Corporation consolidates the CDO.
The Corporation consolidates a customer or other
investment vehicle if it has control over the initial design of the
vehicle or manages the assets in the vehicle and also absorbs
potentially significant gains or losses through an investment in
the vehicle, derivative contracts or other arrangements. The
Corporation does not consolidate an investment vehicle if a
single investor controlled the initial design of the vehicle or
manages the assets in the vehicles or if the Corporation does
not have a variable interest that could potentially be significant
to the vehicle.
Retained interests in securitized assets are initially recorded
at fair value. In addition, the Corporation may invest in debt
securities issued by unconsolidated VIEs. Fair values of these
debt securities, which are classified as trading account assets,
debt securities carried at fair value or HTM securities, are based
primarily on quoted market prices in active or inactive markets.
Generally, quoted market prices for retained residual interests
Bank of America 2021 139
are not available; therefore, the Corporation estimates fair
values based on the present value of the associated expected
future cash flows.

Fair Value
The Corporation measures the fair values of its assets and
liabilities, where applicable, in accordance with accounting
guidance that requires an entity to base fair value on exit price.
Under this guidance, an entity is required to maximize the use
of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable
inputs in measuring fair value. Under applicable accounting
standards, fair value measurements are categorized into one of
three levels based on the inputs to the valuation technique with
the highest priority given to unadjusted quoted prices in active
markets and the lowest priority given to unobservable inputs.
The Corporation categorizes its fair value measurements of
financial instruments based on this three-level hierarchy.

Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for
identical assets or liabilities. Level 1 assets and
liabilities include debt and equity securities and
derivative contracts that are traded in an active
exchange market, as well as certain U.S. Treasury
securities that are highly liquid and are actively traded
in OTC markets.
Level 2 Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as
quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted
prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs
that are observable or can be corroborated by
observable market data for substantially the full term
of the assets or liabilities. Level 2 assets and
liabilities include debt securities with quoted prices
that are traded less frequently than exchange-traded
instruments and derivative contracts where fair value is
determined using a pricing model with inputs that are
observable in the market or can be derived principally
from or corroborated by observable market data. This
category generally includes U.S. government and
agency mortgage-backed (MBS) and asset-backed
securities (ABS), corporate debt securities, derivative
contracts, certain loans and LHFS.
Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no
market activity and that are significant to the overall
fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets
and liabilities include financial instruments for which
the determination of fair value requires significant
management judgment or estimation. The fair value for
such assets and liabilities is generally determined
using pricing models, discounted cash flow
methodologies or similar techniques that incorporate
the assumptions a market participant would use in
pricing the asset or liability. This category generally
includes retained residual interests in securitizations,
consumer MSRs, certain ABS, highly structured,
complex or long-dated derivative contracts, certain
loans and LHFS, IRLCs and certain CDOs where
independent pricing information cannot be obtained for
a significant portion of the underlying assets.

Income Taxes
There are two components of income tax expense: current and
deferred. Current income tax expense reflects taxes to be paid
or refunded for the current period. Deferred income tax expense
results from changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities
between periods. These gross deferred tax assets and liabilities
represent decreases or increases in taxes expected to be paid

in the future because of future reversals of temporary
differences in the bases of assets and liabilities as measured
by tax laws and their bases as reported in the financial
statements. Deferred tax assets are also recognized for tax
attributes such as net operating loss carryforwards and tax
credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances are recorded to
reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts management
concludes are more likely than not to be realized.
Income tax benefits are recognized and measured based
upon a two-step model: first, a tax position must be more likely
than not to be sustained based solely on its technical merits in
order to be recognized, and second, the benefit is measured as
the largest dollar amount of that position that is more likely than
not to be sustained upon settlement. The difference between
the benefit recognized and the tax benefit claimed on a tax
return is referred to as an unrecognized tax benefit. The
Corporation records income tax-related interest and penalties, if
applicable, within income tax expense.
Revenue Recognition
The following summarizes the Corporation9s revenue recognition
accounting policies for certain noninterest income activities.
Card Income
Card income includes annual, late and over-limit fees as well as
interchange, cash advances and other miscellaneous items
from credit and debit card transactions and from processing
card transactions for merchants. Card income is presented net
of direct costs. Interchange fees are recognized upon
settlement of the credit and debit card payment transactions
and are generally determined on a percentage basis for credit
cards and fixed rates for debit cards based on the
corresponding payment network9s rates. Substantially all card
fees are recognized at the transaction date, except for certain
time-based fees such as annual fees, which are recognized over
12 months. Fees charged to cardholders and merchants that
are estimated to be uncollectible are reserved in the allowance
for loan and lease losses. Included in direct cost are rewards
and credit card partner payments. Rewards paid to cardholders
are related to points earned by the cardholder that can be
redeemed for a broad range of rewards including cash, travel
and gift cards. The points to be redeemed are estimated based
on past redemption behavior, card product type, account
transaction activity and other historical card performance. The
liability is reduced as the points are redeemed. The Corporation
also makes payments to credit card partners. The payments are
based on revenue-sharing agreements that are generally driven
by cardholder transactions and partner sales volumes. As part
of the revenue-sharing agreements, the credit card partner
provides the Corporation exclusive rights to market to the credit
card partner9s members or customers on behalf of the
Corporation.
Service Charges
Service charges include deposit and lending-related fees.
Deposit-related fees consist of fees earned on consumer and
commercial deposit activities and are generally recognized when
the transactions occur or as the service is performed. Consumer
fees are earned on consumer deposit accounts for account
maintenance and various transaction-based services, such as
ATM transactions, wire transfer activities, check and money
order processing and insufficient funds/overdraft transactions.
Commercial deposit-related fees are from the Corporation9s
Global Transaction Services business and consist of commercial
deposit and treasury management services, including account
maintenance and other services, such as payroll, sweep
140 Bank of America 2021
account and other cash management services. Lending-related
fees generally represent transactional fees earned from certain
loan commitments, financial guarantees and SBLCs.

Investment and Brokerage Services
Investment and brokerage services consist of asset
management and brokerage fees. Asset management fees are
earned from the management of client assets under advisory
agreements or the full discretion of the Corporation9s financial
advisors (collectively referred to as assets under management
(AUM)). Asset management fees are earned as a percentage of
the client9s AUM and generally range from 50 basis points (bps)
to 150 bps of the AUM. In cases where a third party is used to
obtain a client9s investment allocation, the fee remitted to the
third party is recorded net and is not reflected in the transaction
price, as the Corporation is an agent for those services.
Brokerage fees include income earned from transaction-
based services that are performed as part of investment
management services and are based on a fixed price per unit or
as a percentage of the total transaction amount. Brokerage fees
also include distribution fees and sales commissions that are
primarily in the Global Wealth & Investment Management (GWIM)
segment and are earned over time. In addition, primarily in the
Global Markets segment, brokerage fees are earned when the
Corporation fills customer orders to buy or sell various financial
products or when it acknowledges, affirms, settles and clears
transactions and/or submits trade information to the
appropriate clearing broker. Certain customers pay brokerage,
clearing and/or exchange fees imposed by relevant regulatory
bodies or exchanges in order to execute or clear trades. These
fees are recorded net and are not reflected in the transaction
price, as the Corporation is an agent for those services.

Investment Banking Income
Investment banking income includes underwriting income and
financial advisory services income. Underwriting consists of fees
earned for the placement of a customer9s debt or equity
securities. The revenue is generally earned based on a
percentage of the fixed number of shares or principal placed.
Once the number of shares or notes is determined and the
service is completed, the underwriting fees are recognized. The
Corporation incurs certain out-of-pocket expenses, such as legal
costs, in performing these services. These expenses are
recovered through the revenue the Corporation earns from the
customer and are included in operating expenses. Syndication
fees represent fees earned as the agent or lead lender
responsible for structuring, arranging and administering a loan
syndication.
Financial advisory services consist of fees earned for
assisting clients with transactions related to mergers and
acquisitions and financial restructurings. Revenue varies
depending on the size of the transaction and scope of services
performed and is generally contingent on successful completion
of the transaction. Revenue is typically recognized once the
transaction is completed and all services have been rendered.
Additionally, the Corporation may earn a fixed fee in merger and
acquisition transactions to provide a fairness opinion, with the
fees recognized when the opinion is delivered to the client.

Other Revenue Measurement and Recognition Policies
The Corporation did not disclose the value of any open
performance obligations at December 31, 2021, as its
contracts with customers generally have a fixed term that is less
than one year, an open term with a cancellation period that is
less than one year, or provisions that allow the Corporation to
recognize revenue at the amount it has the right to invoice.

Earnings Per Common Share
Earnings per common share (EPS) is computed by dividing net
income allocated to common shareholders by the weighted-
average common shares outstanding, excluding unvested
common shares subject to repurchase or cancellation. Net
income allocated to common shareholders is net income
adjusted for preferred stock dividends including dividends
declared, accretion of discounts on preferred stock including
accelerated accretion when preferred stock is repaid early, and
cumulative dividends related to the current dividend period that
have not been declared as of period end, less income allocated
to participating securities. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing
income allocated to common shareholders plus dividends on
dilutive convertible preferred stock and preferred stock that can
be tendered to exercise warrants, by the weighted-average
common shares outstanding plus amounts representing the
dilutive effect of stock options outstanding, restricted stock,
restricted stock units (RSUs), outstanding warrants and the
dilution resulting from the conversion of convertible preferred
stock, if applicable.
Foreign Currency Translation
Assets, liabilities and operations of foreign branches and
subsidiaries are recorded based on the functional currency of
each entity. When the functional currency of a foreign operation
is the local currency, the assets, liabilities and operations are
translated, for consolidation purposes, from the local currency
to the U.S. dollar reporting currency at period-end rates for
assets and liabilities and generally at average rates for results
of operations. The resulting unrealized gains and losses are
reported as a component of accumulated OCI, net-of-tax. When
the foreign entity9s functional currency is the U.S. dollar, the
resulting remeasurement gains or losses on foreign currency-
denominated assets or liabilities are included in earnings.
Paycheck Protection Program
The Corporation is participating in the Paycheck Protection
Program (PPP), which is a loan program that originated from the
CARES Act and was subsequently expanded by the Paycheck
Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act. The PPP
is designed to provide U.S. small businesses with cash-flow
assistance through loans fully guaranteed by the Small
Business Administration (SBA). If the borrower meets certain
criteria and uses the proceeds towards certain eligible
expenses, the borrower9s obligation to repay the loan can be
forgiven up to the full principal amount of the loan and any
accrued interest. Upon borrower forgiveness, the SBA pays the
Corporation for the principal and accrued interest owed on the
loan. If the full principal of the loan is not forgiven, the loan will
operate according to the original loan terms with the 100
percent SBA guaranty remaining. At December 31, 2021 and
2020, the Corporation had approximately 67,000 and 332,000
PPP loans with a carrying value of $4.7 billion and $22.7 billion.
As compensation for originating the loans, the Corporation
received lender processing fees from the SBA, which were
capitalized, along with the loan origination costs, and are being
amortized over the loans9 contractual lives and recognized as
interest income. Upon forgiveness of a loan and repayment by
the SBA, any unrecognized net capitalized fees and costs
related to the loan are recognized as interest income in that
period.

NOTE 3 Derivatives
Derivative Balances
Derivatives are entered into on behalf of customers, for trading
or to support risk management activities. Derivatives used in
risk management activities include derivatives that may or may
not be designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships.
Derivatives that are not designated in qualifying hedge
accounting relationships are referred to as other risk
management derivatives. For more information on the
Corporation9s derivatives and hedging activities, see Note 1 3
Summary of Significant Accounting Principles. The following
tables present derivative instruments included on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet in derivative assets and liabilities
at December 31, 2021 and 2020. Balances are presented on a

Offsetting of Derivatives
The Corporation enters into International Swaps and Derivatives
Association, Inc. (ISDA) master netting agreements or similar
agreements with substantially all of the Corporation9s derivative
counterparties. Where legally enforceable, these master netting
agreements give the Corporation, in the event of default by the
counterparty, the right to liquidate securities held as collateral
and to offset receivables and payables with the same
counterparty. For purposes of the Consolidated Balance Sheet,
the Corporation offsets derivative assets and liabilities and cash
collateral held with the same counterparty where it has such a
legally enforceable master netting agreement.
The following table presents derivative instruments included
in derivative assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance
Sheet at December 31, 2021 and 2020 by primary risk (e.g.,
interest rate risk) and the platform, where applicable, on which
these derivatives are transacted. Balances are presented on a
gross basis, prior to the application of counterparty and cash
collateral netting. Total gross derivative assets and liabilities
are adjusted on an aggregate basis to take into consideration
the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements,
which include reducing the balance for counterparty netting and
cash collateral received or paid.
For more information on offsetting of securities financing
agreements, see Note 10 3 Securities Financing Agreements,
Short-term Borrowings and Restricted Cash.

and liabilities.
ALM and Risk Management Derivatives
The Corporation9s ALM and risk management activities include
the use of derivatives to mitigate risk to the Corporation
including derivatives designated in qualifying hedge accounting
relationships and derivatives used in other risk management
activities. Interest rate, foreign exchange, equity, commodity
and credit contracts are utilized in the Corporation's ALM and
risk management activities.
The Corporation maintains an overall interest rate risk
management strategy that incorporates the use of interest rate
contracts, which are generally non-leveraged generic interest
rate and basis swaps, options, futures and forwards, to
minimize significant fluctuations in earnings caused by interest
rate volatility. The Corporation9s goal is to manage interest rate
sensitivity and volatility so that movements in interest rates do
not significantly adversely affect earnings or capital. As a result
of interest rate fluctuations, hedged fixed-rate assets and
liabilities appreciate or depreciate in fair value. Gains or losses
on the derivative instruments that are linked to the hedged
fixed-rate assets and liabilities are expected to substantially
offset this unrealized appreciation or depreciation.
Market risk, including interest rate risk, can be substantial in
the mortgage business. Market risk in the mortgage business is
the risk that values of mortgage assets or revenues will be
adversely affected by changes in market conditions such as
interest rate movements. To mitigate the interest rate risk in
mortgage banking production income, the Corporation utilizes
forward loan sale commitments and other derivative
instruments, including purchased options, and certain debt
securities. The Corporation also utilizes derivatives such as
interest rate options, interest rate swaps, forward settlement
contracts and eurodollar futures to hedge certain market risks
of MSRs.
The Corporation uses foreign exchange contracts to manage
the foreign exchange risk associated with certain foreign
currency-denominated assets and liabilities, as well as the
Corporation9s investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries. Exposure to
loss on these contracts will increase or decrease over their
respective lives as currency exchange and interest rates
fluctuate.
The Corporation purchases credit derivatives to manage
credit risk related to certain funded and unfunded credit
exposures. Credit derivatives include credit default swaps
(CDS), total return swaps and swaptions. These derivatives are
recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value with
changes in fair value recorded in other income.
Derivatives Designated as Accounting Hedges
The Corporation uses various types of interest rate and foreign
exchange derivative contracts to protect against changes in the
fair value of its assets and liabilities due to fluctuations in
interest rates and exchange rates (fair value hedges). The
Corporation also uses these types of contracts to protect
against changes in the cash flows of its assets and liabilities,

and other forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges). The Fair Value Hedges

Other Risk Management Derivatives
Other risk management derivatives are used by the Corporation
to reduce certain risk exposures by economically hedging
various assets and liabilities. The table below presents gains
(losses) on these derivatives for 2021, 2020 and 2019. These
gains (losses) are largely offset by the income or expense

Transfers of Financial Assets with Risk Retained
through Derivatives
The Corporation enters into certain transactions involving the
transfer of financial assets that are accounted for as sales
where substantially all of the economic exposure to the
transferred financial assets is retained through derivatives (e.g.,
interest rate and/or credit), but the Corporation does not retain
control over the assets transferred. At December 31, 2021 and
2020, the Corporation had transferred $4.8 billion and $5.2
billion of non-U.S. government-guaranteed mortgage-backed
securities to a third-party trust and retained economic exposure
to the transferred assets through derivative contracts. In
connection with these transfers, the Corporation received gross
cash proceeds of $4.8 billion and $5.2 billion at the transfer
dates. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the fair value of the
transferred securities was $5.0 billion and $5.5 billion.
Sales and Trading Revenue
The Corporation enters into trading derivatives to facilitate client
transactions and to manage risk exposures arising from trading
account assets and liabilities. It is the Corporation9s policy to
include these derivative instruments in its trading activities,
which include derivatives and non-derivative cash instruments.
The resulting risk from these derivatives is managed on a
portfolio basis as part of the Corporation9s Global Markets
business segment. The related sales and trading revenue
generated within Global Markets is recorded in various income
statement line items, including market making and similar
activities and net interest income as well as other revenue
categories.
Sales and trading revenue includes changes in the fair value
and realized gains and losses on the sales of trading and other
assets, net interest income, and fees primarily from
commissions on equity securities. Revenue is generated by the
difference in the client price for an instrument and the price at
which the trading desk can execute the trade in the dealer
market. For equity securities, commissions related to purchases
and sales are recorded in the <Other= column in the Sales and
Trading Revenue table. Changes in the fair value of these
securities are included in market making and similar activities.
For debt securities, revenue, with the exception of interest
associated with the debt securities, is typically included in
market making and similar activities. Unlike commissions for
equity securities, the initial revenue related to broker-dealer
services for debt securities is typically included in the pricing of
the instrument rather than being charged through separate fee
arrangements. Therefore, this revenue is recorded in market
making and similar activities as part of the initial mark to fair
value. For derivatives, the majority of revenue is included in
market making and similar activities. In transactions where the
Corporation acts as agent, which include exchange-traded
futures and options, fees are recorded in other income.
The table below, which includes both derivatives and non-
derivative cash instruments, identifies the amounts in the
respective income statement line items attributable to the
Corporation9s sales and trading revenue in Global Markets,
categorized by primary risk, for 2021, 2020 and 2019. This
table includes debit valuation adjustment (DVA) and funding
valuation adjustment (FVA) gains (losses). Global Markets

Credit Derivatives
The Corporation enters into credit derivatives primarily to
facilitate client transactions and to manage credit risk
exposures. Credit derivatives derive value based on an
underlying third-party referenced obligation or a portfolio of
referenced obligations and generally require the Corporation, as
the seller of credit protection, to make payments to a buyer
upon the occurrence of a predefined credit event. Such credit
events generally include bankruptcy of the referenced credit
entity and failure to pay under the obligation, as well as
acceleration of indebtedness and payment repudiation or
moratorium. For credit derivatives based on a portfolio of
referenced credits or credit indices, the Corporation may not be
required to make payment until a specified amount of loss has

and credit-linked note vehicles. These instruments are primarily
classified as trading securities. The carrying value of these
instruments equals the Corporation9s maximum exposure to
loss. The Corporation is not obligated to make any payments to
the entities under the terms of the securities owned.

Credit-related Contingent Features and Collateral
The Corporation executes the majority of its derivative contracts
in the OTC market with large, international financial institutions,
including broker-dealers and, to a lesser degree, with a variety
of non-financial companies. A significant majority of the
derivative transactions are executed on a daily margin basis.
Therefore, events such as a credit rating downgrade (depending
on the ultimate rating level) or a breach of credit covenants
would typically require an increase in the amount of collateral
required of the counterparty, where applicable, and/or allow the
Corporation to take additional protective measures such as
early termination of all trades. Further, as previously discussed
on page 144, the Corporation enters into legally enforceable
master netting agreements that reduce risk by permitting
closeout and netting of transactions with the same counterparty
upon the occurrence of certain events.
Certain of the Corporation9s derivative contracts contain
credit risk-related contingent features, primarily in the form of
ISDA master netting agreements and credit support
documentation that enhance the creditworthiness of these
instruments compared to other obligations of the respective
counterparty with whom the Corporation has transacted. These
contingent features may be for the benefit of the Corporation as
well as its counterparties with respect to changes in the
Corporation9s creditworthiness and the mark-to-market exposure
under the derivative transactions. At December 31, 2021 and
2020, the Corporation held cash and securities collateral of
$91.4 billion and $96.5 billion and posted cash and securities
collateral of $79.3 billion and $88.6 billion in the normal course
of business under derivative agreements, excluding cross-
product margining agreements where clients are permitted to
margin on a net basis for both derivative and secured financing
arrangements.
In connection with certain OTC derivative contracts and other
trading agreements, the Corporation can be required to provide
additional collateral or to terminate transactions with certain
counterparties in the event of a downgrade of the senior debt
ratings of the Corporation or certain subsidiaries. The amount of
additional collateral required depends on the contract and is
usually a fixed incremental amount and/or the market value of
the exposure.
At December 31, 2021, the amount of collateral, calculated
based on the terms of the contracts, that the Corporation and
certain subsidiaries could be required to post to counterparties
but had not yet posted to counterparties was $2.3 billion,
including $1.4 billion for Bank of America, National Association
(BANA).
Some counterparties are currently able to unilaterally
terminate certain contracts, or the Corporation or certain
subsidiaries may be required to take other action such as find a
suitable replacement or obtain a guarantee. At December 31,
2021 and 2020, the liability recorded for these derivative
contracts was not significant.
The following table presents the amount of additional
collateral that would have been contractually required by

derivative contracts and other trading agreements at
December 31, 2021 if the rating agencies had downgraded their
long-term senior debt ratings for the Corporation or certain
subsidiaries by one incremental notch and by an additional
second incremental notch. The table also presents derivative
liabilities that would be subject to unilateral termination by
counterparties upon downgrade of the Corporation's or certain
subsidiaries' long-term senior debt ratings.

Valuation Adjustments on Derivatives
The Corporation records credit risk valuation adjustments on
derivatives in order to properly reflect the credit quality of the
counterparties and its own credit quality. The Corporation
calculates valuation adjustments on derivatives based on a
modeled expected exposure that incorporates current market
risk factors. The exposure also takes into consideration credit
mitigants such as enforceable master netting agreements and
collateral. CDS spread data is used to estimate the default
probabilities and severities that are applied to the exposures.
Where no observable credit default data is available for
counterparties, the Corporation uses proxies and other market
data to estimate default probabilities and severity.
The table below presents credit valuation adjustment (CVA),
DVA and FVA gains (losses) on derivatives (excluding the effect
of any related hedge activities), which are recorded in market
making and similar activities, for 2021, 2020 and 2019. CVA
gains reduce the cumulative CVA thereby increasing the
derivative assets balance. DVA gains increase the cumulative
DVA thereby decreasing the derivative liabilities balance. CVA
and DVA losses have the opposite impact. FVA gains related to
derivative assets reduce the cumulative FVA thereby increasing
the derivative assets balance. FVA gains related to derivative
liabilities increase the cumulative FVA thereby decreasing the
derivative liabilities balance. FVA losses have the opposite
impact.

Credit Quality Indicators
The Corporation monitors credit quality within its Consumer Real
Estate, Credit Card and Other Consumer, and Commercial
portfolio segments based on primary credit quality indicators.
For more information on the portfolio segments, see Note 1 3
Summary of Significant Accounting Principles. Within the
Consumer Real Estate portfolio segment, the primary credit
quality indicators are refreshed LTV and refreshed Fair Isaac
Corporation (FICO) score. Refreshed LTV measures the carrying
value of the loan as a percentage of the value of the property
securing the loan, refreshed quarterly. Home equity loans are
evaluated using combined loan-to-value (CLTV), which measures
the carrying value of the Corporation9s loan and available line of
credit combined with any outstanding senior liens against the
property as a percentage of the value of the property securing
the loan, refreshed quarterly. FICO score measures the
creditworthiness of the borrower based on the financial
obligations of the borrower and the borrower9s credit history.
FICO scores are typically refreshed quarterly or more frequently.
Certain borrowers (e.g., borrowers that have had debts
discharged in a bankruptcy proceeding) may not have their FICO
scores updated. FICO scores are also a primary credit quality
indicator for the Credit Card and Other Consumer portfolio
segment and the business card portfolio within U.S. small
business commercial. Within the Commercial portfolio segment,
loans are evaluated using the internal classifications of pass
rated or reservable criticized as the primary credit quality
indicators. The term reservable criticized refers to those
commercial loans that are internally classified or listed by the
Corporation as Special Mention, Substandard or Doubtful, which
are asset quality categories defined by regulatory authorities.
These assets have an elevated level of risk and may have a
high probability of default or total loss. Pass rated refers to all
loans not considered reservable criticized. In addition to these
primary credit quality indicators, the Corporation uses other
credit quality indicators for certain types of loans.
The following tables present certain credit quality indicators
for the Corporation's Consumer Real Estate, Credit Card and
Other Consumer, and Commercial portfolio segments by class
of financing receivables and year of origination for term loan
balances at December 31, 2021, including revolving loans that
converted to term loans without an additional credit decision
after origination or through a TDR.

During 2021, commercial credit quality showed signs of
stabilization as the economy continued to recover. Commercial
reservable criticized utilized exposure decreased to $22.4 billion
at December 31, 2021 from $38.7 billion (to 3.91 percent from
7.31 percent of total commercial reservable utilized exposure)
at December 31, 2020, which was broad-based across
industries.

Consumer Real Estate
Modifications of consumer real estate loans are classified as
TDRs when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and
a concession has been granted. Concessions may include
reductions in interest rates, capitalization of past due amounts,
principal and/or interest forbearance, payment extensions,
principal and/or interest forgiveness, or combinations thereof.
Prior to permanently modifying a loan, the Corporation may enter
into trial modifications with certain borrowers under both
government and proprietary programs. Trial modifications
generally represent a three- to four-month period during which
the borrower makes monthly payments under the anticipated
modified payment terms. Upon successful completion of the
trial period, the Corporation and the borrower enter into a
permanent modification. Binding trial modifications are
classified as TDRs when the trial offer is made and continue to
be classified as TDRs regardless of whether the borrower enters
into a permanent modification.
Consumer real estate loans of $306 million that have been
discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy with no change in

repayment terms and not reaffirmed by the borrower were
included in TDRs at December 31, 2021, of which $87 million
were classified as nonperforming and $55 million were loans
fully insured.
At December 31, 2021 and 2020, remaining commitments
to lend additional funds to debtors whose terms have been
modified in a consumer real estate TDR were not significant.
Consumer real estate foreclosed properties totaled $101 million
and $123 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020. The
carrying value of consumer real estate loans, including fully-
insured loans, for which formal foreclosure proceedings were in
process at December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $1.1 billion and
$1.2 billion. During 2021 and 2020, the Corporation
reclassified $64 million and $182 million of consumer real
estate loans, to foreclosed properties or, for properties acquired
upon foreclosure of certain government-guaranteed loans
(principally FHA-insured loans), to other assets. The
reclassifications represent non-cash investing activities and,
accordingly, are not reflected in the Consolidated Statement of
Cash Flows.
The table below presents the December 31, 2021, 2020
and 2019 unpaid principal balance, carrying value, and average
pre- and post-modification interest rates of consumer real estate
loans that were modified in TDRs during 2021, 2020 and 2019.
The following Consumer Real Estate portfolio segment tables
include loans that were initially classified as TDRs during the
period and also loans that had previously been classified as
TDRs and were modified again during the period.

Credit Card and Other Consumer
The Corporation seeks to assist customers who are
experiencing financial difficulty by modifying loans while
ensuring compliance with federal and local laws and guidelines.
Credit card and other consumer loan modifications generally
involve reducing the interest rate on the account, placing the
customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months and
canceling the customer9s available line of credit, all of which are
considered TDRs. The Corporation makes loan modifications
directly with borrowers for debt held only by the Corporation
(internal programs). Additionally, the Corporation makes loan
modifications for borrowers working with third-party renegotiation
agencies that provide solutions to customers9 entire unsecured
debt structures (external programs). The Corporation classifies
other secured consumer loans that have been discharged in
Chapter 7 bankruptcy as TDRs, which are written down to
collateral value and placed on nonaccrual status no later than
the time of discharge.
The table below provides information on the Corporation9s
Credit Card and Other Consumer TDR portfolio including the
December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 unpaid principal balance,
carrying value, and average pre- and post-modification interest
rates of loans that were modified in TDRs during 2021, 2020

payment default during the quarter in which a borrower misses
the second of two consecutive payments. Payment defaults are
one of the factors considered when projecting future cash flows
in the calculation of the allowance for loan and lease losses for
credit card and other consumer. Based on historical experience,
the Corporation estimates that 10 percent of new credit card
TDRs and 18 percent of new direct/indirect consumer TDRs may
be in payment default within 12 months after modification.
Commercial Loans
Modifications of loans to commercial borrowers that are
experiencing financial difficulty are designed to reduce the
Corporation9s loss exposure while providing the borrower with an
opportunity to work through financial difficulties, often to avoid
foreclosure or bankruptcy. Each modification is unique and
reflects the individual circumstances of the borrower.
Modifications that result in a TDR may include extensions of
maturity at a concessionary (below market) rate of interest,
payment forbearances or other actions designed to benefit the
borrower while mitigating the Corporation9s risk exposure.
Reductions in interest rates are rare. Instead, the interest rates
are typically increased, although the increased rate may not
represent a market rate of interest. Infrequently, concessions
may also include principal forgiveness in connection with
foreclosure, short sale or other settlement agreements leading
to termination or sale of the loan.
At the time of restructuring, the loans are remeasured to
reflect the impact, if any, on projected cash flows resulting from
the modified terms. If a portion of the loan is deemed to be
uncollectible, a charge-off may be recorded at the time of
restructuring. Alternatively, a charge-off may have already been
recorded in a previous period such that no charge-off is required
at the time of modification.
During 2021, the carrying value of the Corporation9s
commercial loans that were modified as TDRs was $1.3 billion
compared to $1.2 billion and $1.7 billion for 2020 and 2019. At
December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Corporation had
commitments to lend $283 million, $402 million and $445
million to commercial borrowers whose loans were classified as
TDRs. The balance of commercial TDRs in payment default was
$262 million, $218 million and $207 million at December 31,
2021, 2020 and 2019.
Loans Held-for-sale
The Corporation had LHFS of $15.6 billion and $9.2 billion at
December 31, 2021 and 2020. Cash and non-cash proceeds
from sales and paydowns of loans originally classified as LHFS
were $43.6 billion, $20.1 billion and $30.6 billion for 2021,
2020 and 2019, respectively. Cash used for originations and
purchases of LHFS totaled $37.3 billion, $19.7 billion and
$28.9 billion for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Accrued Interest Receivable
Accrued interest receivable for loans and leases and loans held-
for-sale at December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $2.2 billion and
$2.4 billion and is reported in customer and other receivables
on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Outstanding credit card loan balances include unpaid
principal, interest and fees. Credit card loans are not classified
as nonperforming but are charged off no later than the end of
the month in which the account becomes 180 days past due,
within 60 days after receipt of notification of death or
bankruptcy, or upon confirmation of fraud. During 2021 and
2020, the Corporation reversed $446 million and $512 million
of interest and fee income against the income statement line
item in which it was originally recorded upon charge-off of the
principal balance of the loan.
For the outstanding residential mortgage, home equity,
direct/indirect consumer and commercial loan balances
classified as nonperforming during 2021 and 2020, interest and
fee income reversed at the time the loans were classified as
nonperforming was not significant. For more information on the
Corporation's nonperforming loan policies, see Note 1 3
Summary of Significant Accounting Principles.

Allowance for Credit Losses
On January 1, 2020, the Corporation adopted the new
accounting standard that requires the measurement of the
allowance for credit losses to be based on management9s best
estimate of lifetime ECL inherent in the Corporation9s relevant
financial assets. Upon adoption of the new accounting standard,
the Corporation recorded a $3.3 billion, or 32 percent, increase
in the allowance for credit losses on January 1, 2020, which
was comprised of a net increase of $2.9 billion in the allowance
for loan and lease losses and a $310 million increase in the
reserve for unfunded lending commitments. The net increase in
the allowance for loan and lease losses was primarily driven by
a $3.1 billion increase in credit card as the Corporation now
reserves for the life of these receivables. The increase in the
reserve for unfunded lending commitments included $119
million in the consumer portfolio for the undrawn portion of
HELOCs and $191 million in the commercial portfolio. For more
information on the Corporation's credit loss accounting policies
including the allowance for credit losses see Note 1 3 Summary
of Significant Accounting Principles.
The allowance for credit losses is estimated using
quantitative and qualitative methods that consider a variety of
factors, such as historical loss experience, the current credit
quality of the portfolio and an economic outlook over the life of
the loan. Qualitative reserves cover losses that are expected
but, in the Corporation's assessment, may not be adequately
reflected in the quantitative methods or the economic
assumptions. The Corporation incorporates forward-looking
information through the use of several macroeconomic
scenarios in determining the weighted economic outlook over
the forecasted life of the assets. These scenarios include key
macroeconomic variables such as gross domestic product,
unemployment rate, real estate prices and corporate bond
spreads. The scenarios that are chosen each quarter and the
weighting given to each scenario depend on a variety of factors
including recent economic events, leading economic indicators,
internal and third-party economist views, and industry trends.
The December 31, 2021 estimate for allowance for credit
losses was based on various economic outlooks that included a
baseline scenario, which is derived from consensus estimates,
a downside scenario that assumed a significantly longer period
until full economic recovery, a tail risk scenario similar to the
severely adverse scenario used in stress testing, a scenario to
account for inflationary risk and higher interest rates and an
upside scenario to consider the potential for improvement in the
consensus outlooks. The weighted economic outlook assumes
that the U.S. average unemployment rate will be just above five
percent by the fourth quarter of 2022 and slowly declines to just
under five percent by the fourth quarter of 2023. Additionally, in

this economic outlook, U.S. gross domestic product is
forecasted to grow at 2.1 percent and 1.9 percent year-over-year
in the fourth quarters of 2022 and 2023. For comparison, as of
December 31, 2020, the weighted macroeconomic outlook for
the U.S. average unemployment rate was forecasted at 6.6
percent, 5.5 percent and 5.0 percent in the fourth quarters of
2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively, and the weighted
macroeconomic outlook for U.S. GDP was forecasted to grow at
2.5 percent, 2.4 percent and 2.1 percent year-over-year in the
fourth quarters of 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively. The
allowance for credit losses considered the impact of enacted
government stimulus measures and continued to factor in the
uncertainty resulting from the unprecedented nature of the
current public health crisis and risks that may prevent a full
economic recovery.
While there has been improvement across the U.S.
economy, the Corporation continues to factor into its allowance
for credit losses an estimated impact from higher-risk segments
that included leveraged loans and industries such as travel and
entertainment, which have been adversely impacted by the
effects of the pandemic.
The allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2021 was
$13.8 billion, a decrease of $6.8 billion compared to
December 31, 2020. The decrease in the allowance for credit
losses was primarily driven by improvements in the
macroeconomic outlook and credit quality. The change in the
allowance for credit losses was comprised of a net decrease of
$6.4 billion in the allowance for loan and lease losses and a
$422 million decrease in the reserve for unfunded lending
commitments. The decrease in the allowance for credit losses
was attributed to $342 million in the consumer real estate
portfolio, $2.7 billion in the credit card and other consumer
portfolio, and $3.8 billion in the commercial portfolio. Similarly,
the provision for credit losses improved $15.9 billion to a
benefit of $4.6 billion in 2021 compared to provision expense
of $11.3 billion and $3.6 billion in 2020 and 2019. The benefit
in 2021 was primarily driven by improvements in the
macroeconomic outlook and credit quality.
Outstanding loans and leases excluding loans accounted for
under the fair value option increased $50.1 billion in 2021
driven by commercial loans, which increased $60.4 billion,
excluding small business, primarily driven by Global Markets.
Consumer loans increased $7.0 billion primarily driven by
securities-based lending, partially offset by lower consumer real
estate due to prepayments in a low rate environment.
The changes in the allowance for credit losses, including net
charge-offs and provision for loan and lease losses, are detailed
in the following table.

NOTE 6 Securitizations and Other Variable
Interest Entities
The Corporation utilizes VIEs in the ordinary course of business
to support its own and its customers9 financing and investing
needs. The Corporation routinely securitizes loans and debt
securities using VIEs as a source of funding for the Corporation
and as a means of transferring the economic risk of the loans or
debt securities to third parties. The assets are transferred into a
trust or other securitization vehicle such that the assets are
legally isolated from the creditors of the Corporation and are not
available to satisfy its obligations. These assets can only be
used to settle obligations of the trust or other securitization
vehicle. The Corporation also administers, structures or invests
in other VIEs including CDOs, investment vehicles and other
entities. For more information on the Corporation9s use of VIEs,
see Note 1 3 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles.
The tables in this Note present the assets and liabilities of
consolidated and unconsolidated VIEs at December 31, 2021
and 2020 in situations where the Corporation has continuing
involvement with transferred assets or if the Corporation
otherwise has a variable interest in the VIE. The tables also
present the Corporation9s maximum loss exposure at December
31, 2021 and 2020 resulting from its involvement with
consolidated VIEs and unconsolidated VIEs in which the
Corporation holds a variable interest. The Corporation9s
maximum loss exposure is based on the unlikely event that all
of the assets in the VIEs become worthless and incorporates
not only potential losses associated with assets recorded on
the Consolidated Balance Sheet but also potential losses
associated with off-balance sheet commitments, such as
unfunded liquidity commitments and other contractual
arrangements. The Corporation9s maximum loss exposure does
not include losses previously recognized through write-downs of
assets.
The Corporation invests in ABS issued by third-party VIEs
with which it has no other form of involvement and enters into
certain commercial lending arrangements that may also
incorporate the use of VIEs, for example to hold collateral.
These securities and loans are included in Note 4 3 Securities or
Note 5 3 Outstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance for Credit
Losses. In addition, the Corporation has used VIEs in connection
with its funding activities.
The Corporation did not provide financial support to
consolidated or unconsolidated VIEs during 2021, 2020 and
2019 that it was not previously contractually required to provide,
nor does it intend to do so.
The Corporation had liquidity commitments, including written
put options and collateral value guarantees, with certain
unconsolidated VIEs of $968 million and $929 million at
December 31, 2021 and 2020.
164 Bank of America 2021

First-lien Mortgage Securitizations
As part of its mortgage banking activities, the Corporation
securitizes a portion of the first-lien residential mortgage loans
it originates or purchases from third parties, generally in the
form of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS)
guaranteed by government-sponsored enterprises, FNMA and
FHLMC (collectively the GSEs), or the Government National
Mortgage Association (GNMA) primarily in the case of FHA-
insured and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)-
guaranteed mortgage loans. Securitization usually occurs in
conjunction with or shortly after origination or purchase, and the
Corporation may also securitize loans held in its residential

mortgage portfolio. In addition, the Corporation may, from time
to time, securitize commercial mortgages it originates or
purchases from other entities. The Corporation typically services
the loans it securitizes. Further, the Corporation may retain
beneficial interests in the securitization trusts including senior
and subordinate securities and equity tranches issued by the
trusts. Except as described in Note 12 3 Commitments and
Contingencies, the Corporation does not provide guarantees or
recourse to the securitization trusts other than standard
representations and warranties.
The table below summarizes select information related to
first-lien mortgage securitizations for 2021, 2020 and 2019.

The Corporation may have the option to repurchase delinquent loans out of securitization trusts, which reduces the amount of servicing advances it is required to make. The Corporation may also
repurchase loans from securitization trusts to perform modifications. Repurchased loans include FHA-insured mortgages collateralizing GNMA securities.

166 Bank of America 2021

Home Equity Loans
The Corporation retains interests, primarily senior securities, in
home equity securitization trusts to which it transferred home
equity loans. In addition, the Corporation may be obligated to
provide subordinate funding to the trusts during a rapid
amortization event. This obligation is included in the maximum
loss exposure in the table above. The charges that will
ultimately be recorded as a result of the rapid amortization
events depend on the undrawn portion of the home equity lines
of credit, performance of the loans, the amount of subsequent
draws and the timing of related cash flows.

Credit Card Securitizations
The Corporation securitizes originated and purchased credit card
loans. The Corporation9s continuing involvement with the
securitization trust includes servicing the receivables, retaining
an undivided interest (seller9s interest) in the receivables, and
holding certain retained interests, including subordinate
interests in accrued interest and fees on the securitized
receivables and cash reserve accounts.
During 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Corporation issued new
senior debt securities issued to third-party investors from the
credit card securitization trust of $1.0 billion, $1.0 billion and
$1.3 billion, respectively.
At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Corporation held
subordinate securities issued by the credit card securitization
trust with a notional principal amount of $6.5 billion and $6.8
billion. These securities serve as a form of credit enhancement
to the senior debt securities and have a stated interest rate of
zero percent. During 2021, 2020 and 2019, the credit card
securitization trust issued $161 million, $161 million and $202
million, respectively, of these subordinate securities.

Resecuritization Trusts
The Corporation transfers securities, typically MBS, into
resecuritization VIEs generally at the request of customers
seeking securities with specific characteristics. Generally, there
are no significant ongoing activities performed in a
resecuritization trust, and no single investor has the unilateral
ability to liquidate the trust.

The Corporation resecuritized $28.9 billion, $39.0 billion
and $24.4 billion of securities during 2021, 2020 and 2019,
respectively. Securities transferred into resecuritization VIEs
were measured at fair value with changes in fair value recorded
in market making and similar activities prior to the
resecuritization and, accordingly, no gain or loss on sale was
recorded. Securities received from the resecuritization VIEs were
recognized at their fair value of $2.2 billion, $6.1 billion and
$5.2 billion during 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In 2021
and 2019, substantially all of the securities were classified as
trading account assets. All of the securities received as
resecuritization proceeds during 2020 were classified as trading
account assets. Of the securities received as resecuritization
proceeds during 2020, $2.4 billion, $2.1 billion and $1.7 billion
were classified as trading account assets, debt securities
carried at fair value and HTM securities, respectively.
Substantially all of the trading account securities carried at fair
value were categorized as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.
Municipal Bond Trusts
The Corporation administers municipal bond trusts that hold
highly-rated, long-term, fixed-rate municipal bonds. The trusts
obtain financing by issuing floating-rate trust certificates that
reprice on a weekly or other short-term basis to third-party
investors.
The Corporation9s liquidity commitments to unconsolidated
municipal bond trusts, including those for which the Corporation

Customer VIEs
Customer VIEs include credit-linked, equity-linked and
commodity-linked note VIEs, repackaging VIEs and asset
acquisition VIEs, which are typically created on behalf of
customers who wish to obtain market or credit exposure to a
specific company, index, commodity or financial instrument.
The Corporation9s maximum loss exposure to consolidated
and unconsolidated customer VIEs totaled $2.9 billion and $2.3
billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, including the notional
amount of derivatives to which the Corporation is a
counterparty, net of losses previously recorded, and the
Corporation9s investment, if any, in securities issued by the
VIEs.

Collateralized Debt Obligation VIEs
The Corporation receives fees for structuring CDO VIEs, which
hold diversified pools of fixed-income securities, typically
corporate debt or ABS, which the CDO VIEs fund by issuing
multiple tranches of debt and equity securities. CDOs are
generally managed by third-party portfolio managers. The
Corporation typically transfers assets to these CDOs, holds
securities issued by the CDOs and may be a derivative
counterparty to the CDOs. The Corporation9s maximum loss
exposure to consolidated and unconsolidated CDOs totaled
$235 million and $298 million at December 31, 2021 and

Investment VIEs
The Corporation sponsors, invests in or provides financing,
which may be in connection with the sale of assets, to a variety
of investment VIEs that hold loans, real estate, debt securities
or other financial instruments and are designed to provide the
desired investment profile to investors or the Corporation. At
December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Corporation9s consolidated
investment VIEs had total assets of $1.0 billion and $494
million. The Corporation also held investments in
unconsolidated VIEs with total assets of $7.1 billion and $5.4
billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020. The Corporation9s
maximum loss exposure associated with both consolidated and
unconsolidated investment VIEs totaled $2.0 billion and $1.5
billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020 comprised primarily of
on-balance sheet assets less non-recourse liabilities.

Leveraged Lease Trusts
The Corporation9s net investment in consolidated leveraged
lease trusts totaled $1.5 billion and $1.7 billion at
December 31, 2021 and 2020. The trusts hold long-lived
equipment such as rail cars, power generation and distribution
equipment, and commercial aircraft. The Corporation structures
the trusts and holds a significant residual interest. The net
investment represents the Corporation9s maximum loss
exposure to the trusts in the unlikely event that the leveraged
lease investments become worthless. Debt issued by the
leveraged lease trusts is non-recourse to the Corporation.

Tax Credit VIEs
The Corporation holds investments in unconsolidated limited
partnerships and similar entities that construct, own and
operate affordable housing, wind and solar projects. An
unrelated third party is typically the general partner or managing

member and has control over the significant activities of the VIE.
The Corporation earns a return primarily through the receipt of
tax credits allocated to the projects. The maximum loss
exposure included in the Other VIEs table was $25.7 billion and
$22.0 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020. The
Corporation9s risk of loss is generally mitigated by policies
requiring that the project qualify for the expected tax credits
prior to making its investment.
The Corporation9s investments in affordable housing
partnerships, which are reported in other assets on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet, totaled $12.6 billion and $11.2
billion, including unfunded commitments to provide capital
contributions of $5.8 billion and $5.0 billion, at December 31,
2021 and 2020. The unfunded commitments are expected to
be paid over the next five years. During 2021, 2020 and 2019,
the Corporation recognized tax credits and other tax benefits
from investments in affordable housing partnerships of $1.3
billion, $1.2 billion and $1.0 billion and reported pretax losses
in other income of $1.1 billion, $1.0 billion and $882 million,
respectively. These tax credits are recognized as part of the
Corporation9s annual effective tax rate used to determine tax
expense in a given quarter. The Corporation may be asked to
invest additional amounts to support a troubled affordable
housing project. Such additional investments have not been and
are not expected to be significant.

determined there was no impairment. For more information on
the use of qualitative assessments, see Note 1 3 Summary of
Significant Accounting Principles.
Intangible Assets
At both December 31, 2021 and 2020, the net carrying value of
intangible assets was $2.2 billion. At both December 31, 2021
and 2020, intangible assets included $1.6 billion of intangible
assets associated with trade names, substantially all of which
had an indefinite life and, accordingly, are not being amortized.
Amortization of intangibles expense was $76 million, $95
million and $112 million for 2021, 2020 and 2019.

NOTE 8 Leases
The Corporation enters into both lessor and lessee
arrangements. For more information on lease accounting, see
Note 1 3 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and on
lease financing receivables, see Note 5 3 Outstanding Loans and
Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses.

Lessor Arrangements
The Corporation9s lessor arrangements primarily consist of
operating, sales-type and direct financing leases for equipment.
Lease agreements may include options to renew and for the
lessee to purchase the leased equipment at the end of the
lease term.
The table below presents the net investment in sales-type
and direct financing leases at December 31, 2021 and 2020.

Lessee Arrangements
The Corporation's lessee arrangements predominantly consist
of operating leases for premises and equipment; the
Corporation's financing leases are not significant.
Lease terms may contain renewal and extension options and
early termination features. Generally, these options do not
impact the lease term because the Corporation is not
reasonably certain that it will exercise the options.

NOTE 10 Securities Financing Agreements,

Short-term Borrowings and Restricted Cash
The Corporation enters into securities financing agreements to
accommodate customers (also referred to as <matched-book
transactions=), obtain securities to cover short positions and
finance inventory positions. The Corporation elects to account
for certain securities financing agreements and short-term
borrowings under the fair value option. For more information on
the fair value option, see Note 21 3 Fair Value Option.

Offsetting of Securities Financing Agreements
Substantially all of the Corporation9s securities financing
activities are transacted under legally enforceable master
repurchase agreements or legally enforceable master securities
lending agreements that give the Corporation, in the event of

default by the counterparty, the right to liquidate securities held
and to offset receivables and payables with the same
counterparty. The Corporation offsets securities financing
transactions with the same counterparty on the Consolidated
Balance Sheet where it has such a legally enforceable master
netting agreement and the transactions have the same maturity
date.
The Securities Financing Agreements table presents
securities financing agreements included on the Consolidated
Balance Sheet in federal funds sold and securities borrowed or
purchased under agreements to resell, and in federal funds
purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to
repurchase at December 31, 2021 and 2020. Balances are
presented on a gross basis, prior to the application of
counterparty netting. Gross assets and liabilities are adjusted
on an aggregate basis to take into consideration the effects of
legally enforceable master netting agreements. For more
information on the offsetting of derivatives, see Note 3 3

Under repurchase agreements, the Corporation is required to
post collateral with a market value equal to or in excess of the
principal amount borrowed. For securities loaned transactions,
the Corporation receives collateral in the form of cash, letters of
credit or other securities. To determine whether the market
value of the underlying collateral remains sufficient, collateral is
generally valued daily, and the Corporation may be required to
deposit additional collateral or may receive or return collateral
pledged when appropriate. Repurchase agreements and
securities loaned transactions are generally either overnight,
continuous (i.e., no stated term) or short-term. The Corporation
manages liquidity risks related to these agreements by sourcing
funding from a diverse group of counterparties, providing a
range of securities collateral and pursuing longer durations,
when appropriate.
Short-term Bank Notes
Bank of America, N.A. maintains a global program to offer up to
a maximum of $75.0 billion outstanding at any one time, of
bank notes with fixed or floating rates and maturities of at least

outstanding under this program totaled $1.8 billion and $3.9
billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020. These short-term bank
notes, along with Federal Home Loan Bank advances, U.S.
Treasury tax and loan notes, and term federal funds purchased,
are included in short-term borrowings on the Consolidated
Balance Sheet.
Restricted Cash
At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Corporation held
restricted cash included within cash and cash equivalents on
the Consolidated Balance Sheet of $5.9 billion and $7.0 billion,
predominantly related to cash segregated in compliance with
securities regulations and cash held on deposit with central
banks to meet reserve requirements.

percent and 0.75 percent, respectively, at December 31, 2021,
and 3.02 percent, 3.29 percent and 0.71 percent, respectively,
at December 31, 2020. The Corporation9s ALM activities
maintain an overall interest rate risk management strategy that
incorporates the use of interest rate contracts to manage
fluctuations in earnings caused by interest rate volatility. The
Corporation9s goal is to manage interest rate sensitivity so that
movements in interest rates do not have a significantly adverse
effect on earnings and capital. The weighted-average rates are
the contractual interest rates on the debt and do not reflect the
impacts of derivative transactions.
The following table shows the carrying value for aggregate
annual contractual maturities of long-term debt as of
December 31, 2021. Included in the table are certain structured
notes issued by the Corporation that contain provisions whereby
the borrowings are redeemable at the option of the holder (put
options) at specified dates prior to maturity. Other structured
notes have coupon or repayment terms linked to the
performance of debt or equity securities, indices, currencies or
commodities, and the maturity may be accelerated based on the
value of a referenced index or security. In both cases, the
Corporation or a subsidiary may be required to settle the
obligation for cash or other securities prior to the contractual
maturity date. These borrowings are reflected in the table as
maturing at their contractual maturity date.

NOTE 12 Commitments and Contingencies
In the normal course of business, the Corporation enters into a
number of off-balance sheet commitments. These commitments
expose the Corporation to varying degrees of credit and market
risk and are subject to the same credit and market risk
limitation reviews as those instruments recorded on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Credit Extension Commitments
The Corporation enters into commitments to extend credit such
as loan commitments, SBLCs and commercial letters of credit
to meet the financing needs of its customers. The following
table includes the notional amount of unfunded legally binding
lending commitments net of amounts distributed (i.e.,
syndicated or participated) to other financial institutions. The
distributed amounts were $10.7 billion and $10.5 billion at
December 31, 2021 and 2020. The carrying value of the
Corporation9s credit extension commitments at December 31,
2021 and 2020, excluding commitments accounted for under
the fair value option, was $1.5 billion and $1.9 billion, which
predominantly related to the reserve for unfunded lending
commitments. The carrying value of these commitments is
classified in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Legally binding commitments to extend credit generally have
specified rates and maturities. Certain of these commitments
have adverse change clauses that help to protect the
Corporation against deterioration in the borrower9s ability to pay.
The following table includes the notional amount of
commitments of $4.8 billion and $4.0 billion at December 31,
2021 and 2020 that are accounted for under the fair value
option. However, the table excludes the cumulative net fair
value for these commitments of $97 million and $99 million at
December 31, 2021 and 2020, which is classified in accrued
expenses and other liabilities. For more information regarding
the Corporation9s loan commitments accounted for under the
fair value option, see Note 21 3 Fair Value Option.

Other Commitments
At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Corporation had
commitments to purchase loans (e.g., residential mortgage and
commercial real estate) of $181 million and $93 million, which
upon settlement will be included in trading account assets,
loans or LHFS, and commitments to purchase commercial loans
of $518 million and $645 million, which upon settlement will be
included in trading account assets.
At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Corporation had
commitments to purchase commodities, primarily liquefied
natural gas, of $949 million and $582 million, which upon
settlement will be included in trading account assets.
At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Corporation had
commitments to enter into resale and forward-dated resale and
securities borrowing agreements of $92.0 billion and $66.5
billion, and commitments to enter into forward-dated repurchase
and securities lending agreements of $32.6 billion and $32.1
billion. These commitments generally expire within the next 12
months.
At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Corporation had a
commitment to originate or purchase up to $4.0 billion and
$3.9 billion on a rolling 12-month basis, of auto loans and
leases from a strategic partner. This commitment extends
through November 2026 and can be terminated with 12 months
prior notice.
At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Corporation had
unfunded equity investment commitments of $395 million and
$213 million.
Other Guarantees
Bank-owned Life Insurance Book Value Protection
The Corporation sells products that offer book value protection
to insurance carriers who offer group life insurance policies to
corporations, primarily banks. At December 31, 2021 and
174 Bank of America 2021
2020, the notional amount of these guarantees totaled $6.3
billion and $7.1 billion. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the
Corporation9s maximum exposure related to these guarantees
totaled $928 million and $1.1 billion, with estimated maturity
dates between 2033 and 2039.
Indemnifications
In the ordinary course of business, the Corporation enters into
various agreements that contain indemnifications, such as tax
indemnifications, whereupon payment may become due if
certain external events occur, such as a change in tax law. The
indemnification clauses are often standard contractual terms
and were entered into in the normal course of business based
on an assessment that the risk of loss would be remote. These
agreements typically contain an early termination clause that
permits the Corporation to exit the agreement upon these
events. The maximum potential future payment under
indemnification agreements is difficult to assess for several
reasons, including the occurrence of an external event, the
inability to predict future changes in tax and other laws, the
difficulty in determining how such laws would apply to parties in
contracts, the absence of exposure limits contained in standard
contract language and the timing of any early termination
clauses. Historically, any payments made under these
guarantees have been de minimis. The Corporation has
assessed the probability of making such payments in the future
as remote.
Merchant Services
Prior to July 1, 2020, a significant portion of the Corporation's
merchant processing activity was performed by a joint venture in
which the Corporation held a 49 percent ownership interest.
Effective July 1, 2020, the Corporation received its share of the
joint venture's merchant contracts and began performing
merchant processing services for these merchants.

The Corporation in its role as merchant acquirer or as a
sponsor of other merchant acquirers may be held liable for any
reversed charges that cannot be collected from the merchants,
due to, among other things, merchant fraud or insolvency. If
charges are properly reversed after a purchase and cannot be
collected from either the merchants or merchant acquirers, the
Corporation may be held liable for these reversed charges. The
ability to reverse a charge is primarily governed by the
applicable regulatory and card network rules, which include, but
are not limited to, the type of charge, type of payment used and
time limits. The total amount of transactions processed for the
preceding six-month period, which was $476.2 billion, is an
estimate of the Corporation9s maximum potential exposure as
of December 31, 2021. The Corporation9s risk in this area
primarily relates to circumstances where a cardholder has
purchased goods or services for future delivery. The Corporation
mitigates this risk by requiring cash deposits, guarantees,
letters of credit or other types of collateral from certain
merchants. The Corporation9s reserves for contingent losses
and the losses incurred related to the merchant processing
activity were not significant. The Corporation continues to
monitor its exposure in this area due to the potential economic
impacts of the pandemic.

Exchange and Clearing House Member Guarantees
The Corporation is a member of various securities and derivative
exchanges and clearinghouses, both in the U.S. and other
countries. As a member, the Corporation may be required to pay
a pro-rata share of the losses incurred by some of these
organizations as a result of another member default and under
other loss scenarios. The Corporation9s potential obligations
may be limited to its membership interests in such exchanges
and clearinghouses, to the amount (or multiple) of the
Corporation9s contribution to the guarantee fund or, in limited
instances, to the full pro-rata share of the residual losses after
applying the guarantee fund. The Corporation9s maximum
potential exposure under these membership agreements is
difficult to estimate; however, the Corporation has assessed the
probability of making any such payments as remote.

Prime Brokerage and Securities Clearing Services
In connection with its prime brokerage and clearing businesses,
the Corporation performs securities clearance and settlement
services with other brokerage firms and clearinghouses on
behalf of its clients. Under these arrangements, the Corporation
stands ready to meet the obligations of its clients with respect
to securities transactions. The Corporation9s obligations in this
respect are secured by the assets in the clients9 accounts and
the accounts of their customers as well as by any proceeds
received from the transactions cleared and settled by the
Corporation on behalf of clients or their customers. The
Corporation9s maximum potential exposure under these
arrangements is difficult to estimate; however, the potential for
the Corporation to incur material losses pursuant to these
arrangements is remote.

Fixed Income Clearing Corporation Sponsored Member

Repo Program
The Corporation acts as a sponsoring member in a repo
program whereby the Corporation clears certain eligible resale
and repurchase agreements through the Government Securities
Division of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation on behalf of
clients that are sponsored members in accordance with the
Fixed Income Clearing Corporation9s rules. As part of this
program, the Corporation guarantees the payment and

performance of its sponsored members to the Fixed Income
Clearing Corporation. The Corporation9s guarantee obligation is
secured by a security interest in cash or high-quality securities
collateral placed by clients with the clearinghouse and therefore,
the potential for the Corporation to incur significant losses
under this arrangement is remote. The Corporation9s maximum
potential exposure, without taking into consideration the related
collateral, was $42.0 billion and $22.5 billion at December 31,
2021 and 2020.
Other Guarantees
In the normal course of business, the Corporation periodically
guarantees the obligations of its affiliates in a variety of
transactions including ISDA-related transactions and non-ISDA
related transactions such as commodities trading, repurchase
agreements, prime brokerage agreements and other
transactions.
Guarantees of Certain Long-term Debt
The Corporation, as the parent company, fully and
unconditionally guarantees the securities issued by BofA
Finance LLC, a consolidated finance subsidiary of the
Corporation, and effectively provides for the full and
unconditional guarantee of trust securities issued by certain
statutory trust companies that are 100 percent owned finance
subsidiaries of the Corporation.
Representations and Warranties Obligations and
Corporate Guarantees
The Corporation securitizes first-lien residential mortgage loans
generally in the form of RMBS guaranteed by the GSEs or by
GNMA in the case of FHA-insured, VA-guaranteed and Rural
Housing Service-guaranteed mortgage loans, and sells pools of
first-lien residential mortgage loans in the form of whole loans.
In addition, in prior years, legacy companies and certain
subsidiaries sold pools of first-lien residential mortgage loans
and home equity loans as private-label securitizations or in the
form of whole loans. In connection with these transactions, the
Corporation or certain of its subsidiaries or legacy companies
make and have made various representations and warranties.
Breaches of these representations and warranties have resulted
in and may continue to result in the requirement to repurchase
mortgage loans or to otherwise make whole or provide
indemnification or other remedies to sponsors, investors,
securitization trusts, guarantors, insurers or other parties
(collectively, repurchases).
Unresolved Repurchase Claims
Unresolved representations and warranties repurchase claims
represent the notional amount of repurchase claims made by
counterparties, typically the outstanding principal balance or the
unpaid principal balance at the time of default. In the case of
first-lien mortgages, the claim amount is often significantly
greater than the expected loss amount due to the benefit of
collateral and, in some cases, mortgage insurance or mortgage
guarantee payments.
The notional amount of unresolved repurchase claims at
December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $8.4 billion and $8.5
billion. These balances included $2.8 billion and $2.9 billion at
December 31, 2021 and 2020 of claims related to loans in
specific private-label securitization groups or tranches where the
Corporation owns substantially all of the outstanding securities
or will otherwise realize the benefit of any repurchase claims
paid.
Bank of America 2021 175
During 2021, the Corporation received $49 million in new
repurchase claims that were not time-barred. During 2021,
$141 million in claims were resolved.

Reserve and Related Provision
The reserve for representations and warranties obligations and
corporate guarantees was $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion at
December 31, 2021 and 2020 and is included in accrued
expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance
Sheet, and the related provision is included in other income in
the Consolidated Statement of Income. The representations and
warranties reserve represents the Corporation9s best estimate
of probable incurred losses, is based on its experience in
previous negotiations, and is subject to judgment, a variety of
assumptions and known or unknown uncertainties. Future
representations and warranties losses may occur in excess of
the amounts recorded for these exposures; however, the
Corporation does not expect such amounts to be material to the
Corporation's financial condition and liquidity. See Litigation and
Regulatory Matters below for the Corporation's combined range
of possible loss in excess of the reserve for representations
and warranties and the accrued liability for litigation.

Litigation and Regulatory Matters

In the ordinary course of business, the Corporation and its
subsidiaries are routinely defendants in or parties to many
pending and threatened legal, regulatory and governmental
actions and proceedings. In view of the inherent difficulty of
predicting the outcome of such matters, particularly where the
claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages or where
the matters present novel legal theories or involve a large
number of parties, the Corporation generally cannot predict the
eventual outcome of the pending matters, timing of the ultimate
resolution of these matters, or eventual loss, fines or penalties
related to each pending matter.
As a matter develops, the Corporation, in conjunction with
any outside counsel handling the matter, evaluates whether
such matter presents a loss contingency that is probable and
estimable, and, for the matters described below whether a loss
in excess of any accrued liability is reasonably possible in future
periods. Once the loss contingency is deemed to be both
probable and estimable, the Corporation will establish an
accrued liability and record a corresponding amount of litigation-
related expense. The Corporation continues to monitor the
matter for further developments that could affect the amount of
the accrued liability that has been previously established.
Excluding expenses of internal and external legal service
providers, litigation-related expense of $164 million and
$823 million was recognized in 2021 and 2020.
For any matter disclosed in this Note for which a loss in
future periods is reasonably possible and estimable (whether in
excess of an accrued liability or where there is no accrued
liability) and for representations and warranties exposures, the
Corporation9s estimated range of possible loss is $0 to $1.0
billion in excess of the accrued liability, if any, as of
December 31, 2021.
The accrued liability and estimated range of possible loss
are based upon currently available information and subject to
significant judgment, a variety of assumptions and known and
unknown uncertainties. The matters underlying the accrued
liability and estimated range of possible loss are unpredictable
and may change from time to time, and actual losses may vary
significantly from the current estimate and accrual. The

estimated range of possible loss does not represent the
Corporation9s maximum loss exposure.
Information is provided below regarding the nature of the
litigation and, where specified, associated claimed damages.
Based on current knowledge, and taking into account accrued
liabilities, management does not believe that loss contingencies
arising from pending matters, including the matters described
below, will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated
financial condition or liquidity of the Corporation. However, in
light of the significant judgment, variety of assumptions and
uncertainties involved in these matters, some of which are
beyond the Corporation9s control, and the very large or
indeterminate damages sought in some of these matters, an
adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be
material to the Corporation9s business or results of operations
for any particular reporting period, or cause significant
reputational harm.
Ambac Bond Insurance Litigation
Ambac Assurance Corporation and the Segregated Account of
Ambac Assurance Corporation (together, Ambac) have filed four
separate lawsuits against the Corporation and its subsidiaries
relating to bond insurance policies Ambac provided on certain
securitized pools of HELOCs, first-lien subprime home equity
loans, fixed-rate second-lien mortgage loans and negative
amortization pay-option adjustable-rate mortgage loans. Ambac
alleges that they have paid or will pay claims as a result of
defaults in the underlying loans and asserts that the defendants
misrepresented the characteristics of the underlying loans and/
or breached certain contractual representations and warranties
regarding the underwriting and servicing of the loans. In those
actions where the Corporation is named as a defendant, Ambac
contends the Corporation is liable on successor and vicarious
liability theories. These actions are at various procedural stages
with material developments provided below.
Ambac v. Countrywide I
Ambac named the Corporation and several Countrywide entities
as defendants in an action filed on September 28, 2010 in New
York Supreme Court asserting claims for fraudulent inducement
as well as breach of contract and seeking damages in excess of
$2.2 billion, plus punitive damages. The Supreme Court
dismissed Ambac9s fraudulent inducement claim, and on May
11, 2021, the First Department, a New York State appellate
court (First Department), affirmed the dismissal. The Supreme
Court has scheduled a non-jury trial for September 7, 2022 on
the contract claim that remains.
Ambac v. Countrywide II
On December 30, 2014, Ambac filed a complaint in New York
Supreme Court against the same defendants, claiming
fraudulent inducement against Countrywide, and successor and
vicarious liability against the Corporation, while seeking
damages in excess of $600 million, plus punitive damages.
Ambac v. Countrywide IV
On July 21, 2015, Ambac filed an action in New York Supreme
Court against Countrywide asserting the same claims for
fraudulent inducement that Ambac asserted in the now
dismissed Ambac v. Countrywide III. The complaint seeks
damages in excess of $350 million, plus punitive damages. On
December 8, 2020, the New York Supreme Court dismissed
Ambac9s complaint. On February 8, 2022, the First Department
affirmed the dismissal.
176 Bank of America 2021
Ambac v. First Franklin
On April 16, 2012, Ambac filed an action against BANA, First
Franklin and various Merrill Lynch entities, including Merrill
Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, in New York
Supreme Court relating to guaranty insurance Ambac provided
on a First Franklin securitization sponsored by Merrill Lynch. The
complaint alleges fraudulent inducement and breach of contract,
including breach of contract claims against BANA based upon its
servicing of the loans in the securitization. Ambac seeks as
damages hundreds of millions of dollars that Ambac alleges it
has paid or will pay in claims.

Deposit Insurance Assessment
On January 9, 2017, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
(FDIC) filed suit against BANA in the U.S. District Court for the
District of Columbia alleging failure to pay a December 15,
2016 invoice for additional deposit insurance assessments and
interest in the amount of $542 million for the quarters ending
June 30, 2013 through December 31, 2014.
On April 7, 2017, the FDIC amended its complaint to add a
claim for additional deposit insurance and interest in the
amount of $583 million for the quarters ending March 31, 2012
through March 31, 2013. The FDIC asserts these claims based
on BANA9s alleged underreporting of counterparty exposures
that resulted in underpayment of assessments for those
quarters and its Enforcement Section is also conducting a
parallel investigation related to the same alleged reporting error.
BANA disagrees with the FDIC9s interpretation of the regulations
as they existed during the relevant time period and is defending
itself against the FDIC9s claims. Pending final resolution, BANA
has pledged security satisfactory to the FDIC related to the
disputed additional assessment amounts. On March 27, 2018,
the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia denied
BANA9s partial motion to dismiss certain of the FDIC9s claims.

LIBOR
The Corporation, BANA and certain Merrill Lynch entities have
been named as defendants along with most of the other LIBOR
panel banks in a number of individual and putative class actions
by persons alleging they sustained losses on U.S. dollar LIBOR-
based financial instruments as a result of collusion or
manipulation by defendants regarding the setting of U.S. dollar
LIBOR. Plaintiffs assert a variety of claims, including antitrust,
Commodity Exchange Act, Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations (RICO), Securities Exchange Act of 1934, common
law fraud and breach of contract claims, and seek
compensatory, treble and punitive damages, and injunctive
relief. All but one of the cases naming the Corporation and its
affiliates relating to U.S. dollar LIBOR are pending in the U.S.
District Court for the Southern District of New York (<District
Court=). The District Court has dismissed all RICO claims, and
dismissed all manipulation claims against Bank of America
entities based on alleged trader conduct. The District Court has
also substantially limited the scope of antitrust, Commodity
Exchange Act and various other claims, including by dismissing
in their entirety certain individual and putative class plaintiffs9
antitrust claims for lack of standing. On December 30, 2021,
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the
dismissal of these antitrust claims for lack of standing. Certain
individual and putative class actions remain pending against the
Corporation, BANA and certain Merrill Lynch entities. On
February 28, 2018, the District Court granted certification of a

class of persons that purchased OTC swaps and notes that
referenced U.S. dollar LIBOR from one of the U.S. dollar LIBOR
panel banks, limited to claims under Section 1 of the Sherman
Act.
U.S. Bank - Harborview and SURF/OWNIT Repurchase
Litigation
Beginning in 2011, U.S. Bank, National Association (U.S. Bank),
as trustee for the HarborView Mortgage Loan Trust 2005-10 and
various SURF/OWNIT RMBS trusts filed complaints against the
Corporation, Countrywide entities, Merrill Lynch entities and
other affiliates in New York Supreme Court alleging breaches of
representations and warranties. The defendants and certain
certificate-holders in the trusts agreed to settle the respective
matters in amounts not material to the Corporation, subject to
acceptance by U.S. Bank. The litigations have been stayed
pending finalization of the settlements.

programs and dividends during 2020 and the first half of 2021.
Those restrictions ended as of July 1, 2021 for large banks,
including the Corporation, and large banks returned to the
normal restrictions under the Federal Reserve9s stress capital
buffer (SCB) framework.
During 2021, in connection with employee stock plans, the
Corporation issued 68 million shares of its common stock and,
to satisfy tax withholding obligations, repurchased 26 million
shares of its common stock. At December 31, 2021, the
Corporation had reserved 562 million unissued shares of
common stock for future issuances under employee stock
plans, convertible notes and preferred stock.

The cash dividends declared on preferred stock were $1.4
billion in each of 2021, 2020 and 2019.

restrictions in the event the Corporation fails to declare and pay
full dividends.
On January 25, 2022, the Corporation issued 70,000 shares
of 4.375% Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series RR for
$1.8 billion. The Series RR preferred stock has a liquidation

On January 31, 2022, the Corporation issued 28,000 shares
of 4.75% Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series SS for
$700 million. The Series SS preferred stock has a liquidation

full dividends.
In 2021, the Corporation fully redeemed Series CC, Series
EE and Series T preferred stock at their liquidation preference
values for a total of $2.0 billion.
All series of preferred stock in the Preferred Stock Summary
table have a par value of $0.01 per share, are not subject to
the operation of a sinking fund, have no participation rights, and
with the exception of the Series L Preferred Stock, are not
convertible. The holders of the Series B Preferred Stock and
Series 1 through 5 Preferred Stock have general voting rights
and vote together with the common stock. The holders of the
other series included in the table have no general voting rights.
All outstanding series of preferred stock of the Corporation have
preference over the Corporation9s common stock with respect to
the payment of dividends and distribution of the Corporation9s
assets in the event of a liquidation or dissolution. With the
exception of the Series B, F and G Preferred Stock, if any
dividend payable on these series is in arrears for three or more
semi-annual or six or more quarterly dividend periods, as
applicable (whether consecutive or not), the holders of these
series and any other class or series of preferred stock ranking
equally as to payment of dividends and upon which equivalent
voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable (voting as
a single class) will be entitled to vote for the election of two
additional directors. These voting rights terminate when the
Corporation has paid in full dividends on these series for at
least two semi-annual or four quarterly dividend periods, as
applicable, following the dividend arrearage.
The 7.25% Non-Cumulative Perpetual Convertible Preferred
Stock, Series L (Series L Preferred Stock) does not have early
redemption/call rights. Each share of the Series L Preferred
Stock may be converted at any time, at the option of the holder,
into 20 shares of the Corporation9s common stock plus cash in
lieu of fractional shares. The Corporation may cause some or all
of the Series L Preferred Stock, at its option, at any time or from
time to time, to be converted into shares of common stock at
the then-applicable conversion rate if, for 20 trading days during
any period of 30 consecutive trading days, the closing price of
common stock exceeds 130 percent of the then-applicable
conversion price of the Series L Preferred Stock. If a conversion
of Series L Preferred Stock occurs at the option of the holder,
subsequent to a dividend record date but prior to the dividend
payment date, the Corporation will still pay any accrued
dividends payable.

For 2021, 2020 and 2019, 62 million average dilutive
potential common shares associated with the Series L preferred
stock were not included in the diluted share count because the
result would have been antidilutive under the <if-converted=
method. For 2019, average warrants to purchase three million
shares of common stock, were included in the diluted EPS
calculation under the treasury stock method. Substantially all of
these warrants were exercised on or before their expiration date

NOTE 16 Regulatory Requirements and

Restrictions

The Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency
(OCC) and FDIC (collectively, U.S. banking regulators) jointly
establish regulatory capital adequacy rules, including Basel 3,
for U.S. banking organizations. As a financial holding company,
the Corporation is subject to capital adequacy rules issued by
the Federal Reserve. The Corporation9s banking entity affiliates
are subject to capital adequacy rules issued by the OCC.

The Corporation and its primary banking entity affiliate,
BANA, are Advanced approaches institutions under Basel 3. As
Advanced approaches institutions, the Corporation and its
banking entity affiliates are required to report regulatory risk-
based capital ratios and risk-weighted assets under both the
Standardized and Advanced approaches. The approach that
yields the lower ratio is used to assess capital adequacy,
including under the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework.
The Corporation is required to maintain a minimum
supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) of 3.0 percent plus a
leverage buffer of 2.0 percent in order to avoid certain
restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus
payments. The Corporation9s insured depository institution
subsidiaries are required to maintain a minimum 6.0 percent
SLR to be considered well capitalized under the PCA framework.
The table below presents capital ratios and related
information in accordance with Basel 3 Standardized and
Advanced approaches as measured at December 31, 2021 and
2020 for the Corporation and BANA.

(1) (^) As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, capital ratios are calculated using the regulatory capital rule that allows a five-year transition period related to the adoption of the CECL accounting standard.
(2) (^) The capital conservation buffer and global systemically important bank (G-SIB) surcharge were 2.5 percent at both December 31, 2021 and 2020. At December 31, 2021 and 2020 the
Corporation's stress capital buffer of 2.5 percent was applied in place of the capital conservation buffer under the Standardized approach. The countercyclical capital buffer for both periods was
zero. The CET1 capital regulatory minimum is the sum of the CET1 capital ratio minimum of 4.5 percent, the Corporation9s G-SIB surcharge of 2.5 percent and the Corporation9s SCB or the capital
(3) conservation^ buffer,^ as^ applicable,^ of^ 2.5^ percent.^ The^ SLR^ regulatory^ minimum^ includes^ a^ leverage^ buffer^ of^ 2.0^ percent.^
Risk-based capital regulatory minimums at December 31, 2021 and 2020 are the minimum ratios under Basel 3, including a capital conservation buffer of 2.5 percent. The regulatory minimums
(4) for^ the^ leverage^ ratios^ as^ of^ both^ period^ ends^ are^ the^ percent^ required^ to^ be^ considered^ well^ capitalized^ under^ the^ PCA^ framework.^
Total capital under the Advanced approaches differs from the Standardized approach due to differences in the amount permitted in Tier 2 capital related to the qualifying allowance for credit
(5) losses.^
(6) Reflects^ total^ average^ assets^ adjusted^ for^ certain^ Tier^1 capital^ deductions.^
Supplementary leverage exposure for the Corporation at December 31, 2020 reflects the temporary exclusion of U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks. The temporary

The capital adequacy rules issued by the U.S. banking
regulators require institutions to meet the established
minimums outlined in the table above. Failure to meet the
minimum requirements can lead to certain mandatory and
discretionary actions by regulators that could have a material
adverse impact on the Corporation9s financial position. At
December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Corporation and its banking
entity affiliates were well capitalized.
Due to uncertainty from the pandemic, the Federal Reserve
imposed various restrictions on share repurchase programs and
dividends during 2020 and the first half of 2021. In conjunction
with its release of 2021 CCAR supervisory stress test results,
the Federal Reserve announced those restrictions would end as
of July 1, 2021 for large banks, including the Corporation, and
large banks would be subject to the normal restrictions under
the Federal Reserve9s SCB framework. For more information,
see Note 13 3 Shareholders9 Equity.

Other Regulatory Matters

The Federal Reserve requires the Corporation9s bank
subsidiaries to maintain reserve requirements based on a
percentage of certain deposit liabilities. The average daily
reserve balance requirements, in excess of vault cash,
maintained by the Corporation with the Federal Reserve Bank
were $0 for 2021 and $3.8 billion for 2020. At December 31,
2021 and 2020, the Corporation had cash and cash
equivalents in the amount of $4.0 billion and $4.9 billion, and
securities with a fair value of $10.6 billion and $16.8 billion
that were segregated in compliance with securities regulations.
Cash held on deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank to meet
reserve requirements and cash and cash equivalents
segregated in compliance with securities regulations are
components of restricted cash. For more information, see Note
10 3 Securities Financing Agreements, Short-term Borrowings and
Restricted Cash. In addition, at December 31, 2021 and 2020,
the Corporation had cash deposited with clearing organizations
of $28.6 billion and $10.9 billion primarily recorded in other
assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Bank Subsidiary Distributions
The primary sources of funds for cash distributions by the
Corporation to its shareholders are capital distributions received
from its bank subsidiaries, BANA and Bank of America
California, N.A. In 2021, the Corporation received dividends of
$15.6 billion from BANA and $29 million from Bank of America
California, N.A.
The amount of dividends that a subsidiary bank may declare
in a calendar year without OCC approval is the subsidiary bank9s
net profits for that year combined with its retained net profits for
the preceding two years. Retained net profits, as defined by the
OCC, consist of net income less dividends declared during the
period. In 2022, BANA can declare and pay dividends of
approximately $14.7 billion to the Corporation plus an additional
amount equal to its retained net profits for 2022 up to the date
of any such dividend declaration. Bank of America California,
N.A. can pay dividends of $234 million in 2022 plus an
additional amount equal to its retained net profits for 2022 up
to the date of any such dividend declaration.

NOTE 17 Employee Benefit Plans

Pension and Postretirement Plans
The Corporation sponsors a qualified noncontributory trusteed
pension plan (Qualified Pension Plan), a number of
noncontributory nonqualified pension plans and postretirement
health and life plans that cover eligible employees. Non-U.S.
pension plans sponsored by the Corporation vary based on the
country and local practices.
The Qualified Pension Plan has a balance guarantee feature
for account balances with participant-selected investments,
applied at the time a benefit payment is made from the plan
that effectively provides principal protection for participant
balances transferred and certain compensation credits. The
Corporation is responsible for funding any shortfall on the
guarantee feature.
Benefits earned under the Qualified Pension Plan have been
frozen. Thereafter, the cash balance accounts continue to earn
investment credits or interest credits in accordance with the
terms of the plan document.
The Corporation has an annuity contract that guarantees the
payment of benefits vested under a terminated U.S. pension
plan (Other Pension Plan). The Corporation, under a
supplemental agreement, may be responsible for or benefit from
actual experience and investment performance of the annuity
assets. The Corporation made no contribution under this
agreement in 2021 or 2020. Contributions may be required in
the future under this agreement.
The Corporation9s noncontributory, nonqualified pension
plans are unfunded and provide supplemental defined pension
benefits to certain eligible employees.
In addition to retirement pension benefits, certain benefits-
eligible employees may become eligible to continue participation
as retirees in health care and/or life insurance plans sponsored
by the Corporation. These plans are referred to as the
Postretirement Health and Life Plans.
The Pension and Postretirement Plans table summarizes the
changes in the fair value of plan assets, changes in the
projected benefit obligation (PBO), the funded status of both the
accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) and the PBO, and the
weighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit
obligations for the pension plans and postretirement plans at
December 31, 2021 and 2020. The estimate of the
Corporation9s PBO associated with these plans considers
various actuarial assumptions, including assumptions for
mortality rates and discount rates. The discount rate
assumptions are derived from a cash flow matching technique
that utilizes rates that are based on Aa-rated corporate bonds
with cash flows that match estimated benefit payments of each
of the plans. The increases in the weighted-average discount
rates in 2021 resulted in a decrease to the PBO of
$895 million at December 31, 2021. The decreases in the
weighted-average discount rates in 2020 resulted in an increase
to the PBO of approximately $1.9 billion at December 31, 2020.
Significant gains and losses related to changes in the PBO for
2021 and 2020 primarily resulted from changes in the discount
rate.

The Corporation9s estimate of its contributions to be made
to the Non-U.S. Pension Plans, Nonqualified and Other Pension
Plans, and Postretirement Health and Life Plans in 2022 is $30
million, $91 million and $42 million, respectively. The
Corporation does not expect to make a contribution to the
Qualified Pension Plan in 2022. It is the policy of the
Corporation to fund no less than the minimum funding amount
required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974 (ERISA).
Pension Plans with ABO and PBO in excess of plan assets as
of December 31, 2021 and 2020 are presented in the table

The asset valuation method used to calculate the expected
return on plan assets component of net periodic benefit cost for
the Qualified Pension Plan recognizes 60 percent of the prior
year9s market gains or losses at the next measurement date
with the remaining 40 percent spread equally over the
subsequent four years.
Gains and losses for all benefit plans except postretirement
health care are recognized in accordance with the standard
amortization provisions of the applicable accounting guidance.
Net periodic postretirement health and life expense was
determined using the <projected unit credit= actuarial method.
For the Postretirement Health and Life Plans, 50 percent of the
unrecognized gain or loss at the beginning of the year (or at
subsequent remeasurement) is recognized on a level basis
during the year.
Assumed health care cost trend rates affect the
postretirement benefit obligation and benefit cost reported for
the Postretirement Health and Life Plans. The assumed health
care cost trend rate used to measure the expected cost of
benefits covered by the Postretirement Health and Life Plans is
6.25 percent for 2022, reducing in steps to 5.00 percent in
2027 and later years.
The Corporation9s net periodic benefit cost (income)
recognized for the plans is sensitive to the discount rate and
expected return on plan assets. For the Qualified Pension Plan,
Non-U.S. Pension Plans, Nonqualified and Other Pension Plans,
and Postretirement Health and Life Plans, a 25 bp decline in
discount rates and expected return on assets would not have
had a significant impact on the net periodic benefit cost for

Plan Assets
The Qualified Pension Plan has been established as a
retirement vehicle for participants, and trusts have been
established to secure benefits promised under the Qualified
Pension Plan. The Corporation9s policy is to invest the trust
assets in a prudent manner for the exclusive purpose of
providing benefits to participants and defraying reasonable
expenses of administration. The Corporation9s investment
strategy is designed to provide a total return that, over the long
term, increases the ratio of assets to liabilities. The strategy
attempts to maximize the investment return on assets at a level
of risk deemed appropriate by the Corporation while complying
with ERISA and any applicable regulations and laws. The
investment strategy utilizes asset allocation as a principal
determinant for establishing the risk/return profile of the
assets. Asset allocation ranges are established, periodically
reviewed and adjusted as funding levels and liability
characteristics change. Active and passive investment
managers are employed to help enhance the risk/return profile
of the assets. An additional aspect of the investment strategy
used to minimize risk (part of the asset allocation plan) includes
matching the exposure of participant-selected investment
measures.
The assets of the Non-U.S. Pension Plans are primarily
attributable to a U.K. pension plan. This U.K. pension plan9s
assets are invested prudently so that the benefits promised to
members are provided with consideration given to the nature
and the duration of the plans' liabilities. The selected asset

allocation strategy is designed to achieve a higher return than
the lowest risk strategy.
The expected rate of return on plan assets assumption was
developed through analysis of historical market returns,
historical asset class volatility and correlations, current market
conditions, anticipated future asset allocations, the funds9 past
experience and expectations on potential future market returns.
The expected return on plan assets assumption is determined
using the calculated market-related value for the Qualified
Pension Plan and the Other Pension Plan and the fair value for
the Non-U.S. Pension Plans and Postretirement Health and Life
Plans. The expected return on plan assets assumption
represents a long-term average view of the performance of the
assets in the Qualified Pension Plan, the Non-U.S. Pension
Plans, the Other Pension Plan, and Postretirement Health and
Life Plans, a return that may or may not be achieved during any
one calendar year. The Other Pension Plan is invested solely in
an annuity contract, which is primarily invested in fixed-income
securities structured such that asset maturities match the
duration of the plan9s obligations.
The target allocations for 2022 by asset category for the
Qualified Pension Plan, Non-U.S. Pension Plans, and
Nonqualified and Other Pension Plans are presented in the table
below. Equity securities for the Qualified Pension Plan include
common stock of the Corporation in the amounts of $398
million (1.80 percent of total plan assets) and $274 million
(1.26 percent of total plan assets) at December 31, 2021 and
2020.

Defined Contribution Plans
The Corporation maintains qualified and non-qualified defined
contribution retirement plans. The Corporation recorded expense
of $1.2 billion in both 2021 and 2020 and $1.0 billion in 2019
related to the qualified defined contribution plans. At December
31, 2021 and 2020, 173 million and 189 million shares of the
Corporation9s common stock were held by these plans.
Payments to the plans for dividends on common stock were
$139 million, $138 million and $133 million in 2021, 2020 and
2019, respectively.
Certain non-U.S. employees are covered under defined
contribution pension plans that are separately administered in
accordance with local laws.

NOTE 18 Stock-based Compensation Plans

The Corporation administers a number of equity compensation
plans, with awards being granted predominantly from the Bank
of America Key Employee Equity Plan (KEEP). On April 20, 2021,
Bank of America9s shareholders approved the amendment and
restatement of the KEEP, changing its name to the <Bank of
America Corporation Equity Plan= and increasing the number of
shares available for grant by 115 million. Subsequent to the
amendment and restatement, 715 million shares of the
Corporation9s common stock are authorized to be used for
grants of awards under this plan.
During 2021 and 2020, the Corporation granted 99 million
and 86 million RSU awards to certain employees under the
KEEP. These RSUs were authorized to settle predominantly in
shares of common stock of the Corporation. Certain RSUs will
be settled in cash or contain settlement provisions that subject
these awards to variable accounting whereby compensation
expense is adjusted to fair value based on changes in the share
price of the Corporation9s common stock up to the settlement
date. Of the RSUs granted in 2021 and 2020, 81 million and
29 million will generally vest over four years and 18 million and
57 million will vest over three years. The four-year awards vest
primarily in one-fourth increments on each of the first four
anniversaries of the grant date while the three-year awards vest
primarily in one-third increments on each of the first three
anniversaries of the grant date, provided that the employee
remains continuously employed with the Corporation during that
time, and will be expensed ratably over the vesting period, net
of estimated forfeitures, for non-retirement eligible employees
based on the grant-date fair value of the shares. Of the RSUs
granted in 2021 and 2020 that vest over four years, 27 million
and 25 million do not include retirement eligibility. For all other
RSUs granted to employees who are retirement eligible, they are
deemed authorized as of the beginning of the year preceding the
grant date when the incentive award plans are generally
approved. As a result, the estimated value is expensed ratably
over the year preceding the grant date. The compensation cost
for the stock-based plans was $3.0 billion, $2.1 billion and
$2.1 billion, and the related income tax benefit was $723
million, $505 million and $511 million for 2021, 2020 and
2019, respectively. At December 31, 2021, there was an
estimated $2.3 billion of total unrecognized compensation cost
related to certain share-based compensation awards that is
expected to be recognized over a period of up to four years, with
a weighted-average period of 2.4 years.

Total income tax expense does not reflect the tax effects of
items that are included in OCI each period. For more
information, see Note 14 3 Accumulated Other Comprehensive
Income (Loss). Other tax effects included in OCI each period
resulted in a benefit of $877 million in 2021 and expense of
$1.5 billion, and $1.9 billion in 2020 and 2019.
Income tax expense for 2021, 2020 and 2019 varied from
the amount computed by applying the statutory income tax rate
to income before income taxes. The Corporation9s federal
statutory tax rate was 21 percent for 2021, 2020 and 2019. A
reconciliation of the expected U.S. federal income tax expense,
calculated by applying the federal statutory tax rate, to the
Corporation9s actual income tax expense, and the effective tax
rates for 2021, 2020 and 2019 are presented in the following

million and $(613) million in the Reconciliation of Income Tax Expense table due to
temporary items, state items and jurisdictional offsets, as well as the inclusion of interest in
the Reconciliation of Income Tax Expense table.
At December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the balance of the
Corporation9s UTBs which would, if recognized, affect the
Corporation9s effective tax rate was $959 million, $976 million
and $814 million, respectively. Included in the UTB balance are
some items the recognition of which would not affect the
effective tax rate, such as the tax effect of certain temporary
differences, the portion of gross state UTBs that would be offset
by the tax benefit of the associated federal deduction and the
portion of gross non-U.S. UTBs that would be offset by tax
reductions in other jurisdictions.
It is reasonably possible that the UTB balance may decrease
by as much as $398 million during the next 12 months, since
resolved items will be removed from the balance whether their
resolution results in payment or recognition.
The Corporation recognized interest expense of $32 million
and $9 million in 2021 and 2020 and an interest benefit of $19
million in 2019. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the
Corporation9s accrual for interest and penalties that related to
income taxes, net of taxes and remittances, was $167 million
and $130 million.
The Corporation files income tax returns in more than 100
state and non-U.S. jurisdictions each year. The IRS and other
tax authorities in countries and states in which the Corporation
has significant business operations examine tax returns
periodically (continuously in some jurisdictions). The table below

(2) (^) The net operating losses and related valuation allowances for U.S. states before considering
the benefit of federal deductions were $1.5 billion and $772 million.
Management concluded that no valuation allowance was
necessary to reduce the deferred tax assets related to the U.K.
NOL carryforwards and U.S. federal and certain state NOL
carryforwards since estimated future taxable income will be
sufficient to utilize these assets prior to their expiration. The
majority of the Corporation9s U.K. net deferred tax assets, which
consist primarily of NOLs, are expected to be realized by certain
subsidiaries over an extended number of years. Management9s
conclusion is supported by financial results, profit forecasts for
the relevant entities and the indefinite period to carry forward
NOLs. However, a material change in those estimates could
lead management to reassess such valuation allowance
conclusions.
At December 31, 2021, U.S. federal income taxes had not
been provided on approximately $5.0 billion of temporary
differences associated with investments in non-U.S.
subsidiaries that are essentially permanent in duration. If the
Corporation were to record the associated deferred tax liability,
the amount would be approximately $1.0 billion.
NOTE 20 Fair Value Measurements
Under applicable accounting standards, fair value is defined as
the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid
to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most
advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants on the measurement
date. The Corporation determines the fair values of its financial
instruments under applicable accounting standards that require
an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize
the use of unobservable inputs. The Corporation categorizes its
financial instruments into three levels based on the established
fair value hierarchy and conducts a review of fair value hierarchy
classifications on a quarterly basis. Transfers into or out of fair
value hierarchy classifications are made if the significant inputs
used in the financial models measuring the fair values of the
assets and liabilities become unobservable or observable in the
current marketplace. For more information regarding the fair
value hierarchy and how the Corporation measures fair value,
see Note 1 3 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles. The
Corporation accounts for certain financial instruments under the
fair value option. For more information, see Note 21 3 Fair Value
Option.
Valuation Techniques
The following sections outline the valuation methodologies for
the Corporation9s assets and liabilities. While the Corporation
believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent
with other market participants, the use of different
methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of
certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate
of fair value at the reporting date.
During 2021, there were no significant changes to valuation
approaches or techniques that had, or are expected to have, a
material impact on the Corporation9s consolidated financial
position or results of operations.
Trading Account Assets and Liabilities and Debt Securities
The fair values of trading account assets and liabilities are
primarily based on actively traded markets where prices are
based on either direct market quotes or observed transactions.
The fair values of debt securities are generally based on quoted
market prices or market prices for similar assets. Liquidity is a
significant factor in the determination of the fair values of
trading account assets and liabilities and debt securities.
Market price quotes may not be readily available for some
positions such as positions within a market sector where
trading activity has slowed significantly or ceased. Some of
these instruments are valued using a discounted cash flow
model, which estimates the fair value of the securities using
internal credit risk, and interest rate and prepayment risk
models that incorporate management9s best estimate of current
key assumptions such as default rates, loss severity and
prepayment rates. Principal and interest cash flows are
discounted using an observable discount rate for similar
instruments with adjustments that management believes a
market participant would consider in determining fair value for
the specific security. Other instruments are valued using a net
asset value approach which considers the value of the
underlying securities. Underlying assets are valued using
external pricing services, where available, or matrix pricing
based on the vintages and ratings. Situations of illiquidity
generally are triggered by the market9s perception of credit
uncertainty regarding a single company or a specific market
sector. In these instances, fair value is determined based on
limited available market information and other factors,
principally from reviewing the issuer9s financial statements and
changes in credit ratings made by one or more rating agencies.
Derivative Assets and Liabilities
The fair values of derivative assets and liabilities traded in the
OTC market are determined using quantitative models that
utilize multiple market inputs including interest rates, prices and
indices to generate continuous yield or pricing curves and
volatility factors to value the position. The majority of market
inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external
sources, including brokers, market transactions and third-party
pricing services. When third-party pricing services are used, the
methods and assumptions are reviewed by the Corporation.
Estimation risk is greater for derivative asset and liability
positions that are either option-based or have longer maturity
Bank of America 2021 189

dates where observable market inputs are less readily available,
or are unobservable, in which case, quantitative-based
extrapolations of rate, price or index scenarios are used in
determining fair values. The fair values of derivative assets and
liabilities include adjustments for market liquidity, counterparty
credit quality and other instrument-specific factors, where
appropriate. In addition, the Corporation incorporates within its
fair value measurements of OTC derivatives a valuation
adjustment to reflect the credit risk associated with the net
position. Positions are netted by counterparty, and fair value for
net long exposures is adjusted for counterparty credit risk while
the fair value for net short exposures is adjusted for the
Corporation9s own credit risk. The Corporation also incorporates
FVA within its fair value measurements to include funding costs
on uncollateralized derivatives and derivatives where the
Corporation is not permitted to use the collateral it receives. An
estimate of severity of loss is also used in the determination of
fair value, primarily based on market data.

Loans and Loan Commitments
The fair values of loans and loan commitments are based on
market prices, where available, or discounted cash flow
analyses using market-based credit spreads of comparable debt
instruments or credit derivatives of the specific borrower or
comparable borrowers. Results of discounted cash flow
analyses may be adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect other
market conditions or the perceived credit risk of the borrower.

Mortgage Servicing Rights
The fair values of MSRs are primarily determined using an
option-adjusted spread valuation approach, which factors in
prepayment risk to determine the fair value of MSRs. This
approach consists of projecting servicing cash flows under
multiple interest rate scenarios and discounting these cash
flows using risk-adjusted discount rates.

Loans Held-for-sale
The fair values of LHFS are based on quoted market prices,
where available, or are determined by discounting estimated
cash flows using interest rates approximating the Corporation9s
current origination rates for similar loans adjusted to reflect the
inherent credit risk. The borrower-specific credit risk is
embedded within the quoted market prices or is implied by
considering loan performance when selecting comparables.

Short-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt
The Corporation issues structured liabilities that have coupons
or repayment terms linked to the performance of debt or equity
securities, interest rates, indices, currencies or commodities.
The fair values of these structured liabilities are estimated using
quantitative models for the combined derivative and debt
portions of the notes. These models incorporate observable
and, in some instances, unobservable inputs including security
prices, interest rate yield curves, option volatility, currency,
commodity or equity rates and correlations among these inputs.
The Corporation also considers the impact of its own credit
spread in determining the discount rate used to value these
liabilities. The credit spread is determined by reference to
observable spreads in the secondary bond market.
Securities Financing Agreements
The fair values of certain reverse repurchase agreements,
repurchase agreements and securities borrowed transactions
are determined using quantitative models, including discounted
cash flow models that require the use of multiple market inputs
including interest rates and spreads to generate continuous
yield or pricing curves, and volatility factors. The majority of
market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through
external sources, including brokers, market transactions and
third-party pricing services.
Deposits
The fair values of deposits are determined using quantitative
models, including discounted cash flow models that require the
use of multiple market inputs including interest rates and
spreads to generate continuous yield or pricing curves, and
volatility factors. The majority of market inputs are actively
quoted and can be validated through external sources, including
brokers, market transactions and third-party pricing services.
The Corporation considers the impact of its own credit spread in
the valuation of these liabilities. The credit risk is determined by
reference to observable credit spreads in the secondary cash
market.
Asset-backed Secured Financings
The fair values of asset-backed secured financings are based on
external broker bids, where available, or are determined by
discounting estimated cash flows using interest rates
approximating the Corporation9s current origination rates for
similar loans adjusted to reflect the inherent credit risk.

The following tables present a reconciliation of all assets transfers out of Level 3 occur primarily due to increased price
and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using observability. Transfers occur on a regular basis for long-term
significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) during 2021, 2020 and debt instruments due to changes in the impact of unobservable
2019, including net realized and unrealized gains (losses) inputs on the value of the embedded derivative in relation to the
included in earnings and accumulated OCI. Transfers into Level instrument as a whole.

In the previous tables, instruments backed by residential
and commercial real estate assets include RMBS, commercial
MBS, whole loans and mortgage CDOs. Commercial loans, debt
securities and other include corporate CLOs and CDOs,
commercial loans and bonds, and securities backed by non-real
estate assets. Structured liabilities primarily include equity-
linked notes that are accounted for under the fair value option.
The Corporation uses multiple market approaches in valuing
certain of its Level 3 financial instruments. For example, market
comparables and discounted cash flows are used together. For
a given product, such as corporate debt securities, market
comparables may be used to estimate some of the
unobservable inputs and then these inputs are incorporated into
a discounted cash flow model. Therefore, the balances
disclosed encompass both of these techniques.
The levels of aggregation and diversity within the products
disclosed in the tables result in certain ranges of inputs being
wide and unevenly distributed across asset and liability
categories.

Uncertainty of Fair Value Measurements from

Unobservable Inputs

Loans and Securities
A significant increase in market yields, default rates, loss
severities or duration would have resulted in a significantly lower
fair value for long positions. Short positions would have been
impacted in a directionally opposite way. The impact of changes
in prepayment speeds would have resulted in differing impacts
depending on the seniority of the instrument and, in the case of
CLOs, whether prepayments can be reinvested. A significant
increase in price would have resulted in a significantly higher
fair value for long positions, and short positions would have
been impacted in a directionally opposite way.

Structured Liabilities and Derivatives
For credit derivatives, a significant increase in market yield,

upfront points (i.e., a single upfront payment made by a
protection buyer at inception), credit spreads, default rates or
loss severities would have resulted in a significantly lower fair
value for protection sellers and higher fair value for protection
buyers. The impact of changes in prepayment speeds would
have resulted in differing impacts depending on the seniority of
the instrument.
Structured credit derivatives are impacted by credit
correlation. Default correlation is a parameter that describes the
degree of dependence among credit default rates within a credit
portfolio that underlies a credit derivative instrument. The
sensitivity of this input on the fair value varies depending on the
level of subordination of the tranche. For senior tranches that
are net purchases of protection, a significant increase in default
correlation would have resulted in a significantly higher fair
value. Net short protection positions would have been impacted
in a directionally opposite way.
For equity derivatives, commodity derivatives, interest rate
derivatives and structured liabilities, a significant change in
long-dated rates and volatilities and correlation inputs (i.e., the
degree of correlation between an equity security and an index,
between two different commodities, between two different
interest rates, or between interest rates and foreign exchange
rates) would have resulted in a significant impact to the fair
value; however, the magnitude and direction of the impact
depend on whether the Corporation is long or short the
exposure. For structured liabilities, a significant increase in yield
or decrease in price would have resulted in a significantly lower
fair value.
Nonrecurring Fair Value
The Corporation holds certain assets that are measured at fair
value only in certain situations (e.g., the impairment of an
asset), and these measurements are referred to herein as
nonrecurring. The amounts below represent assets still held as
of the reporting date for which a nonrecurring fair value
adjustment was recorded during 2021, 2020 and 2019.

NOTE 21 Fair Value Option
Loans and Loan Commitments
The Corporation elects to account for certain loans and loan
commitments that exceed the Corporation9s single-name credit
risk concentration guidelines under the fair value option.
Lending commitments are actively managed and, as
appropriate, credit risk for these lending relationships may be
mitigated through the use of credit derivatives, with the
Corporation9s public side credit view and market perspectives
determining the size and timing of the hedging activity. These
credit derivatives do not meet the requirements for designation
as accounting hedges and are carried at fair value. The fair
value option allows the Corporation to carry these loans and
loan commitments at fair value, which is more consistent with
management9s view of the underlying economics and the
manner in which they are managed. In addition, the fair value
option allows the Corporation to reduce the accounting volatility
that would otherwise result from the asymmetry created by
accounting for the financial instruments at historical cost and
the credit derivatives at fair value.
Loans Held-for-sale
The Corporation elects to account for residential mortgage
LHFS, commercial mortgage LHFS and certain other LHFS under
the fair value option. These loans are actively managed and
monitored and, as appropriate, certain market risks of the loans
may be mitigated through the use of derivatives. The
Corporation has elected not to designate the derivatives as
qualifying accounting hedges, and therefore, they are carried at
fair value. The changes in fair value of the loans are largely
offset by changes in the fair value of the derivatives. The fair
value option allows the Corporation to reduce the accounting
volatility that would otherwise result from the asymmetry created
by accounting for the financial instruments at the lower of cost
or fair value and the derivatives at fair value. The Corporation
has not elected to account for certain other LHFS under the fair
value option primarily because these loans are floating-rate
loans that are not hedged using derivative instruments.
Loans Reported as Trading Account Assets
The Corporation elects to account for certain loans that are held
for the purpose of trading and are risk-managed on a fair value
basis under the fair value option.
Other Assets
The Corporation elects to account for certain long-term fixed-rate
margin loans that are hedged with derivatives under the fair
value option. Election of the fair value option allows the
Corporation to reduce the accounting volatility that would
otherwise result from the asymmetry created by accounting for
the financial instruments at historical cost and the derivatives at
fair value.
Securities Financing Agreements
The Corporation elects to account for certain securities
financing agreements, including resale and repurchase
agreements, under the fair value option. These elections include
certain agreements collateralized by the U.S. government and
its agencies, which are generally short-dated and have minimal
interest rate risk.
Long-term Deposits
The Corporation elects to account for certain long-term fixed-rate
and rate-linked deposits that are hedged with derivatives that do
not qualify for hedge accounting. Election of the fair value option
allows the Corporation to reduce the accounting volatility that
would otherwise result from the asymmetry created by
accounting for the financial instruments at historical cost and
the derivatives at fair value. The Corporation has not elected to
carry other long-term deposits at fair value because they are not
hedged using derivatives.
Short-term Borrowings
The Corporation elects to account for certain short-term
borrowings, primarily short-term structured liabilities, under the
fair value option because this debt is risk-managed on a fair
value basis.
198 Bank of America 2021

The Corporation also elects to account for certain asset-
backed secured financings, which are also classified in short-
term borrowings, under the fair value option. Election of the fair
value option allows the Corporation to reduce the accounting
volatility that would otherwise result from the asymmetry created
by accounting for the asset-backed secured financings at
historical cost and the corresponding mortgage LHFS securing
these financings at fair value.

Long-term Debt
The Corporation elects to account for certain long-term debt,
primarily structured liabilities, under the fair value option. This

long-term debt is either risk-managed on a fair value basis or
the related hedges do not qualify for hedge accounting.
Fair Value Option Elections
The following tables provide information about the fair value
carrying amount and the contractual principal outstanding of
assets and liabilities accounted for under the fair value option
at December 31, 2021 and 2020, and information about where
changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities accounted for
under the fair value option are included in the Consolidated
Statement of Income for 2021, 2020 and 2019.

NOTE 22 Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Financial instruments are classified within the fair value
hierarchy using the methodologies described in Note 20 3 Fair
Value Measurements. Certain loans, deposits, long-term debt,
unfunded lending commitments and other financial instruments
are accounted for under the fair value option. For more
information, see Note 21 3 Fair Value Option. The following
disclosures include financial instruments that are not carried at
fair value or only a portion of the ending balance is carried at
fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Short-term Financial Instruments
The carrying value of short-term financial instruments, including
cash and cash equivalents, certain time deposits placed and
other short-term investments, federal funds sold and purchased,
certain resale and repurchase agreements and short-term
borrowings, approximates the fair value of these instruments.
These financial instruments generally expose the Corporation to
limited credit risk and have no stated maturities or have short-
term maturities and carry interest rates that approximate
market. The Corporation accounts for certain resale and
repurchase agreements under the fair value option.
Under the fair value hierarchy, cash and cash equivalents
are classified as Level 1. Time deposits placed and other short-
term investments, such as U.S. government securities and
short-term commercial paper, are classified as Level 1 or Level

Federal funds sold and purchased are classified as Level 2.
Resale and repurchase agreements are classified as Level 2
because they are generally short-dated and/or variable-rate
instruments collateralized by U.S. government or agency
securities. Short-term borrowings are classified as Level 2.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The carrying values and fair values by fair value hierarchy of
certain financial instruments where only a portion of the ending
balance was carried at fair value at December 31, 2021 and

The carrying value of commercial unfunded lending commitments is included in accrued
expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Corporation does not
estimate the fair value of consumer unfunded lending commitments because, in many
instances, the Corporation can reduce or cancel these commitments by providing notice to
the borrower. For more information on commitments, see Note 12 3 Commitments and
Contingencies.
NOTE 23 Business Segment Information
The Corporation reports its results of operations through the
following four business segments: Consumer Banking, GWIM
Global Banking and Global Markets, with the remaining
operations recorded in All Other.
Consumer Banking
Consumer Banking offers a diversified range of credit, banking
and investment products and services to consumers and small
businesses. Consumer Banking product offerings include
traditional savings accounts, money market savings accounts,
CDs and IRAs, checking accounts, and investment accounts and
products, as well as credit and debit cards, residential
mortgages and home equity loans, and direct and indirect loans
to consumers and small businesses in the U.S. Consumer
Banking includes the impact of servicing residential mortgages
and home equity loans.
Global Wealth & Investment Management
GWIM provides a high-touch client experience through a network
of financial advisors focused on clients with over $250,000 in
total investable assets, including tailored solutions to meet
clients9 needs through a full set of investment management,
brokerage, banking and retirement products. GWIM also
provides comprehensive wealth management solutions targeted
to high net worth and ultra high net worth clients, as well as
customized solutions to meet clients9 wealth structuring,
investment management, trust and banking needs, including
specialty asset management services.
Global Banking
Global Banking provides a wide range of lending-related products
and services, integrated working capital management and
treasury solutions, and underwriting and advisory services
through the Corporation9s network of offices and client
relationship teams. Global Banking also provides investment
banking products to clients. The economics of certain
investment banking and underwriting activities are shared
primarily between Global Banking and Global Markets under an
internal revenue-sharing arrangement. Global Banking clients
generally include middle-market companies, commercial real
estate firms, not-for-profit companies, large global corporations,
financial institutions, leasing clients, and mid-sized U.S.-based
businesses requiring customized and integrated financial advice
and solutions.
Global Markets
Global Markets offers sales and trading services and research
services to institutional clients across fixed-income, credit,
currency, commodity and equity businesses. Global Markets
provides market-making, financing, securities clearing,
settlement and custody services globally to institutional investor
clients in support of their investing and trading activities. Global
Markets product coverage includes securities and derivative
products in both the primary and secondary markets. Global
Markets also works with commercial and corporate clients to
provide risk management products. As a result of market-
making activities, Global Markets may be required to manage
risk in a broad range of financial products. In addition, the
economics of certain investment banking and underwriting
activities are shared primarily between Global Markets and
Global Banking under an internal revenue-sharing arrangement.
All Other
All Other primarily consists of ALM activities, liquidating
businesses and certain expenses not otherwise allocated to a
business segment. ALM activities encompass interest rate and
foreign currency risk management activities for which
substantially all of the results are allocated to the business
segments.
Basis of Presentation
The management accounting and reporting process derives
segment and business results by utilizing allocation
methodologies for revenue and expense. The net income
derived for the businesses is dependent upon revenue and cost
allocations using an activity-based costing model, funds transfer
pricing, and other methodologies and assumptions management
believes are appropriate to reflect the results of the business.
Total revenue, net of interest expense, includes net interest
income on an FTE basis and noninterest income. The
adjustment of net interest income to an FTE basis results in a
corresponding increase in income tax expense. The segment
results also reflect certain revenue and expense methodologies
that are utilized to determine net income. The net interest
income of the businesses includes the results of a funds
transfer pricing process that matches assets and liabilities with
similar interest rate sensitivity and maturity characteristics. In
segments where the total of liabilities and equity exceeds
assets, which are generally deposit-taking segments, the
Corporation allocates assets to match liabilities. Net interest
income of the business segments also includes an allocation of
net interest income generated by certain of the Corporation9s
ALM activities.
The Corporation9s ALM activities include an overall interest
rate risk management strategy that incorporates the use of
various derivatives and cash instruments to manage
fluctuations in earnings and capital that are caused by interest
rate volatility. The Corporation9s goal is to manage interest rate
sensitivity so that movements in interest rates do not
significantly adversely affect earnings and capital. The results of
Bank of America 2021 201

substantially all of the Corporation9s ALM activities are allocated
to the business segments and fluctuate based on the
performance of the ALM activities. ALM activities include
external product pricing decisions including deposit pricing
strategies, the effects of the Corporation9s internal funds
transfer pricing process and the net effects of other ALM
activities.
Certain expenses not directly attributable to a specific
business segment are allocated to the segments. The costs of
certain centralized or shared functions are allocated based on
methodologies that reflect utilization.
Effective October 1, 2021, a business activity previously
included in the Global Markets segment is being reported as a
liquidating business in All Other, consistent with a realignment

in performance reporting to senior management. While this
activity was not material to Global Markets9 results of operations
and historical results have not been restated, this activity9s
noninterest expense of $309 million and $473 million for the
three months ended September 30, 2021 and June 30, 2021
was elevated and would have been excluded from Global
Markets9 results of operations for those periods under the new
basis of presentation.
The table below presents net income (loss) and the
components thereto (with net interest income on an FTE basis
for the business segments, All Other and the total Corporation)
for 2021, 2020 and 2019, and total assets at December 31,
2021 and 2020 for each business segment, as well as All
Other.

NOTE 25 Performance by Geographical Area
The Corporation9s operations are highly integrated with
operations in both U.S. and non-U.S. markets. The non-U.S.
business activities are largely conducted in Europe, the Middle
East and Africa and in Asia. The Corporation identifies its
geographic performance based on the business unit structure
used to manage the capital or expense deployed in the region
as applicable. This requires certain judgments related to the
allocation of revenue so that revenue can be appropriately
matched with the related capital or expense deployed in the
region. Certain asset, liability, income and expense amounts
have been allocated to arrive at total assets, total revenue, net
of interest expense, income before income taxes and net
income by geographic area as presented below.

Glossary

Alt-A Mortgage 3 A type of U.S. mortgage that is considered
riskier than A-paper, or <prime,= and less risky than <subprime,=
the riskiest category. Typically, Alt-A mortgages are
characterized by borrowers with less than full documentation,
lower credit scores and higher LTVs.

Assets Under Management (AUM) 3 The total market value of
assets under the investment advisory and/or discretion of GWIM
which generate asset management fees based on a percentage
of the assets9 market values. AUM reflects assets that are
generally managed for institutional, high net worth and retail
clients, and are distributed through various investment products
including mutual funds, other commingled vehicles and separate
accounts.

Banking Book 3 All on- and off-balance sheet financial
instruments of the Corporation except for those positions that
are held for trading purposes.

Brokerage and Other Assets 3 Non-discretionary client assets
which are held in brokerage accounts or held for safekeeping.

Committed Credit Exposure 3 Any funded portion of a facility plus
the unfunded portion of a facility on which the lender is legally
bound to advance funds during a specified period under
prescribed conditions.

Credit Derivatives 3 Contractual agreements that provide
protection against a specified credit event on one or more
referenced obligations.

Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) 3 A portfolio adjustment
required to properly reflect the counterparty credit risk exposure
as part of the fair value of derivative instruments.

Debit Valuation Adjustment (DVA) 3 A portfolio adjustment
required to properly reflect the Corporation9s own credit risk
exposure as part of the fair value of derivative instruments and/
or structured liabilities.

Funding Valuation Adjustment (FVA) 3 A portfolio adjustment
required to include funding costs on uncollateralized derivatives
and derivatives where the Corporation is not permitted to use
the collateral it receives.

Interest Rate Lock Commitment (IRLC) 3 Commitment with a
loan applicant in which the loan terms are guaranteed for a
designated period of time subject to credit approval.

Letter of Credit 3 A document issued on behalf of a customer to
a third party promising to pay the third party upon presentation
of specified documents. A letter of credit effectively substitutes
the issuer9s credit for that of the customer.

Loan-to-value (LTV) 3 A commonly used credit quality metric. LTV
is calculated as the outstanding carrying value of the loan
divided by the estimated value of the property securing the loan.
Margin Receivable 3 An extension of credit secured by eligible
securities in certain brokerage accounts.
Matched Book 3 Repurchase and resale agreements or
securities borrowed and loaned transactions where the overall
asset and liability position is similar in size and/or maturity.
Generally, these are entered into to accommodate customers
where the Corporation earns the interest rate spread.
Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSR) 3 The right to service a
mortgage loan when the underlying loan is sold or securitized.
Servicing includes collections for principal, interest and escrow
payments from borrowers and accounting for and remitting
principal and interest payments to investors.
Nonperforming Loans and Leases 3 Includes loans and leases
that have been placed on nonaccrual status, including
nonaccruing loans whose contractual terms have been
restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower
experiencing financial difficulties.
Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) 3 A framework established by the
U.S. banking regulators requiring banks to maintain certain
levels of regulatory capital ratios, comprised of five categories
of capitalization: <well capitalized,= <adequately capitalized,=
<undercapitalized,= <significantly undercapitalized= and
<critically undercapitalized.= Insured depository institutions that
fail to meet certain of these capital levels are subject to
increasingly strict limits on their activities, including their ability
to make capital distributions, pay management compensation,
grow assets and take other actions.
Subprime Loans 3 Although a standard industry definition for
subprime loans (including subprime mortgage loans) does not
exist, the Corporation defines subprime loans as specific
product offerings for higher risk borrowers.
Troubled Debt Restructurings (TDRs) 3 Loans whose contractual
terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a
concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties.
Certain consumer loans for which a binding offer to restructure
has been extended are also classified as TDRs.
Value-at-Risk (VaR) 3 VaR is a model that simulates the value of
a portfolio under a range of hypothetical scenarios in order to
generate a distribution of potential gains and losses. VaR
represents the loss the portfolio is expected to experience with
a given confidence level based on historical data. A VaR model
is an effective tool in estimating ranges of potential gains and
losses on our trading portfolios.

BANK OF AMERICA CORPORATION | 2021 ANNUAL REPORT

Barclays started reporting against the SASB standards in 2019 as we recognise the importance among our investor base.

SASB is a global framework with, at present, a US-focused approach to defining criteria, and so we have aimed to include cross-

references to the most relevant parts of our UK-based reporting to the SASB indicators, having regard to the purpose behind the

SASB indicators.

The table below maps where in our public documents relevant information for SASB standards and indicators can be found. The

standards have been selected based on their relevance to the Barclays Group9s business.

This report reflects the information and data available for the Barclays Group for the year ended 31 December 2022. We continue to

work on enhancing the scope of our reporting against the SASB framework, with the understanding that these will form a part of the

ISSB9s global standards in the future.

BlackRock9s 2021 Sustainability Disclosure 2

Important Notes: This Disclosure contains information about BlackRock and may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, may be forward-looking statements, including statements related to BlackRock9s
climate and other sustainability-related strategies, plans, developments, targets, goals, and expectations.
BlackRock cautions that forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties, which change ov er time. Forward-looking
statements speak only as of the date they are made, and BlackRock assumes no duty to and does not undertake to update forward-looking statements. Actual results
could differ materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements and future results could differ materially from historical performance. The companies
mentioned in this document should not be considered a recommendation to buy or sell any security.
Factors that can cause results to differ, as well as additional factors that can affect forward-looking statements, are discussed in BlackRock9s Annual Report on Form
10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, accessible on the SEC9s website at http://www.sec.gov and on BlackRock9s website at http://www.blackrock.com.
The information provided herein is based in part on information from third-party sources that BlackRock believes to be reliable, but which has not been independently
verified by BlackRock, and BlackRock does not represent that the information is accurate or complete. The inclusion of information contained in this report should not
be construed as a characterization regarding the materiality or financial impact of that information.
This Disclosure includes metrics that are subject to measurement uncertainties resulting from limitations inherent in the nature and the methods used for
determining such data. The selection of different but acceptable measurement techniques can result in materially different measurements. The precision of different
measurement techniques may also vary. Unless specified otherwise, the information set forth herein is expressed as of December 2021 and BlackRock reserves the
right to update its measurement techniques and methodologies in the future.
Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (<SASB=)

SASB is an independent non-profit organization that sets

standards to guide the disclosure of sustainability

information by companies to their investors. The SASB

reporting standards are sector specific, covering

environmental, social, and governance (<ESG=) reporting

criteria for 77 different industries. Each SASB Standard

defines a minimum set of ESG-related topics that are

reasonably likely to affect a company9s long-term

performance based on the industry it operates within. For

BlackRock, the most relevant industry group is Asset

Management & Custody Activities. In 2021, SASB and the

Integrated Reporting Framework formalized their merger to

become the Value Reporting Foundation. Moving forward,

the International Financial Reporting Standards (<IFRS=)

Foundation, through the newly formed International

Sustainability Standards Board (<ISSB=) will consolidate the

Climate Disclosure Standards Board and the Value

Reporting Foundation in 2022. As such, while BlackRock9s

reporting in this document is performed in accordance with

the SASB Standard version 2021-12. BlackRock supports

the ISSB9s efforts to develop a global baseline of

sustainability reporting standards, on which different

jurisdictions can build, to enable reliable and comparable

corporate reporting about enterprise value. BlackRock will

monitor the evolution of the global standards and may

evolve its reporting to these new standards as they emerge.

About this disclosure

Management Criteria and Stakeholder Assessment
In 2020, BlackRock conducted an assessment to hone its
understanding of the ESG topics that matter most to its
stakeholders. The assessment drew on research conducted
and compiled in 2020 from a variety of sources including
feedback from business groups, BlackRock9s Employee
Opinion Survey, shareholder engagement, external reports,
and articles, ESG ratings questionnaires, and peer
benchmarking. BlackRock defines its stakeholders to
include clients, shareholders, employees, shareholders, and
the communities in which BlackRock operates. BlackRock
believes this assessment is still accurate and representative
of what is most material to its stakeholders. While many of
the topics most important to BlackRock9s stakeholders were
covered by third-party standards and recommendations –
including SASB and the Task Force on Climate-related
Financial Disclosures (<TCFD=) –against which BlackRock
was already reporting, several topics were not fully covered
by either reporting standard. As a result, BlackRock has
elected to supplement its SASB disclosures with additional
metrics defined by Management (<Management Criteria=).
Management criteria were informed by a number of
frameworks including SASB Standards for sectors outside
of the Asset Management and Custody Activities Standard
and the United Nations Global Compact Communication on
Progress (<CoP=) advanced reporting requirements. A
detailed index of the criteria used to prepare this report is
included in the Notes section beginning on page 35.
BlackRock9s 2021 Sustainability Disclosure

BlackRock9s 2021 Sustainability Disclosure (<Disclosure=) is being provided for BlackRock, Inc. (together, with its
subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise indicates, <BlackRock= or the <Company= or the <firm=). This Disclosure is
comprised of two types of metrics:^1
1) Reporting presented in accordance with the SASB Standard for Asset Management and Custody Activities; and
2)Reporting in accordance with select additional criteria defined by management (<Management Criteria=).
UN Global Compact Communication on Progress
In 2020, BlackRock became a participant of the United
Nations Global Compact (<UNGC=). As a participant of the
UNGC, BlackRock is committed to supporting the Ten
Principles of the UNGC, and the United Nations
Sustainable Development Goals (<SDGs=). In 2021,
BlackRock submitted its first Communication on Progress
to describe its efforts to align its operations with universal
principles on human rights, labor, environment, and anti-
corruption, and its actions to advance societal goals, and
achieved Global Compact Advanced level reporting. This
year, as a part of its participation in the UNGC, BlackRock is
submitting this Disclosure as its 2022 Communication on
Progress.^3
Management9s Assertion
Management of BlackRock, Inc. is responsible for the
completeness, accuracy, and validity of the disclosures
included in this Disclosure as of, and for the year-ended
December 31, 2021. Management is also responsible for
the collection, quantification, and presentation of the
information included in the Disclosure and for the selection
or development of the criteria, which management believes
provide an objective basis for measuring and reporting on
the selected metrics.
Management of BlackRock, Inc. asserts that the specified
metrics included in the Disclosure as of, and for the year
ended December 31, 2021 are presented in accordance
with the criteria set forth in Note 1: Basis of Presentation to

related to specified metrics (included in the Description of
Management Criteria in the Notes section on page 37) in

Sustainability disclosure is available on page 39.

Dedicated Sustainable Investments^4

BlackRock currently defines Dedicated Sustainable

Investments as: (i) strategies with an explicit ESG objective

which may include a targeted quantifiable ESG outcome

(<Broad ESG=); (ii) strategies that capitalize on long-term

transformative industry or societal trends through pursuit of

specific E, S, or G themes (<Thematic=); (iii) strategies where

investments are made with the intention to generate positive

measurable social and environmental impact alongside

financial return (<Impact=) and; (iv) strategies that incorporate

a package of sustainability screens (<Dedicated Screened=).

BlackRock has designed an extensive platform encompassing

index, active, and alternative strategies across asset classes

to help clients meet their financial objectives and

sustainability goals.

BlackRock offers over 300 sustainable funds covering the

spectrum of sustainable solutions, as well as customized

solutions to meet clients9 objectives. As of December 31,

2021, BlackRock managed $509 billion across its Dedicated

Sustainable Investing platform which is inclusive of funds

and separate accounts. Dedicated Sustainable Investment

strategies are categorized into the following product types:

Dedicated Screened^5 , Broad ESG, Thematic, and Impact.^6

ESG Integrated Portfolios

BlackRock draws a clear distinction between Dedicated
Sustainable Investments and ESG-integrated portfolios.^7
BlackRock9s investment conviction is that ESG-integrated
portfolios may provide better long-term risk-adjusted
returns to investors and clients. As such, BlackRock9s active
investment platform has been ESG integrated, representing
$3.37 trillion of BlackRock9s assets under management
(<AUM=). ESG-integrated portfolios are not considered a
separate product category at BlackRock and do not
necessarily have an ESG objective as part of their
mandates. Therefore, ESG-integrated portfolios are not
included in the Dedicated Sustainable Investments figures
reported below. Additional information about ESG
integration is provided under SASB FN-AC-410a.2.
Quantitative Metrics

Exhibit 1 provides the AUM in Dedicated Sustainable
Investments and Screened Investments strategies.
Screened Investments are products that BlackRock
considers to sit alongside, but not within, its Dedicated
Sustainable Investments, as they do not apply the
comprehensive criteria of what BlackRock has developed
for its Dedicated Screened funds. Dedicated Screens are
included under Dedicated Sustainable Investments.
BlackRock9s clients may request portfolios that avoid
exposure to certain companies or sectors that do not align
with their views.

ESG Integration

BlackRock defines ESG integration as the practice of
incorporating ESG information into the investment process
with the objective of improving long-term financial
outcomes of BlackRock9s clients9 portfolios. BlackRock does
this in its active portfolios in both public and private
markets. In index portfolios where the objective is to
replicate a predetermined market benchmark, BlackRock
engages with investee companies on ESG issues to
enhance long-term value for its clients.
BlackRock9s firm-level ESG Integration Statement details
its firmwide efforts to integrate ESG information into
investment processes. The ESG Integration Statement
outlines the mechanisms that underpin BlackRock9s
approach. This ESG Integration Statement applies across
BlackRock9s investment divisions and investment teams
and is reviewed at least annually to reflect changes within
BlackRock9s business. Given the breadth of the firm9s
investment platform, this ESG Integration Statement is
written to cover the full spectrum of investment styles and
asset classes at BlackRock.
In addition, each investment platform has produced a
platform-level ESG Integration Statement that describes
different implementations of the firm-wide approach.
BlackRock9s consistent yet flexible framework allows for
cohesion with the firm9s overall ESG integration efforts,
while permitting a diversity of approaches across different
investment teams. ESG considerations will vary by client
objectives, investment style, sector, and market trends.
Oversight & Accountability
At the portfolio level, BlackRock portfolio managers are
accountable for appropriately managing exposure to ESG
risks. Investment teams can develop views on the financial
materiality of specific sustainability-related topics by
considering external and proprietary ESG research from a
variety of sources.
Investment platform leadership within BlackRock9s
investment divisions oversees and is accountable for ESG
integration into the investment processes for each
business. This includes determining appropriate
methodologies for each underlying investment team and
facilitating ESG integration into the investment processes

Description of approach to incorporate ESG factors in investment and/or wealth management
processes and strategies
and portfolio objectives for each respective business. Many
investment teams have specialized sustainability -focused
experts and/or units to help drive ESG integration and
sustainable investment product development within the
business.
In addition, BlackRock employs dedicated resources to
support sustainable investing. The BlackRock Sustainable
Investing team(<BSI=) and individuals across the
technology and analytics platform work together to
advance ESG research and tools that support ESG
integration. BSI encourages consistency in consideration of
ESG factors across investment processes, aggregates
resources and shares best practices.
BlackRock9s Risk and Quantitative Analysis Group (<RQA=)
is responsible for BlackRock9s Enterprise Risk and
Investment risk management framework which includes
oversight of ESG-related investment risks. RQA conducts
regular reviews with portfolio managers to ensure that
investment decisions are taken in light of relevant
investment risks, including sustainability -related risks, and
that decisions exposing portfolios to ESG risks are
deliberate and consistent with the investment objectives of
BlackRock9s clients9 portfolios.
Furthermore, in January 2022, RQA formed a dedicated
Sustainability Risk group to support the ongoing
application of ESG considerations across investment and
enterprise activities. The team will partner with risk
managers and businesses to reinforce constructive
engagement across BlackRock9s investment platform,
through dedicated ESG research and enhanced second line
sustainability risk oversight processes.
BSI and RQA jointly report on ESG integration progress to
the Global Executive Committee Investment Sub -
Committee at least annually.
As described under FN-AC-410a.3, the BlackRock
Investment Stewardship team (<BIS=) engages with
companies to promote corporate governance standards
that the team believes contribute to companies9 abilities to
deliver the durable long-term profitability our clients
depend on to meet their long-term financial goals.
Sustainable Investing Research
BSI maintains a dedicated sustainable investing research
function, producing insights that inform firm investment
processes. In addition, BlackRock9s investment teams often
have dedicated sustainability -focused experts and research
teams. BSI develops proprietary views on specific
sustainability-related topics by leveraging external data, as
well as proprietary research, and delivers these insights via
BlackRock Sustainable Investing Intelligence™, a
proprietary investment framework, along with thematic
research publications, custom analytics, advisory solutions,
and innovative product development.
Sustainable Investing Technology
Aladdin® is BlackRock9s end-to-end portfolio management
software that combines sophisticated risk analytics with
portfolio management, trading, and operations tools on a
single, unified platform. In 2020, BlackRock launched an
initiative to build new sustainability -focused capabilities
within Aladdin. Aladdin Sustainability and Aladdin
Sustainability Lab were formed with a vision to power the
shift to sustainable investing by integrating sustainability
data, analytics, and functionalities into investors9 daily
workflows to drive more informed investment and risk
management.
This effort includes Aladdin Climate, a platform that seeks to
help investors uncover investment risks and opportunities
associated with both the physical impacts of a changing
climate and the uncertain transition to a net zero world.
Aladdin Climate provides scenario analysis capabilities,
helping investors consider how climate-related risks and
opportunities may evolve and their potential business
implications under different physical and transition risk
scenarios. Please see Risks, Opportunities & Scenario
Analysis –Climate Scenario Analysis (page 24) within
BlackRock9s 2021 TCFD Report for a discussion of climate
risk scenario analysis conducted by BlackRock.
In addition to Aladdin Climate, BlackRock has integrated
more than 8,000 ESG-related data points into Aladdin from
leading third-party ESG data providers. This integrated data
provides users the ability to analyze the ESG profile of their
portfolios and portfolio holdings, bringing in historical data
and forward-looking impact analytics alongside more
traditional risk metrics.
In addition to Aladdin9s capabilities, BlackRock maintains
sustainable investing technologies that cater to the unique
needs of alternative market investors. eFrontÆ is BlackRock's
technology solution for alternative investment management,
covering the needs of alternative investment professionals
end-to-end. Investment professionals in alternative asset
classes have a growing need to access ESG data to help
identify risk and opportunities. In 2021, eFront launched
ESG Outreach, an extension of BlackRock9s eFront Insight
platform, a leader in digitalizing private market data. ESG
Outreach gathers and analyzes a standardized set of ESG
data for the needs of the whole alternatives ecosystem and
aims to provide a consistent ESG framework, aligned with
existing regulatory and reporting initiatives.
<Climate Aware= Capital Markets Assumptions
The BlackRock Investment Institute provides investors with
<climate-aware= capital market assumptions, which are
long-term asset class estimates of risk and return that
account for the impact of climate change and the net zero
transition across asset classes. The climate-aware capital
market assumptions are the core set of assumptions used by
many BlackRock portfolio managers to construct strategic
asset allocations.

Description of proxy voting and investee engagement policies and procedures

Investment Stewardship

As a fiduciary, clients depend on BlackRock to help them
achieve their investment goals. These clients include public
and private pension plans, governments, insurance
companies, endowments, universities, charities, and
ultimately individual investors, among others. The
Blackrock Investment Stewardship team9s (<BIS=) purpose
is to support companies in their efforts to create long term
durable financial performance on behalf of BlackRock9s
clients. BIS serves as an important link between
BlackRock9s clients and the companies they invest in —and
the trust BlackRock9s clients place in us gives us a great
responsibility to advocate on their behalf. The BIS team is
responsible for engaging with companies in which
BlackRock invests on behalf of clients, as well as voting
proxies for those clients who have given us authority. We
are interested in hearing from companies about their
strategies for navigating the challenges and capturing the
opportunities they face. As BlackRock is a long -term
investor on behalf of our clients, the business and
governance decisions that companies make will have a
direct impact on BlackRock9s clients9 investment outcomes
and financial well-being.
Consistent with our leadership position in the industry,
BlackRock has invested to establish one of the industry9s
largest investment stewardship teams. BIS is organized
regionally, reflecting the different regulatory requirements,
corporate governance standards, and client expectations in
different jurisdictions. In addition, there is global oversight
of centralized BIS functions related to daily operations,
research, policy, and communications. The team has grown
steadily from 13 members in 2009 to nearly 70 members as
of year-end 2021. Located across ten global offices, the
team has global presence and local expertise across the 57
countries in which BIS engaged companies.
Engagement Priority Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Board quality
and
effectiveness
Quality leadership is essential to
performance. Board composition,
effectiveness, diversity, and
accountability remain top priorities
Board effectiveness –A core component of BIS9 work to advance our clients9 financial
interests is direct engagement with a board member, so that BIS can provide direct
feedback from our perspective as a long-term shareholder. For those companies with
which BIS wishes to engage to understand their board9s role, BIS seeks dialogue with
the most appropriate non-executive, and preferably independent, director(s) who has
been identified by the company as having a responsibility to meet with shareholders.
Board quality - BIS looks to companies to disclose their approach to ensuring
meaningful board diversity and encourages the board to set out the self-identified
demographic profiles of the directors in aggregate, consistent with local law, and how
this aligns with the company9s strategy and business model.
Strategy,
purpose,
and financial
resilience
A purpose driven long-term strategy,
underpinned by sound capital
management, supports financial
resilience
In discussing their corporate strategy and financial resilience, BIS encourages
companies to set out how they have integrated business relevant sustainability risks
and opportunities. To aid investor understanding, companies can demonstrate in
their disclosures how they are aligning their strategy with their purpose to address
these risks and opportunities and create long -term value, evidenced by metrics
relevant to their business model. BIS appreciates when companies disclose industry-
or company-specific metrics to support their narrative on how they have considered
key stakeholders9 interests in their business decision-making.
Incentives
aligned
with value
creation
Appropriate incentives reward
executives for delivering sustainable
long-term value creation
BIS looks to companies to disclose incentives that are aligned with long -term value
creation and sustained financial performance, underpinned by material and rigorous
metrics that align with the company9s long-term strategic goals.

Engagement Priority Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Climate and
natural capital
Business plans with targets to
advance the transition to a low-

natural capital dependencies and
impacts through sustainable
business practices
Climate —BIS appreciates when companies discuss in their reporting how their
business model is aligned to a scenario in which global warming is limited to well below
2∞C, moving towards global net zero emissions by 2050. Companies help investors
understand their approach when they provide disclosures aligned with the four pillars of
the TCFD—including Scope 1 and 2 emissions, along with short-, medium-, and long-
term science-based reduction targets, where available for their sector.
Natural Capital —BIS looks to companies to disclose detailed information on their
approach to managing material natural capital-related business risks and opportunities,
including how their business models are consistent with the sustainable use and
management of natural resources such as air, water, land, minerals, and forests.
Company
impacts

Sustainable business practices
create enduring value for key
stakeholders –employees,
customers, suppliers, and
communities
BIS looks to companies to demonstrate a robust approach to human capital
management and provide shareholders with the necessary information to understand
how their approach aligns with their stated strategy and business model.
BIS appreciates when companies disclose the actions they are taking to support a diverse
and engaged workforce, and how that aligns with their strategy and business model.
BIS looks to companies to discuss in their disclosures how the board oversees
management9s approach to due diligence and remediation of adverse impacts to people
arising from their business practices.
The aforementioned Engagement Priorities were published in February 2022.
* Any information relating to forward-looking statements, goals, and progress against goals was not subject to Deloitte9s review and, accordingly, Deloitte does not express a conclusion or
any form of assurance on such information.
BIS Global Principles
BIS9 approach to corporate governance and stewardship is
outlined in its Global Principles. The Global Principles
describe BIS9 stewardship philosophy and views on
corporate governance and resilient business models that
may support long-term value creation by companies. The
Global Principles^9 cover seven key themes: (i) boards and
directors; (ii) auditors and audit-related issues; (iii) capital
structure, mergers, asset sales, and other special transactions;
(iv) compensation and benefits; (v) environmental and social
issues; (vi) general corporate governance matters and
shareholder protections; and (vii) shareholder proposals.
Regional and market-specific voting guidelines explain how
the Global Principles inform voting decisions in relation to
specific ballot items for shareholder meetings, taking into
consideration local market standards and norms.
Voting choice
Over the past five decades, innovation and regulatory
support have led to a greater choice and democratization in
investing strategies, structures, and products. Greater
choice now extends to shareholder proxy voting. Many
investors are looking to exercise greater control over their
voting for the companies in their index equity portfolios,
and technology has made this more easily available.
BlackRock Voting Choice introduced more voting options
for institutional clients invested in certain pooled funds
while also making voting easier for institutional clients
invested in separately managed accounts, who have long
had this option. The ease of use, implementation, and
accessibility by providing greater choice for investors in
separate accounts and certain pooled vehicles to vote their
shares has been met with great interest by our clients.
BlackRock Voting Choice currently allows these investors to
vote their shares in line with their preferences via four main
options, which includes the opportunity to continue to
authorize BlackRock9s stewardship team to vote on their behalf.
BlackRock Voting Choice is seen as a natural extension of
our efforts to bring greater choice to our clients and to
empower them with greater options and ease around how
they want to engage with their money. For further
information on BlackRock Voting Choice, please see BIS9
latest paper, 8It9s All About Choice9, under this disclosure9s
Additional Resources on page 40.
Approach to Engagement
Engagement is core to BIS9 efforts, enabling the team9s
analysts to improve their understanding of the business
risks and opportunities that are material to the companies in
which our clients invest, including those related to ESG
matters. Engagement also informs BIS9 voting decisions. As
long-term investors on behalf of clients, BIS seeks to have
regular and continuing dialogue with executives and board
directors to advance sound governance, as well as to
understand the effectiveness of the company9s management
and oversight of material issues.
BIS reviews and refreshes the team9s engagement priorities
each year. BIS9 engagement priorities provide clients with
insight into how BIS is conducting engagement and voting
activities on key governance and sustainability issues BIS
believes are critical drivers of a company9s ability to deliver
durable, long-term financial returns on their behalf. Some
issues have long been core components of BIS9 work.

Exhibit 3: BIS Engagement Priorities - Alignment with Sustainable Development Goals*
Sustainable Development Goals
The aforementioned BIS Engagement Priorities - Alignment with SDGs were published in February 2022.
Others have become priorities more recently, driven by BIS9
observations of emerging risks and opportunities for
companies, market developments, and changing client and
societal expectations.
Many of the topics that BIS discusses with companies
intersect with aspects of the SDGs in which the private
sector has a role to play. Exhibit 3 shows how BIS9
engagement priorities align with the SDGs, where relevant
to a company9s governance and business practices.
Approach to Proxy Voting
BIS votes on behalf of those clients who have given
BlackRock authority to do so. When exercising clients9
voting rights, BIS votes in accordance with its published
voting guidelines for the relevant market, which are applied
on a case-by-case basis. BIS updates the regional voting
guidelines annually to reflect changes in market standards
and to help companies understand the team9s views on
emerging corporate governance issues.
As a long-term investor, we generally support companies
when our engagement affirms that they are taking
appropriate steps to address shareholders9 concerns.
However, when concerns persist despite ongoing
engagement, or a company9s actions do not seem aligned
with long-term value creation, we may signal our concerns
in our voting on behalf of clients.
Approach to Shareholder Proposals
In many markets in which BlackRock invests on behalf of
clients, shareholders have the right to submit proposals to
be voted on by shareholders at a company9s annual or
extraordinary meeting, as long as eligibility and procedural
requirements are met. The matters put forward by
shareholders address a wide range of topics, including
governance reforms, capital management, and
improvements in the management or disclosure of
environmental and social risks. In 2021 BIS voted on more
than 164,000^10 total proposals; 829 of those were
shareholder proposals,^11 representing less than 1% of
total proposals.
BlackRock does not submit shareholder proposals, but we
still can vote on shareholder proposals put forth by others.
BlackRock complies with requirements under various laws
and regulations that limit how BlackRock can interact with
the companies in which it invests on behalf of its clients. As
with all voting, when assessing how to vote on shareholder
proposals, BIS evaluates each proposal on its merit, taking
a case-by-case approach with a singular focus on its
implications for long-term value creation. More information
on our approach is in our Global Principles. An example of
how BIS applies a case-by-case approach is explained in
the commentary <2022 Climate-related shareholder
proposals more prescriptive than 2021=.
Approach to Environmental Risks & Opportunities
As an asset manager, BlackRock9s approach to climate risk
and opportunities and the global energy transition is based
on our fundamental role as a fiduciary to our clients. As the
world works towards a transition to a low-carbon economy,
BIS is interested in hearing from companies about their
strategies and plans for responding to the challenges and
capturing the opportunities this transition creates. As
BlackRock is a long-term investor on behalf of our clients,
how well companies navigate and adapt through the
transition will have a direct impact on our clients9
investment outcomes and financial well-being.
In this context, BIS seeks to understand companies9 plans
for how they intend to deliver long-term financial
performance through the energy transition, consistent with
their business model, sector, and geography. BIS looks for
companies to demonstrate they have strategies in place
that address and are resilient to a range of scenarios,
including likely decarbonization pathways well below 2∞C,
as well as global ambitions to limit temperature rise to
1.5∞C.^12 BIS also encourages companies to disclose how
considerations related to having a reliable energy supply
and just transition affect their plans. For information about
BIS9 engagements with companies and approach to climate
risk, please see BIS9 commentary: <Climate Risk and the
Global Energy Transition=. For information regarding BIS9
approach to engagement on natural capital, please see BIS 9
commentary: <Our Approach to Engagement on Natural
Capital.= Please also see the response provided under
Management Criteria 6.
Approach to Human Capital Management
BIS views Human Capital Management (<HCM=) as both a
board and a management issue. In BIS9 experience,
companies that build strong relationships with their
stakeholders –including their workforce –are more likely to
meet their own strategic objectives, while poor
relationships may create adverse impacts that could expose
companies to legal, regulatory, operational, and
reputational risks, and jeopardize their license to operate.
This is why BIS encourages companies to report on how
they consider the interests of their workforce in business
decision-making. For information about BIS9 engagements
with companies and approach to human capital
management, please see BIS9 commentary: <Our Approach
to Engagement on Human Capital Management=.
Approach to Human Rights
BIS engages with companies to understand how they are
monitoring and managing their impacts on people,
including human rights-related risks. For information
about BIS9 approach to engagement with companies on
their human rights impacts, please see BIS9 commentary:
<Our Approach to Engagement with Companies on their
Human Rights Impacts=. Please also see the discussion
under Management Criteria 4 for information about BIS9
approach to human rights-related risks.
Commitment to Transparency
BIS is committed to providing transparency into its
stewardship activities on behalf of clients. Since January
2020, BlackRock has enhanced existing disclosures and
initiated others, including, vote bulletins covering BIS9
voting rationale on key proposals at specific meetings that
may be of particular interest to clients, annual and mid -
year thematic reports and position papers explaining BIS9
approach to engagement with companies on governance
and sustainability issues. BIS also makes company -specific
engagement activity available quarterly, along with its
voting record.

Whistleblower Policies

BlackRock maintains a Global Policy for Reporting Illegal or

Unethical Conduct, which establishes the framework by

which an employee or any third-party may report a concern.

BlackRock makes available a Business Integrity Hotline and

reporting website, which is administered on behalf of

BlackRock by an independent external third-party.

The Code provides an overview of the Global Policy for

Reporting Illegal or Unethical Conduct. BlackRock employees

are required to complete a mandatory compliance training

annually on topics that cover employee responsibilities

included in the Code and the Global Policy for Reporting

Illegal and Unethical Conduct.

Every BlackRock employee is required to report any illegal or

unethical conduct about which they become aware, as

outlined in the Code, including those concerning accounting

or auditing matters and violations of BlackRock policies.

Employees may report concerns to their managers or a
Managing Director on BlackRock9s Legal & Compliance
team directly, or by contacting the Business Integrity
Hotline or reporting website.
Anti-Bribery and Corruption

BlackRock9s Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy explicitly
prohibits any transaction, including facilitation payments,
which could constitute a bribe or a corrupt payment to or
from a public official or body, or a private entity or individual.
BlackRock9s policy applies to its employees and to those who
represent the firm, including any business partners who
operate on BlackRock9s behalf. BlackRock considers the anti-
bribery and corruption policies of potential new business
partners as it conducts its due diligence. BlackRock has a

Vendor Sustainability & Diversity

BlackRock is a financial services company, its <supply chain=

is comprised primarily of vendors, custodian banks and fund

administrators, trading counterparties, market data providers,

and other entities that support BlackRock9s activities and

business operations (collectively, <Suppliers=).

Risks & Opportunities

As a participant of the UNGC, BlackRock is committed to

aligning its operations with universal principles on human

rights, labor, the environment, and anti-corruption. BlackRock

has established expectations for the companies and

individuals who supply goods, materials, or services to

BlackRock to adhere to these same standards and principles,

or their equivalent.

By adopting high expectations for its Suppliers, encouraging

best practices in both diversity, equity, and inclusion and

environmental sustainability, and fostering the growth and

development of veteran, minority, LGBTQ+, and women-

owned businesses, BlackRock has the opportunity to increase

its effectiveness as an organization and build stronger

relationships with its Suppliers and the communities in which

it operates. In addition, BlackRock recognizes the importance

of managing risks that could arise from ineffective

management of environmental and social issues by its

Suppliers.

Supplier Code of Conduct & Ethics

BlackRock maintains a Supplier Code of Conduct & Ethics,

which outlines the minimum expectations and standards of

Suppliers in relation to human rights, DEI, environmental

sustainability, and integrity, ethics, and anti-corruption in

management practices as BlackRock believes that effective

management of these issues, including adherence to

applicable laws and regulations, reduces potential risk to

BlackRock and its Suppliers. In 2021, BlackRock updated its

Supplier Code of Conduct & Ethics to embed the Ten

Principles of the UNGC into its stated expectations for

Suppliers and to incorporate recommended best practices

that BlackRock encourages its Suppliers to adopt, where

appropriate, including being transparent about their diversity

competitive bid events.
Diverse Broker Program
BlackRock maintains a dedicated <Diverse Broker= program
which looks to proactively engage with minority, women,
and/or veteran owned broker-dealers in the US to help them
become stronger liquidity providers in the broader
marketplace. The program looks to: 1) identify ways to increase
BlackRock9s connectivity and trading activities with Diverse
Brokers while introducing new opportunities for these firms to
become more competitive in the broader marketplace; and 2)

obligations to seek best execution and meet independent
counterparty credit risk assessment criteria.
Diverse Manager Program

Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (<DEI=)

BlackRock is committed to embedding DEI across every

level of the firm and within every region and country where it

operates. BlackRock9s clear sense of purpose to help more

and more people experience financial well-being is core to

who it is as a firm and to the difference it can make in the

world. A diverse workforce engaged in BlackRock9s purpose

is foundational to its ability to deliver value to its

stakeholders including clients, employees, shareholders,

and communities.

DEI Strategy

BlackRock has made a long-term commitment to cultivating

diversity in its workforce and leadership team through its

hiring, retention, promotion, and development practices. As

a part of this long-term commitment, BlackRock instituted a

multi-year DEI strategy in March 2021 that is actionable

and measurable with global and local relevance. BlackRock

reviews the strategy annually, along with the corporate

policies and programs that support it, so that the strategy

remains aligned with the firm9s business imperatives and

long-term objectives. BlackRock9s DEI strategy centers on

three core pillars: (i) talent and culture: (ii) responding to the

needs of its clients: (iii) policy and social impact in the

communities in which it operates. Please see Management

Criteria 1 and SASB FN-AC-410a.3 for further detail on

BlackRock9s role as a fiduciary on behalf of its clients. Please

also see Management Criteria 5 and Management Criteria 9

for more on BlackRock9s commitment to public policy and

social impact.

To accelerate progress, BlackRock has committed to raising

awareness of racial equity issues and setting high

behavioral expectations for employees, as well as to holding

firm leaders and managers accountable for continued

progress against the firm9s goals. In 2020, BlackRock set

goals for increasing the overall workplace representation of

Black and Latinx employees by 30% in the US and doubling

the number of US Black and Latinx senior leaders (Director

and above) by 2024. Recruitment, retention, and promotions

are the key levers enabling BlackRock to reach its 2024

goals. In addition, as BlackRock continued to consider the

18

Employee Diversity & Inclusion

development and retention of its employees, the firm
invested in comprehensive leadership development
programs. See below for more detail on leadership
development.
Governance
BlackRock9s Board of Directors (the <Board=) plays an
important role in the oversight of human capital
management at BlackRock. The Board devotes an annual
meeting to conduct an in-depth review of BlackRock9s
human capital strategy which includes, but is not limited to,
talent acquisition and talent management, the DEI strategy,
leadership and succession planning, employee sentiment,
and employee engagement. BlackRock9s vision for talent is
for every employee to live and embrace the BlackRock
Principles, the firm9s cultural values, and to have its
employees fully engaged and enabled in helping more and
more people experience financial well-being, which is the
firm9s purpose. Partnership between Human Resources
(<HR=) and the business is critical to enabling this vision.
BlackRock senior management made it a priority in 2021 to
establish and maintain firmwide DEI governance models to
accelerate progress against its multi-year global DEI strategy
and commitments.
To do so, BlackRock launched the Global Diversity, Equity,
and Inclusion Steering Committee (<GDSC=). The GDSC is
comprised of 25 BlackRock leaders, across regions and
functions, who work collaboratively to accelerate the firm9s
progress on DEI firm-wide. Members have a proven track
record of influencing and progressing DEI within their
respective businesses and have a unique ability to bring
innovative ideas to fulfilling the firm9s DEI mission.
In addition, approximately 40 senior executives representing
different business groups took on the role of DEI Executive
Committee Lead. They develop, drive and are accountable to
the DEI action plan for their respective businesses. These key
decision makers on Executive Committee-level teams can
initiate DEI discussions and dialogues during Executive
Committee meetings and across their businesses. They each
identify DEI priorities for their business with their Chief
Operating Officers and HR business partners and keep their
Executive Committee team accountable to deliver against
specific DEI objectives and plans.

Accountability
In 2021, BlackRock further developed its accountability
system to drive greater collective ownership of the firm9s
DEI efforts by:
Implementing business-specific DEI goals,
establishing clear action plans, and reviewing
business-specific progress at mid and end of year with
each of its businesses and functions.
Embedding DEI into BlackRock9s talent, performance
management, and promotion processes by explicitly
including strengths and areas for improvement in
promoting an inclusive, respectful, and equitable work
environment and culture.
Providing greater disclosure on diversity, including the
release of its Global DEI Annual Report.
Feedback Mechanisms
BlackRock values continuous dialogue with its employees
about their experiences at the firm in order to understand
employee expectations and assess the efficacy of its
human capital management practices. The Company uses
several employee feedback mechanisms, including: (i)
employee opinion surveys; (ii) interactive townhalls and
communications; and (iii) employee, professional, and
social impact networks. These employee engagement
mechanisms provide BlackRock with actionable feedback
for each team and for BlackRock as a whole.
Recruiting
In 2021, BlackRock launched its DEI Center of Excellence
within Talent Acquisition (<TA=) with four strategic areas of
focus around partnerships, hiring practices, projects, and
DEI thought leadership.
BlackRock seeks to hire diverse teams as it believes diverse
teams lead to better decision-making, especially in
complex, changing environments. BlackRock regularly
reviews job postings for potentially biased language and
actively engages in outreach and recruitment efforts for its
open positions to endeavor to have candidate slates that
are diverse, including with respect to gender, race, ethnicity,
disability, veteran status, and beyond. BlackRock also
designed a recruitment process to mitigate bias through
hiring manager training on competency -based interviewing
and has implemented diverse interview panel guidelines.
BlackRock has seen significant increases in its recruitment
of diverse talent over the past three years. In 2021, nearly
half of all hires were women (46.9%), bringing the firm9s
global female representation to 43.5% as of January 1,
In the US, 28% of overall hires in 2021 identified as
Asian, 14% identified as Black or African American, and 9%
identified as Hispanic or Latinx. Over the past several years,
BlackRock has also made progress in its campus recruiting
program. Globally, 55% of its 2021 Graduate Analysts are
women. In the US, 23% of Graduate Analysts in 2021
identified as Asian, 19% identified as Black or African
American, and 15% identified as Hispanic or Latinx.
Leadership Development
BlackRock believes that a critical driver of its future growth
is its ability to grow strong leaders. BlackRock is committed
to sponsoring diverse talent through targeted development
programs designed to foster career growth. For example,
eligible employees from underrepresented backgrounds are
invited to participate in BlackRock9s flagship leadership
programs, which include assessments, executive coaching,
in-person and virtual learning, and senior management
sponsorship. In 2021, BlackRock designed a comprehensive,
ecosystem-focused approach intended to develop the
individual leader and influence the system around them to
better enable their growth and success. For example,
BlackRock invites managers of program participants to
participate in training that focuses on inclusive leadership,
cultural competency skills and deepening and building
high-quality relationships with leaders from
underrepresented groups.
Employee Learning
The firm understands that progress requires a long -term
mindset with sustained focus and persistence. Belonging
and inclusion are integral to bringing the firm9s shared
purpose and values to life. One way BlackRock is furthering
its efforts in this journey is by raising awareness of and
educating its employees on issues related to DEI and the
systemic barriers many underrepresented individuals face
in the workplace. In 2021, BlackRock hosted <Inclusion
Dialogue= sessions, virtual small group conversations led
by external facilitators that helped build the skills necessary
to cultivate inclusive environments.
Reinforcing BlackRock9s culture is critical to its continued
success and moving the organization forward. Ensuring all
employees are grounded in BlackRock9s history, the
BlackRock Principles and the firm9s purpose is more
important than ever. To that end, in October 2021, the firm
introduced the BlackRock Citizen Academy (<BCZA=) –a
suite of courses and content designed to ensure every
employee has a foundational knowledge of BlackRock9s
business and a stake in its culture. Foundations of Our
Culture, a required accreditation within BCZA, further
embeds diversity, equity and inclusion throughout its
content and delivery experience.
Employee Networks
BlackRock employee networks provide an opportunity for
employees with a diverse range of backgrounds,
experiences, and perspectives to connect with one another
and help shape BlackRock9s culture. Employee networks are
sponsored by senior leaders and are proudly designed by
employees, for employees. BlackRock9s first network, the
Women9s Initiative & Allies Network was established in
BlackRock has 15 employee, professional, and social
impact networks, which come together in a forum called
Mosaic. Mosaic works across many populations and groups
within the firm to focus on shared interests. It is open to all
employees and is a forum to share best practices, showcase
BlackRock9s 2021 Sustainability Disclosure 19

comradery and reinforce the One BlackRock mindset.
BlackRock continues to add new networks to support its
employees. In March 2021, BlackRock launched two new
networks, the Asian Middle Eastern & Allies Professional
Network, and the Gives Network, which is a global
community of employees committed to making a positive
impact in the places where they live and work through
volunteerism, fundraising, and pro-bono support.

employees in certain geographies including those in the
US, UK, and Hong Kong. BlackRock offers life, accident,
disability, and travel insurance to help protect its eligible
employees9 financial security. BlackRock9s Education
Reimbursement Program offers benefits -eligible
employees up to $5,250 (or equivalent in local currency)
per year to help employees expand the skills and knowledge
to help them build their careers. Blackrock offers employees
a financial counseling benefit through Ayco. The Ayco
benefit provides US employees with an integrated solution
that blends digital tools and education with unlimited one-
on-one financial coaching
Sustainable Investing Options in BlackRock
Retirement Plans
Sustainable investing options are available to employees in
many of BlackRock9s global retirement plans including
those in the US, UK, Hong Kong, Australia, Belgium, Japan,
Netherlands, South Korea, and Sweden. Investment choices
available to employees differ from country to country
depending on the availability, cost, and quality of
sustainable investing options and any applicable laws and
regulations, including those governing the types of funds
that are eligible as a default investment.
Health and Physical Well-being
BlackRock9s medical plans are designed to help benefits-
eligible employees maintain their health and well-being,
with a focus on comprehensive coverage, preventive care,
and virtual access where available. Throughout the COVID-
19 pandemic, BlackRock focused on enhancing access to
telemedicine support, where available. BlackRock9s global
well-being platform, powered by Virgin Pulse, helps
employees build healthy habits so they can be more
successful in their everyday lives. This encompasses tips,
incentives, and BlackRock-sponsored challenges to
support better eating, sleep, and exercise, including access
to a free library of over 1,000 virtual fitness classes.
Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, BlackRock9s
priority has been the health and safety of its employees and
their families. As such, BlackRock provided a voluntary,
company paid COVID-19 testing benefit, designed to make
testing for COVID-19 and its antibodies more accessible
and convenient to its global employees and their
dependents. BlackRock also offered employees COVID-19
vaccines education and access onsite, where available.
Emotional Well-being
BlackRock9s health plans cover mental health, and
BlackRock offers a variety of emotional and mental health
benefits that are available to benefits-eligible employees,
including confidential counseling through BlackRock9s
Employee Assistance Program (<EAP=). The EAP is designed
to support employees and their families across a wide
range of needs, offering emergency assistance, as well as
counseling, by telephone or in person, for personal stress
and family problems, including marital and relationship
difficulties, financial worries, anxiety, and emotional issues.
The EAP also provides work and life resources, as well as
everyday support through research and referral services.
To help reduce stress and improve sleep, BlackRock offers
employees a free annual subscription to the Calm App. In
2021, BlackRock introduced a Mental Health Ambassador
program with more than 400 volunteers across the firm
who have been trained in empathetic listening skills and
refer colleagues to the benefits, tools, and resources that
BlackRock offers to support mental health.
Volunteering & Donation Matching
BlackRock has a matching gifts program that provides
benefits-eligible employees with up to US $10,000 per year
in matched donations and volunteer time to any IRS
qualified charitable organization.
Benefits-eligible employees are also given two paid
volunteer days per year. BlackRock also matches volunteer
time with eligible charities at US $25 per hour. Through
local, employee-led BlackRock Gives committees,
BlackRock supports nonprofit organizations nominated by
employees in the communities where BlackRock operates.
Life Management
BlackRock9s flexible time off policy offers benefits-eligible
employees as many paid days off per year as they need,
with manager approval. BlackRock also provides leave
through a variety of policies and programs, depending on
BlackRock9s 2021 Sustainability Disclosure 23
the reason for the leave. BlackRock9s inclusive time off
benefits for employees also include paid leave following the
birth or adoption of a child for both primary and non-
primary caregivers. BlackRock supports benefits -eligible
employees by offering a flexible return-to-work transition
period for primary caregivers. BlackRock offers a
reimbursement benefit to eligible employees to help offset
the costs associated with adopting a child and/or
completing a surrogacy arrangement, where legally
permissible. In 2021, BlackRock began offering an
enhanced bereavement leave policy and introduced a paid
leave for parents who have the unfortunate experience of a
miscarriage or stillbirth.
Human Rights & Labor Standards

Management Criteria 4

Description of engagement process and due diligence practices with respect to management of
human rights, indigenous rights, and the local community
As defined by the United Nations Universal Declaration of
Human Rights, human rights are inherent to all human
beings and include the right to life, health and well-being,
privacy, fair wages, and decent working conditions; freedom
from discrimination, slavery, and torture; and freedom of
association.^15
BlackRock approaches human rights from two main
perspectives:
As an asset manager with a responsibility to manage
material risks to client portfolios, including how the firm
engages with companies on their human rights impacts;
and
As a corporate entity that seeks to support and respect
the protection of international human rights in the
management of BlackRock9s employees, operations, and
supply chain.
Asset Management

Investment Stewardship: A discussion of BlackRock9s
approach to investment stewardship is provided under FN -
AC-410a.3. BIS engages on material business issues. BIS
believes companies are best placed to deliver value for
shareholders when they also consider the interests of their
other key stakeholders. BIS is committed to engaging with
companies on how they manage the human rights issues
that are inherent in their businesses and monitor human
rights practices on a best-efforts basis. BIS9 assessment is
based on information in the public domain, including third -
party research.
While BIS engages with companies, and where appropriate,
may not support management in our voting on behalf of
clients, BIS lacks the authority to direct companies to
address weaknesses in their business practices. Rather, the
responsibility for managing human rights issues –and all
business practices –lies with boards and management of
companies and the governments that regulate them.
Governments and other public policy makers are
responsible for implementing and enforcing relevant laws
and regulations in their respective markets. BIS does not
engage with governments on these issues. Yet, BIS believes
that, over time, the approach that the stewardship team
and other investors take to evaluating and engaging with
companies on their human rights impacts can encourage
companies to integrate sound business practices that
benefit relevant stakeholders over the long -term. The
following case studies illustrate BIS9 engagement and
voting related to human rights matters in 2021:
At the January 2021 Annual General Meeting (<AGM=) of
the Malaysia-based Top Glove Corporation Bhd(<Top
Glove=) – the world9s largest rubber gloves manufacturer
BIS did not support the re-election of six Independent
Non-Executive Directors (<INEDs=). BIS also did not
support a proposal for the Senior Independent Director
to continue as an INED. Given the company9s role as a
leading personal protective equipment manufacturer
and as a supplier of such equipment to hospitals around
the world, BIS viewed the company9s ineffectiveness in
implementing COVID-19 protections for its own
workforce as especially concerning. Prior to COVID-19,
Top Glove had already faced serious financial and
reputational impacts, after the US Customs and Border
Protection (<CBP=) determined that there was reasonable
evidence of forced labor at Top Glove9s manufacturing
facilities. Following the 2021 AGM, Top Glove was
proactive in engaging with various stakeholders,
including BIS. The company has provided regular
updates of the measures it adopted to address the
various worker health and safety issues as well as labor
rights concerns. On September 9, 2021, the US CBP
announced the modification of the forced labor finding
on Top Glove.^16 The US CBP communicated it had
reviewed the evidence provided by Top Glove and
determined that the company had addressed all
indicators of forced labor identified at its Malaysian
manufacturing facilities. BIS acknowledged the progress
demonstrated by the company and will continue to
monitor the various measures aimed at improving labor
conditions in its facilities and across its operations. Read
more about this case in the BIS Vote Bulletin.^17
At its June 2021 AGM, Thomson Reuters Corporation
(<Thomson Reuters=) –a business information services
company –put to a vote a shareholder proposal asking
the company to broadly assess human rights risk and
compare its human rights risk mitigation practices to its
peers. The shareholder proposal made specific reference
to Thomson Reuters9 announced change in strategy to
become a content-driven technology company.^18 In
advance of the AGM, BIS engaged with Thomson Reuters
to gain further understanding of its policies around
board oversight and human rights risk in light of their
new business focus. Technology companies are playing
an increasingly important role in both the global
economy and society. With that influence comes
increased responsibility to consider how the use of
personal data is integrated into a company9s strategy,
and how this information is protected. While Thomson
Reuters was able to detail some efforts to integrate
additional oversight, which included the adoption of the
<AI Principles= in 2020, BIS determined that more
progress in this area would be beneficial to the company
as it looks to reposition itself strategically. BIS voted in
support of the shareholder proposal as the team believed
the company could accelerate the implementation of
policies to help mitigate future legal, operational, and
reputational risk and support long-term shareholder
value.
ESG Integration & Risk Management : Investment teams
that have greater potential exposure to human rights,
indigenous rights and local community violations consider
these issues during portfolio construction and
management. For example, the BAI Real Assets team
considers these issues and risk exposure during asset
review and due diligence. Where applicable, the BAI Real
Assets team reviews factors such as land rights and
community impact and rights. Examples of the team9s
efforts include seeking informed consent for projects from
local or indigenous communities where applicable,
undertaking detailed reviews of land rights as part of
investment due diligence, and aligning community and
social engagement best practice with the International
Finance Corporation9s (<IFC=) Performance Standards for
several of its emerging market strategies.^19 BlackRock9s
Real Assets team also regularly reviews and monitors on-
site health and safety, in addition to wider community
engagements and impacts. BlackRock Real Assets uses
commercially reasonable efforts to comply with all relevant
jurisdictional laws and expects BlackRock9s appointed
contractors to do the same.
Fundamental investors also consider these issues using a
range of tools to identify potential risk and exposure levels
such as third-party provider controversy scores. If a
concern is identified, fundamental investors may engage
with companies to understand these risks, which will inform
portfolio construction and management. Companies
classified as UN Global Compact violators will also be
flagged where relevant and material during regular Risk
and Quantitative Analysis review meetings as well as Chief
Investment Officer portfolio reviews.
Please see FN-AC-410a.2 for more information on ESG
integration.
Transparency : BlackRock manages a variety of different
products, each with their own investment strategy,
guidelines, and constraints. BlackRock9s goal is for
investors to be able to clearly see the sustainability
characteristics of their investments. As such, ESG metrics
including business involvement exposures (such as UNGC
violators) based on third-party data sources are made
publicly available for publicly offered funds including
iShares ETFs and BlackRock mutual funds, where
permitted by local and applicable regulation and where
data is available. These metrics are also provided to
separate account portfolio clients upon request, where
permitted and applicable.
Corporate Operations

As a participant of the UNGC, BlackRock is committed to
aligning its operations with universal principles on human
rights, labor, environment, and anti-corruption, and to
taking actions that advance societal goals.
BlackRock has implemented policies related to non-
harassment, equal employment opportunity, and
acceptable conditions of work with respect to wages, hours
of work and occupational safety and health. These policies
seek to provide applicants and employees equal
opportunity without regard to legally protected
characteristics that have attracted historical stereotyping
or bias in relation to employment. BlackRock complies with
all applicable laws and regulations on forced and child
labor and the rights of association and to organize and
bargain collectively.
Non-Harassment
BlackRock9s non-harassment policy details its commitment
to providing equal employment opportunities and a
workplace that is respectful, productive, and free from
harassment, including, but not limited to, sexual
BlackRock9s 2021 Sustainability Disclosure 24

harassment. This policy outlines clear procedures for
reporting and responding to issues of concern. BlackRock
investigates all complaints raised in good faith. If
BlackRock determines that an employee has engaged in
activities that are in violation of, or inconsistent with the
policy, the firm will take appropriate disciplinary action, up
to and including termination of employment.
Employees are required to complete <Respect in the
Workplace= training, which focuses on creating a respectful
work environment and on preventing harassment and
discrimination, including sexual harassment. Managers
receive targeted training on their responsibility for
preventing harassment and discrimination and escalating
concerns of which they become aware regarding violations
of policy. All employees are strongly encouraged to raise
concerns regarding violations of BlackRock9s policy.
Employees have numerous options for reporting concerns,
including their manager, HR Business Partner, Employee
Relations Advisor, BlackRock9s US EEO Officer, and
BlackRock9s Business Integrity Hotline and reporting
website, which permits anonymity, if desired. BlackRock
expressly prohibits retaliation against any individual who
reports a concern or assists with an inquiry or investigation.
BlackRock takes complaints of discrimination, harassment,
and retaliation very seriously. The firm takes steps to
respect confidentiality in conducting any investigation
(recognizing that some disclosure may be necessary to
investigate the complaint effectively).
Equal Employment Opportunity
Since its founding, BlackRock has been committed to equal
employment opportunity for all applicants and existing
employees. BlackRock is also committed to seeking ways in
which affirmative actions can help reinforce this
commitment. BlackRock developed and implemented its
US Affirmative Action Program to ensure that good faith
efforts are made to provide equal employment opportunity
to every employee and qualified potential employee.
BlackRock also fully supports the Americans with
Disabilities Act and other relevant local laws by taking steps
to attract and hire qualified individuals with disabilities, as
well as engaging in an interactive process in response to
requests for reasonable job accommodations during the
application process, hiring process, and during
employment. The firm also is committed to the recruitment,
outreach, and development of disabled and protected
veterans. It actively recruits with veteran organizations and,
through its Veteran Employee Network, hosts a variety of
events to highlight the value of transferrable military skills
and experiences.
Each employee is responsible for complying with
BlackRock9s equal employment opportunity and non-
harassment policies at all times. All managers share the
responsibility of assuring compliance with and continued
implementation of these policies and are required to report
any concerns of discrimination, harassment, or retaliation
immediately, so the concerns can be promptly investigated.
Any employee who is found to have violated any of these
policies may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and
including termination.
Suppliers

Please see the section on Supply Chain Management under
Management Criteria 1 for further detail. BlackRock9s
Supplier Code of Conduct & Ethics outlines the
expectations and standards of Suppliers that BlackRock
has established in relation to human rights, DEI,
environmental sustainability, and integrity, ethics, and anti-
corruption in management practices as well as
recommended best practices that it encourages its
Suppliers to adopt. As it relates to human rights and labor
standards, BlackRock expects the following from its
Suppliers:
Provide a safe and secure workplace for their
employees^20 that complies with all health and safety laws,
regulations, and practices. In addition, Suppliers are
expected to ensure that all employees are provided with
appropriate health and safety training, such as safe work
practices and emergency preparedness.
Fully comply with all applicable laws and regulations
when setting employee conditions on working hours,
benefits, and wages (such as minimum legal wages).
Fully comply with all applicable child labor laws and only
employ workers who meet the minimum legal age for that
jurisdiction. Where local laws are less stringent than the
International Labor Organization (<ILO=) minimum age
convention, BlackRock expects Suppliers to comply with
ILO standards.^21
Not to use any involuntary labor , such as slave, forced,
bonded, indentured, or prison labor, and not be involved in
any human trafficking or exploitation.
Manage their employees in a fair and ethical manner and
assure that all employees are treated with dignity and
respect. BlackRock expects its Suppliers to maintain a
workplace that is free from unlawful discrimination and
harassment in any form.

Philanthropy & Volunteering

BlackRock9s 2021 Sustainability Disclosure

Management Criteria 5

Description of monetary contributions, charitable gifts, and partnerships with organizations, as well
as community time contributions through volunteering in paid time
Social Impact

Social Impact, BlackRock9s philanthropic arm, works to

advance more sustainable economies and communities.

Social Impact has two distinct pillars:

The BlackRock Foundation (<The Foundation=), which
funds and partners with organizations globally that help
more people build financial security and participate in
the low-carbon transition.
BlackRock9s employee engagement programs, which
enable employees to drive local impact and address the
needs of our communities.
Through mission-aligned grantmaking from The

Foundation, disaster relief philanthropic commitments, and

employee engagement and volunteerism, BlackRock9s

Social Impact work strives to make a meaningful positive

impact on the communities where BlackRock operates.

Governance BlackRock9s philanthropic efforts are led by

BlackRock9s Social Impact team. The team is guided by an

internal Social Impact Board, comprised of senior global

executives, which provides oversight to the Social Impact

team to help align on annual strategies and budgets, and to

review and approve large grants and special initiatives.

Social Impact activity that is funded through The BlackRock

Foundation is overseen by The BlackRock Foundation9s

Board of Directors, which annually reviews and approves

The Foundation9s budget, as well as significant grants and

special initiatives. Finally, the Nominating, Governance and

Sustainability Committee of the BlackRock Board of

Directors annually reviews BlackRock9s philanthropic

programs and related policies and strategy.

Charitable Commitments
In 2021, Social Impact made progress on the firm9s ongoing
charitable commitments and made new commitments.
SDG 13 Breakthrough Energy Catalyst. In
September 2021, The Foundation made a
5 -year $100 million grant, its largest
philanthropic commitment to date, to
Breakthrough Energy Catalyst Foundation
(<Catalyst=), a program within the larger
Breakthrough Energy network. Catalyst
aims to accelerate the development of
clean energy technologies to achieve net-
zero emissions by 2050 and make these
solutions available and affordable across
the world. This philanthropic capital will
support efforts that reduce the <Green
Premium= across four critical
decarbonization technologies: clean
hydrogen; direct air capture; long-
duration energy storage; and sustainable
aviation fuel (<SAF=).
SDG 10 Job Upskilling Grants. In 2021,
BlackRock awarded over $6 million in
grants to non-profit partners in the US,
Canada, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico,
Peru, the UK, Germany, and India focused
on removing barriers to economic
opportunity and helping people access
higher paying, long-term employment.
BlackRock's non-profit partners include
Per Scholas, Laboratoria, Merit America,
CodeDoor, Technoserve, and RefuAid,
among others. These partners are working
around the world to provide training and
employment support that will put more
people on the path to sustainable
prosperity.
BlackRock9s 2021 Sustainability Disclosure 27

SDG 2 COVID-19 Relief and Recovery. In 2020,
BlackRock committed $50 million in
philanthropic funding to support COVID-
19 relief and recovery efforts globally. In
2021, BlackRock continued to channel
resources to meet ongoing needs in its
communities, while also pivoting its focus
to support a sustainable economic
recovery. To address persistent and
widespread food insecurity, BlackRock
donated over $2 million to local food
banks around the world. Additionally,
BlackRock deployed $1 million to two
India-based non-governmental
organizations (=NGO=) to provide medical
equipment and vital supplies as the
country faced a devastating second wave
of COVID-19. In 2021 BlackRock fulfilled
its 2020 commitment of $13 million to the
non-profit, Generation, and joined their
Global Recovery Coalition to help put
people back to work at scale, partnering
locally with Generation9s operations
across France, India, Italy, Spain, the UK,
and the US to help people access long-
term employment in high-growth sectors,
such as tech, healthcare, and green jobs.
Finally, the firm sponsored a $1 million
campaign with non-profit tech accelerator
FFWD, providing each BlackRock
employee with a $50 credit to donate to 1
of 14 tech non-profits innovating
solutions for COVID-19 recovery.
SDG 8 Employee Network Grants. In addition,
BlackRock9s Employee Networks
(<Networks=) are advocates, volunteers,
and supporters of important social issues
beyond the walls of the firm. To help
Networks stand up, speak out and
contribute to organizations doing
important work around their areas of
focus, Social Impact launched a $1 million
Network Grants program in partnership
with BlackRock9s DEI team in 2021.
BlackRock9s Networks nominate
organizations working regionally,
nationally, or globally for review by Social
Impact and DEI. The inaugural program
resulted in nine grants totalling nearly
$800K being given to organizations
nominated by five of BlackRock9s
Networks.
SDG 1 Emergency Savings Initiative.

BlackRock9s Emergency Savings Initiative
(<ESI=) was launched in 2019 to test,
innovate and scale solutions that make
short-term saving easier and more
accessible to low- to moderate-income
people in the US and UK. In 2021,
BlackRock renewed grants totalling $5.9
million to BlackRock9s three US-based
financial health expert non-profit
partners: Commonwealth, Financial
Health Network, and Common Cents Lab.
These non-profits are working with 30+
corporate partners, including employers,
payroll providers, record keepers, financial
institutions, and fin-techs, to expand
access to short-term savings products
reaching approximately 1 million people
in the US In 2021, BlackRock funded UK-
based non-profit partner, Nest Insight, to
launch a first-of-its-kind research trial to
automatically enroll workers into an
emergency savings plan.
Volunteering & Employee Charitable Contribution
Matching
In 2021, BlackRock launched a new Employee Network –
the Gives Network - to empower employees to channel their
shared passions to positively impact their communities.
The Gives Network builds upon BlackRock9s existing Gives
Grant program in which 24 employee-led Gives committees
located in offices around the world make grants to support
local nonprofit organizations nominated by employees in
their offices. In 2021, 325 grants totaling $4.1 million were
awarded to address community -centric needs such as
educational access and food insecurity.
In addition, BlackRock has a robust matching gifts program
that provides full-time employees with up to US $10,000 (or
local equivalent) per year in matched donations and
volunteer time. Benefits-eligible employees are also given
two paid volunteer days per year to volunteer. 37% of
employees either matched their gifts or their time in 2021,
collectively contributing $17.6 million, including matched
contributions by BlackRock, to charities around the world.
BlackRock activates 2:1 matching in response to natural
disasters and humanitarian crises. In 2021 disaster relief
campaigns addressing flooding in Western Europe and
Afghanistan humanitarian aid, among others, collectively
raised $1.2 million for charities providing immediate
support and long-term resilience to impacted communities.
BlackRock also offers a number of pro-bono volunteering
opportunities and board service programs where
employees can put their skills, expertise, and leadership
toward the pursuit of social innovation and change.

Natural Capital & Biodiversity

Natural Capital & Biodiversity

BlackRock9s 2021 Sustainability Disclosure

Management Criteria 6

Description of approach to incorporation of ecological impacts in investment processes and
strategies
As a financial services company, BlackRock9s physical

operations, which are located in cities around the globe,

generally do not have a material impact on ecosystems or

indigenous communities. Nonetheless, BlackRock makes

investments on behalf of clients in equities, bonds, and

alternative assets that may be subject to risks associated

with, or that arise from negative ecological impacts. As

different asset classes present different risks and

opportunities, BlackRock approaches these issues by

considering ecological impacts through its investment

stewardship function, its integration of ESG factors into

investment processes, its philanthropy efforts, and its

operations.

Investment Stewardship

A discussion of BlackRock9s approach to investment

stewardship is provided under FN-AC-410a.3. BIS engages

on material business risks and opportunities. For

companies whose business models have material

dependencies or impacts on natural capital, the

management of these factors can be a determinant of their

ability to generate sustainable, long-term financial returns

for shareholders, like BlackRock9s clients.^22 Natural capital

encompasses the supply of the world9s natural resources

from which economic value and benefits can be derived —

such as forests, oceans, and fresh water —and the

biodiversity that supports these ecosystems.^23 Given the

growing pressures on the natural ecosystems from which

many companies derive economic benefits, businesses will

increasingly face financial risks and opportunities

associated with their impacts and dependencies on natural

capital. As a result, BIS views the careful management of

natural capital as a core component of a resilient long-term

corporate strategy for companies that rely on the benefits

that nature provides.

While recognizing that natural capital is a complex issue

and ecosystems are interconnected, for the purposes of BIS9

work, the team focuses on three key areas —biodiversity,

deforestation, and water —which BIS believes can impact
the long-term financial returns of certain companies. BIS
looks to companies to disclose how they have adopted or
plan to incorporate business practices consistent with the
sustainable use and management of natural capital,
including resources such as clean air, water, land, minerals,
and forests. BIS is also interested to hear from companies
how they contribute to biodiversity and ecosystem health
and consider their broader impact on the communities in
which they operate. The following case studies illustrate
BIS9 engagement and voting related to natural capital
matters in 2021.
At Bunge Limited9s May 2021 AGM, BIS supported a
shareholder proposal requesting the company <issue a
report assessing if and how it could increase the scale,
pace, and rigor of its efforts to eliminate native vegetation
conversion in its soy supply chain.=^24 The company
recommended that shareholders support this proposal
and BIS agreed that the proposal may accelerate the
company9s progress on managing biodiversity loss and
deforestation in its operations and supply chain.
During 2021, BIS increasingly engaged on plastic
pollution. BIS believes company valuations can be
influenced by risks associated with a company not
adequately addressing the sourcing and use of plastic
products in their operations. At the Kroger Co. June 202 1
AGM, BIS supported a shareholder proposal requesting
that the company issue a report on its use of plastic
packaging, as well as the company9s strategies or goals
to reduce plastic packaging and impacts. While
acknowledging the efforts the company had made to
address its exposure to natural capital-related risks,
specifically in connection to the packaging of its <Our
Brands= products, BIS ultimately agreed with the
proposal9s intent to address the material business risk of
plastic packaging and determined that support for it
could accelerate the company9s progress on this issue.^25
ESG Integration & Risk Management

As part of BlackRock9s ESG integration approach for
actively managed strategies investing in the public
markets, BlackRock9s investment teams may consider
natural capital-related risks where financially material,
where data is available, and where relevant to the given
strategy and investment style. For example, one
component of BlackRock9s asset management business
where natural capital risks may arise in the course of ESG
integration is in BlackRock9s Alternative Investments
business (<BAI=). BAI takes a proactive approach to
identifying, analyzing, and documenting applicable ESG
factors –from initial deal sourcing and screening, through
detailed due diligence and investment committee review
and approval. Within the BAI Real Assets team, where
BlackRock invests in real estate and infrastructure on
behalf of clients, this may include a detailed review of
environmental factors, including those relating to
environmental protection, pollution prevention and the
conservation of local habitats and biodiversity.
Environmental risk assessments are undertaken for new
investments in real assets. Where appropriate, BAI partners
with specialist environmental and ecological consultants to
undertake such reviews. For greenfield projects, or those
comprising new construction and major development,
environmental considerations are factored into the design
process and project planning and are regularly monitored
throughout the duration of the construction activity.
Please see FN-AC-410a.2 for more information on ESG
integration.
Investment teams that have greater potential exposure to
ecological impacts consider these issues as part of their
research and portfolio management process. For example,
the BAI Real Assets team considers natural capital and risk
exposure during asset review and due diligence whereas
fundamental investors, who are reliant upon company
disclosures, are exploring a range of new data capabilities
to help identify potential risks. In public markets, portfolio
managers focused on exposure to natural-capital related
risks are testing new third-party data sets and tools to better
understand risk exposure, and where material may bring this
issue into engagement conversations with companies.
Partnerships & Philanthropy

BlackRock seeks to make positive contributions to its local
communities and to the planet by sponsoring and
participating in a variety of environmental conservation
efforts including:
Through a partnership driven by the firm9s employee-led
Green Team Network, BlackRock supports Earthwatch
Europe, an environmental charity, which plants <tiny
forests= in urban areas across the UK to help capture
carbon emissions, increase biodiversity, and contribute
to a more climate resilient society.
- BlackRock collaborates with organizations to bring
greater awareness and support action on climate and
natural capital-related efforts. BlackRock is also one of
the early signatories to the Terra Carta, unveiled at the
One Planet Summit in January 2021.
- BlackRock Social Impact efforts support a number of
environment-focused entrepreneurs through its
partnership with social entrepreneurship accelerator
Echoing Green. In 2021, BlackRock engaged in both
long-term (7-week) and short-term (90-minute) projects
where employees were paired with a climate-focused
Echoing Green Fellow to tackle a strategic challenge.
- Additionally, in September 2021 BlackRock became a
member of the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial
Disclosures (<TNFD=) with the goal of supporting the
initiative with global, cross-sector expertise. The TNFD
was launched to develop a framework for organizations
to report and act on evolving nature-related risks, and
build on the success of the Task Force on Climate-
related Financial Disclosures.
Corporate Operations

In its operations, BlackRock pursues a sustainability
strategy that seeks to decouple company growth from its
impact on the environment, while increasing the efficiency
and resiliency of its operations. BlackRock is finding
innovative ways to power its business with renewable
energy, lower its emissions, and reduce waste, among other
efforts, to reduce its environmental impact.
Through its global Green Team Network, BlackRock
employees have also augmented these efforts. Until the
COVID-19 pandemic prevented group volunteering,
employees globally were partnering with local nonprofits to
plant trees in a variety of areas, including those affected by
wildfires in California and Australia.
Additionally, BlackRock formalized an environmental policy
for BlackRock9s operations, outlining new standards that
are consistent with ISO 14001:2015 Environmental
Management System protocols in 2021. The policy defines
the roles and responsibilities of the firm, specific teams and
each employee plays in seeking to reduce the impact
BlackRock9s facilities and their operations have on the
environment.

Public Policy & Political Engagement

BlackRock believes that responsible corporate citizenship
requires active engagement in legislative and regulatory
processes. As part of its responsibilities to its shareholders
and clients, BlackRock advocates for public policies that
BlackRock believes are in its shareholders9 and clients9 long-
term best interests. BlackRock supports the creation of
regulatory regimes that increase financial market
transparency, protect investors, and facilitate responsible
growth of capital markets, while preserving consumer
choice and properly balancing benefits versus
implementation costs. BlackRock comments on public
policy topics through, among other things, its published
ViewPoints, which examine public policy issues and assess
their implications for investors, and through comment
letters and consultation responses that BlackRock submits
to policy makers. BlackRock believes in the value of open
dialogue and transparency on these important issues; its
position papers and letters are available on the <Insights –
Public Policy= section of its website.
Governance of Public Policy Engagement
BlackRock9s External Affairs group manages the firm9s key
reputational and policy challenges and opportunities.
BlackRock9s engagements with policy makers and advocacy
on public policy issues are coordinated by the Global Public
Policy Group (<GPPG=), a division of BlackRock9s External
Affairs group. Members of GPPG work closely with business
and legal teams to identify legislative and regulatory
priorities, both regionally and globally, that will protect
investors, increase shareholder value, and facilitate
responsible economic growth.
BlackRock9s Chief Legal Officer and Head of External Affairs
periodically brief BlackRock9s Board or its Committees to
keep directors apprised of, and engaged in, the Company9s
legislative and regulatory priorities and advocacy initiatives
Members of GPPG and executive leadership regularly meet.
and exchange views on legislation and regulatory priorities
with public officials and policy makers, regionally and
globally, and provide such individuals with educational
materials to help inform their decisions.
Political Participation
BlackRock9s ability to engage policy makers and participate
in the public policy arena is subject to extensive laws and
regulations at the international, federal, state, and local
levels. Under United States federal law, BlackRock may not
contribute corporate funds or make in-kind contributions to
candidates for federal office or to national party
committees. In addition to federal limits on corporate
political action, its political contributions at the state and
local level in the United States are governed by Municipal
Securities Rulemaking Board Rule G-37, SEC Rule 206(4)-5
of the Investment Advisors Act of 1940, and CFTC Rule
23.451, as well as applicable state and local law.
Accordingly, BlackRock does not contribute corporate funds
to candidates, political party committees, political action
committees (<PAC=), or any political organization exempt
from federal income taxes under Section 527 of the Internal
Revenue Code. Although permitted under federal law,
BlackRock has voluntarily elected not to spend corporate
funds directly on independent expenditures, including
electioneering communications. Information about
BlackRock9s lobbying activities, including contributions
required to be disclosed under the Lobbying Disclosure Act
of 1995, as amended, is publicly available on the Senate
website.
BlackRock maintains a political action committee that is
funded in accordance with applicable federal law on a
voluntary basis by employees of the Company who are US
citizens or green card holders. The PAC makes contributions
at the federal level on a bi-partisan basis consistent with the
Company9s contribution policies and public policy goals
and without regard to the private political preferences of
management. As required by law, all political contributions
by the PAC are reported to the Federal Election Commission
(<FEC=) and are publicly disclosed on the FEC website.
BlackRock also provides information on the PAC9s
contributions annually and information for 2021 can be
found on its Public Policy Engagement and Political
Activities Policies webpage.
In the third quarter of 2021, BlackRock implemented a
number of enhancements to strengthen governance,
improve transparency and encourage employee
engagement with eligible employees.
BlackRock maintains compliance processes designed to
ensure that its activities are conducted in accordance with
its Public Policy Engagement and Political Participation
Policies and all relevant laws governing political
contributions in the US. All employees are required to
annually review and acknowledge their compliance
responsibilities regarding political contributions and must
submit all of their proposed personal political contributions
to BlackRock9s Legal and Compliance Department to
determine if such contributions are consistent with
applicable legal restrictions.
Investment Stewardship9s perspective on corporate
political activities
A discussion of BlackRock9s approach to investment
stewardship is provided under FN-AC-410a.3. BIS engages
on financially material, business issues. In February 2022,
BIS updated its perspective on corporate political activities
and companies9 participation in industry and trade
associations. BIS regularly engages with companies to
understand how corporate political activities support policy
matters material to their long-term strategy and
shareholder value. As part of this, BIS looks at a company9s
publicly available disclosures to understand how lobbying
and political contributions support stated policy positions.
BIS also considers whether there is general consistency
between a company9s stated positions on policy matters
material to its strategy and the positions taken by
significant industry groups of which it is a member. As
investors, it helps our understanding when companies
provide easy to navigate information on their public
websites and disclose information related to their political
activities and lobbying.

Management Criteria 8

Disclose memberships in trade associations

As a part of BlackRock9s engagement in the public policy
process, BlackRock belongs to a number of trade
associations that advocate for and shape public policy
positions that are important to the asset management
industry and the global business community. Trade
associations also provide educational, training, and
professional networking opportunities for their members.
BlackRock participates in these associations for such
opportunities and to help build consensus on issues that it
believes will serve investors, increase shareholder value,
and facilitate responsible economic growth. BlackRock
does not control these organizations, and its membership
and participation in these organizations are not an
endorsement of their activities and positions. Accordingly,
there may be instances where specific positions diverge
from those of BlackRock.
The following is a list of the principal US trade associations
to which BlackRock belongs as well as those US trade
associations to which it paid in excess of $25,000 in 2021
for membership fees and/or dues.^26 This list has been
prepared in good faith and is for general information
purposes only. Variances in payment and fee schedules

Discussion of corporate positions related to government regulations and/or policy proposals that
address environmental and social factors affecting the industry
Public Policy Engagement on Sustainability

Issues

BlackRock advocates for public policies that BlackRock

believes are in its shareholders9 and clients9 long-term best

interests. BlackRock supports the creation of regulatory

regimes that increase financial market transparency,

protect investors, and facilitate responsible growth of

capital markets, while preserving consumer choice and

properly balancing benefits versus implementation costs.

Risks & Opportunities

ESG and sustainability have been the subject of increased

regulatory focus across jurisdictions. At the global level, the

International Financial Reporting Standards (<IFRS=)

Foundation established the International Sustainability

Standards Board (<ISSB=) in November 2021 to establish a

global baseline for sustainability-related disclosure

standards that may inform national regulators9 approaches

to sustainability disclosure regulation, and in March 2022,

the ISSB released two exposure drafts on climate-related

and general sustainability disclosure. In the US, the

Securities and Exchange Commission (<SEC=) has

proposed rules to require enhanced disclosure regarding

climate change and has publicly announced that it plans to

propose rules related to disclosure of human capital

management and board diversity for public issuers.^28 It has

also increased its scrutiny and compliance enforcement

related todisclosure of investment advisers9 and funds9

ESG strategies, and in May 2022, the SEC proposed (i)

amendments to its investment fund <Names Rule= that

would regulate the use of sustainability terminology in fund

naming and (ii) amendments related to ESG disclosure by

investment funds and investment advisers. In addition, the

US Department of Labor has proposed regulations that
could affect how ESG factors are considered for purposes of
investing assets of plans that are subject to the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, and
the exercise of voting rights with respect to plan
investments.
The European Union (<EU=) has introduced regulatory
proposals to underpin sustainable investment products;
require disclosure of sustainability -related information by
market participants, investment products, and issuers;
require integration of sustainability considerations into the
investment and risk management processes of asset
managers and other institutional investors; and make the
advice and financial product distribution process more
receptive to end-investor sustainability preferences. The
first set of rules initially took effect in March 2021, with
secondary rules to come over the course of 2022 and 2023.
In addition, requirements for asset managers to report
against an EU-wide taxonomy of environmentally
sustainable activities took effect at the start of 2022, with a
further phase expected in 2023, and new proposed
regulation to enhance sustainability reporting for EU-based
corporate issuers is expected to take effect in 2024.
Moreover, several European jurisdictions impose additional
restrictions around the offer of ESG funds through labeling,
disclosure, or marketing requirements at both the fund and
asset management level. In Asia, regulators in Singapore
and Hong Kong have introduced requirements for assets
mangers to integrate climate risk considerations in
investment and risk management processes, together with
enhanced disclosure and reporting, beginning in 2022.
Hong Kong has also issued enhanced rules for ESG funds
sold to retail investors and guidelines for pension trustees
on ESG risk management and disclosure.
BlackRock periodically reviews its memberships in these
trade associations, and the positions they support, to
evaluate whether there is alignment between BlackRock9s
views and those of these organizations on public policy
matters BlackRock considers material to its efforts to serve
its clients. Where BlackRock identifies a significant
inconsistency on a material strategic policy issue,
BlackRock will discuss and review its options with respect
to such organization, including review of the benefits and
challenges associated with its continued membership.
Actions that BlackRock may take to address material
misalignment include engagement with the trade
association, clarifying BlackRock9s position through public
statements, or consideration of the termination of its
membership in the trade association.
Additionally, BlackRock instructs these organizations^27 to
refrain from using any portion of the firm9s membership
dues or fees to influence the outcome of a federal, state or
local election, including using the firm9s membership dues
or fees to make contributions or expenditures in support of,
or opposition to, any candidate for any office, political party,
political committee, or other political organization exempt
from federal income taxes under Section 527 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
BlackRock9s 2021 Sustainability Disclosure 33

Policy Positions
BlackRock comments on public policy topics through its
ViewPoint and Policy Spotlight white papers, public
comment letters, and consultation responses that are
submitted to policy makers, among other mediums. Examples
of BlackRock9s positions on sustainability matters are
discussed below.
Climate-Related Disclosure
BlackRock supports efforts to implement requirements for
public issuers to provide investors with more comparable and
high-quality climate-related disclosures because this data is
necessary to help the firm9s clients effectively navigate the
global energy transition and achieve their objectives.
BlackRock offers principles for high quality climate-related
disclosures which it discusses in its paper titled <Spotlight:
BlackRock supports consistent climate-related disclosures;
urges global coordination=, which can be found under this
disclosure9s Additional Resources on page 40. The principles
outlined in the paper are applied in BlackRock9s response to
the SEC9s climate-related disclosure proposal and are
consistent with the views articulated in the firm9s June 2021
response to Commissioner Allison Herron Lee9s request for
input (<RFI=) on climate-related disclosure. BlackRock9s
response to the SEC9s climate related disclosure proposal can
be found in this disclosure9s Additional Resources on page 40
titled <SEC - The Enhancement and Standardization of
Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors.=
Sustainable Product Standards & Disclosures
BlackRock is supportive of efforts to provide end-investors
with more clarity regarding investment products9
sustainability characteristics and claims. Products that rely
on sustainability metrics to meet their investment
objectives or sustainability claims should provide
appropriate disclosure on those metrics to enable investors
to evaluate such claims.
BlackRock submitted a response to the International
Organization of Securities Commissions (<IOSCO=)
consultation on sustainability-related regulatory and
supervisory expectations in asset management following
the release of the consultation report, <Recommendations
on Sustainability-Related Practices, Policies Procedures
and Disclosure in Asset Management= on June 30, 2021. In
that response, BlackRock supported IOSCO9s endorsement
of asset managers disclosing how their investment
processes map on to the four pillars of the TCFD. It is
BlackRock9s view that mandatory corporate issuer
disclosure is an important first step to achieving consistent
and comparable product-level disclosure, and that a
sustainable product terminology framework is essential to
give investors a consistent and comparable understanding
of the various types of sustainable investing solutions
available to them.

Note 1: Basis of Presentation
The summary table below defines the criteria for each metric included in the BlackRock 2021 Sustainability Disclosure. The
criteria were established by referencing a variety of external frameworks, with a primary focus on SASB Standards. In a
number of instances, the topic areas identified through BlackRock9s stakeholder assessment were not covered by the SASB
Standard for Asset Management & Custody Activities, but were included in other SASB sector standards. As such, BlackRock
reviewed relevant SASB metrics for different sectors and adapted them to be relevant for the firm9s business. In addition,
criteria were informed by the UN Global Compact Communication of Progress advanced reporting criteria. Finally, where
necessary and applicable to a given topic area, BlackRock referenced additional sustainability disclosure frameworks.

INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANT’S REVIEWREPORT

BlackRock, Inc.
New York, NY

We have reviewed management of BlackRock, Inc.’s (<BlackRock=) assertion that the s pecified m etrics included
in the accompanying BlackRock’s 2021 Sustainability Disclosure as of, and for the year-ended December 31,
2021 (the <Disclosure=) are presented in accordance with the criteria s et forth in Note 1: Bas is of Presentation to

the Disclosure (the <criteria=). BlackRock’s management is responsible for its assertion. Our responsibility is to
expres s a conclusion on m anagement’s as sertion based on our review.

Our review was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Ins titute of

Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) in AT-C section 105, Concepts Common to All Attestation Engagements ,
and AT-C section 210, Review Engagements. Thos e s tandards require that we plan and perform the review to
obtain limited assurance about whether any material modifications should be made to management’s assertion
in order for it to be fairly stated. The procedures performed in a review vary in nature and timing from, and are
s ubs tantially les s in extent than an examination, the objective of which is to obtain reas onable assurance about
whether management’s assertion is fairly stated, in all material respects, in order to express an opinion.
Accordingly, we do not expres s s uch an opinion. Because of the lim ited nature of the engagement, the level of
assurance obtained in a review is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had an
exam ination been performed. We believe that the review evidence obtained is s ufficient and appropriate to
provides a reasonable basis for our conclusion.

We are required to be independent and to meet our ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code of

Professional Conduct is sued by the AICPA. We applied the Statem ents on Quality Control Standards
es tablished by the AICPA and, accordingly, maintain a comprehensive system of quality control.

The procedures we performed were based on our professional judgment. In perform ing our review, we

conducted inquiries and performed analytical procedures. For a selection of specified metrics, we performed
tes ts of mathematical accuracy of computations, read relevant policies to understand terms related to relevant
inform ation about the specified metrics, and reviewed supporting documentation in regard to the accuracy of
the data in the specified metrics.

The preparation of the s pecified metrics included in the Disclosure requires management to establish and
interpret the criteria, make determinations as to the relevancy of inform ation to be included, and m ake estimates
and assumptions that affect reported information. Measurements of certain metrics include estimates and

as s umptions that are s ubject to s ubstantial inherent m easurement uncertainty. Obtaining s ufficient, appropriate
review evidence to support our conclusion does not reduce the inherent uncertainty in the amounts and metrics.
The s election by m anagement of different but acceptable measurement methods, input data, or as s umptions
may have resulted in materially different amounts or metrics being reported.

Any inform ation relating to forward looking statements, goals and progress against goals, was not subject to
our review and, accordingly, we do not express a conclusion or any form of assurance on such information, as
denoted by an asterisk (*) in the Disclosure. Further, the information included within the Additional Resources

section of the Disclosure, including linked information, was not subject to our review and, accordingly, we do
not expres s a conclusion, opinion, or any form of assurance on such information.

Bas ed on our review, we are not aware of any m aterial modifications that s hould be m ade to m anagement of
BlackRock’s assertion that the specified metrics included in the accompanying Disclosure as of, and for the
year-ended December 31, 2021 are presented in accordance with the criteria s et forth in Note 1: Bas is of
Pres entation to the Dis closure, in order for it to be fairly s tated.

have included the Global Principles that are effective as of January 2022 in this Disclosure.
Total proposals voted include director -related proposals and shareholder proposals filed in Japan.
This metric excludes shareholders proposals filed in Japan, the global count of shareholder proposals excludes shareholder pr oposals voted in the Japanese market, where
numerous legally binding proposals are filed every year due to the low filing threshold. Japanese law allows proxy access for essentially any proposal and the threshold to file a legally
binding shareholder proposal is relatively low, at 1% of outstanding shares or 300 trading-units, held for over six months. By s eparating these proposals, we believe we can show a
better comparison of our voting activities on behalf of clients across markets.
The global aspiration is reflective of aggregated efforts; companies in developed and emerging markets are not equally equipped to transition their business and reduce emissions at
the same rate —those in developed markets with the largest market capitalization are better positioned to adapt their business models at an accelerated pace. Government policy
and regional targets may be reflective of these realities

Further information:
BMO established a Financial Crimes Unit (FCU) in 2019. The FCU ensures a coordinated approach to security across all functions and lines
of business, with intelligence-led horizontal collaboration and provisions for rapid recovery. The FCU strengthens our incident response
capabilities and integrates multiple layers of protection to safeguard our customers, our partners and our organization from current and
emerging security threats.
Approach to identifying vulnerabilities in information systems that pose a data security risk
BMO’s vulnerability identification and remediation process is implemented in alignment with industry standards, including the requirements
for information security certification under ISO 27001:2013, and is independently audited for compliance and operational effectiveness
on an annual basis. BMO conducts periodic vulnerability scans utilizing an industry-leading software solution. An independent partner
also carries out external penetration testing at least once a year. Identified vulnerabilities are verified, risk-rated, tracked, reported and
monitored for timely remediation.
BMO continues to invest in its technological infrastructure including a state-of-the-art security hub and a “follow the sun” operating model,
enabling teams to work globally across North America, Europe and Asia to detect, prevent, respond to and recover from security threats.
In addition, we are enhancing processes and improving BMO’s ability to prevent, detect and recover from cyber security threats, keeping
customers and employees safe.
BMO also works with various security and software suppliers to bolster internal resources and technology capabilities, with a goal to
respond to a rapidly evolving threat landscape.
Approach to addressing data security risks and vulnerabilities
BMO is committed to keeping its customer information secure while also providing highly professional and reliable business services. We
follow cyber security good practices and maintain an IT environment that integrates international standards and expectations. To address
the rapidly changing security threat landscape, we utilize resilient, agile technologies and makes significant investments in the continuous
improvement of BMO’s information security position.

Approach to addressing data security risks and vulnerabilities (continued)
BMO is also committed to building and maintaining a sound foundation by providing appropriate management support and instilling a
culture of security awareness across the organization. This involves:
- A three-lines-of-defence model for effective risk management and compliance monitoring.
- Appropriate segregation of duties, organizational structures, reporting lines, authorities and security responsibilities.
- A dedicated security risk governance function that applies risk metrics to monitor the current state of our operations and risk profile.
BMO continuously monitors and mitigates information security risks. This includes implementation of the following:
Policies and standards for information security and privacy.
Secure processes for the classification, handling and storage of information.
End-point protection and network security.
An annual mandatory security awareness learning program for all employees.
Frequent reporting to our executives, external regulators, and internal and external auditors.
Self-assessment against recognized frameworks and process benchmarking.
Trends observed in type, frequency and origination of attacks on data security and information systems
No single area is more vulnerable to attack than any other area. As BMO is a large enterprise with a significant technology and user
footprint, our infrastructure and employees may be targeted frequently by opportunistic attacks, and less frequently by targeted attacks.
Any such events are in line with the overall industry threat and risk profile.
Policies and procedures for disclosing incidents involving breaches of data security to customers
Depending on the nature of the breach, incidents involving suspected or actual breaches of data security or information systems must
be reported to either our Privacy Office or the Information Security team, which then manages the response to the incident, including
notifying BMO’s regulators and affected customers in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements.
Data and system security efforts related to new and emerging cyber threats and attack vectors
The BMO Financial Crimes Unit is responsible for managing all aspects of cyber security, information security, internal and external fraud,
crisis and continuity management, and physical security. The unit combines existing capabilities from across the enterprise in an integrated
central function, with a fusion centre model, which enhances both intelligence-gathering and response recovery.
A well-qualified Cyber Threat Intelligence and Analytics team is in place, which proactively monitors emerging threats that could impact
BMO’s employees, processes, technology and customers by gathering and analyzing threat information from various commercial, industry,
government, internal and open sources. The team also conducts threat hunting on a regular basis to identify potential malicious activity.
We continually enhance our cyber security controls in alignment with threat intelligence forecasts.
We continue to make additional investments in defensive technology, talent and processes in order to prevent, or detect and manage,
cyber security threats within BMO. These measures include benchmarking and review of best practices across the banking and cyber
security industries, evaluation of the effectiveness of our key controls and development of new controls as needed, with ongoing
investments in both technology and human resources.
In addition, senior management reviews BMO’s information security management system at regular intervals to ensure its ongoing
suitability, adequacy and effectiveness, and makes timely decisions for continuous improvement.
Degree to which BMO’s approach is aligned with external standards or frameworks and/or legal or regulatory frameworks for
managing data security
BMO is a highly regulated organization and undergoes many independent reviews on a periodic basis. BMO’s cyber security capabilities
are, based on our benchmarking, on par with our peers in the industry, align with the framework of the U.S. National Institute of Standards
and Technology (NIST), and meet the requirements of ISO 27001:2013 certification for information security. We have achieved the target
maturity level for all identified controls, and we continue to enhance our cyber security posture in alignment with cyber threat intelligence
forecasts. BMO was the first Canadian bank to obtain ISO 27001 certification for information security, and we have also been certified
(Tier IV) by Uptime Institute for our high-fault-tolerant data centre.

See page 55 of the Sustainability Report (Tracking our progress – Diversity, equity and inclusion).
Leadership accountability
Leadership accountability and advocacy are critical to success. At BMO, our leaders’ advocacy for diversity, equity and inclusion starts at
the top with CEO Darryl White, who is a vocal champion of inclusivity. On his first day as our CEO in November 2017, Mr. White signed on
as a Catalyst CEO Champion for Change and affirmed his commitment to “reviewing and improving the pipeline of women of diverse
backgrounds for advancement and empowering them with a strong support system.” He also signed the Catalyst Accord 2022, pledging to
work to increase the average percentage of women on boards and in executive positions in corporate Canada to 30% or higher by 2022.
Mr. White is Vice-Chair, Catalyst Canada Advisory Board, and has been a member of Catalyst’s global Board of Directors since March 2021. In
2020, Mr. White signed the BlackNorth CEO Pledge on behalf of BMO.
In 2012, we established the Leadership Committee for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (LCDEI) an enterprise-wide committee of more than
25 senior executives representing diversity at BMO, which oversees our progress toward achieving our diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI)
goals and advocates for inclusive practices for our colleagues, customers and communities. The committee is co-chaired by a member of
BMO’s Executive Committee who is appointed by the CEO. LCDEI establishes the strategic priorities that define our direction, along with a
number of specific action plans and ambitious workforce representation goals. A DEI update is presented to the Board of Directors on an
annual basis.
BMO’s DEI governance model is built on this leadership accountability and combines a leader-led approach with a grassroots approach,
spearheaded by more than 8,000 members of our 16 Enterprise Resource Groups (ERGs). Each ERG is sponsored by at least one senior
executive.
Representation goals
We set specific and ambitious goals across our organization by identifying gaps, removing barriers and then holding everyone – leaders
and managers – accountable for moving BMO forward. We know that what gets measured gets done, so diversity representation goals are
included in the annual performance objectives for the Group Head of each business. Since 2018, Diversity Dashboards have been included
in the materials prepared for Performance Committee meetings. In these quarterly meetings, chaired by the CEO, approximately 40 of
BMO’s most senior leaders discuss and report on critical business goals and results. The dashboard evolved in 2021 to incorporate an in-
depth qualitative overview of our progress on Zero Barriers to Inclusion for colleagues, customers and communities, as well as a quarterly
view of the representation of diverse employee groups in the workforce. The overview and assessment of the dashboard indicates how
diverse employee segments are represented to ensure that diversity remains a top priority and clarify accountability for our senior leaders.
In 2020, we announced new five-year diversity representation goals to address gaps affecting Black, Indigenous, People of Colour, Latinx
and 2SLGBTQ+ employees, customers and communities, and in 2021, began tracking our progress against these goals. Our Zero Barriers
to Inclusion 2025 representation goals involve an ambitious expansion of the multi-year diversity strategy we set out in 2017. New
benchmarks and plans for 2021 include doubling enterprise-wide representation for Black senior leaders, accelerating Indigenous inclusion
strategies, introducing a 2SLGBTQ+ representation goal, and maintaining a strong gender equity position.
Culture of inclusion
We make our leaders and employees aware of the value of inclusivity, and we share practical actions and behaviours for building an
inclusive environment in the workplace. For example, in 2016, we launched Learn from Difference (LFD), a multi-year initiative focused on
building inclusive leadership capabilities, equipping leaders with strategies to mitigate the effects of unconscious bias and establishing a
more inclusive environment for our colleagues, customers and communities. Phase one was centred on an introductory e-learning course
for managers on diversity and inclusion, and unconscious bias. Within three months, more than 80% of managers had completed the
course, and 97% of those managers felt confident in their ability to apply what they had learned in making everyday business decisions.
Building an inclusive workplace is a responsibility shared by everyone at BMO, so in 2019, we expanded the LFD program to all employees
and launched phase two, Learn from Difference for All (LFDA). In 2020, more than 80% of employees completed the new LFDA program,
and it is now included in all onboarding programs for new hires, helping to build a culture of inclusion and belonging for all. See page 55
of the Sustainability Report (Diversity, equity and inclusion).

In 2021, approximately 87% of Canadian employees completed the newly launched Indigenous Perspectives course, Nisitohtamowin
ᓂᓯᑐᐦᑕᒧᐃᐧᐣ, expanding awareness and cultural competency for all employees. In partnership with First Nations University of Canada and
Reconciliation Education, BMO made Nisitohtamowin available as a free public resource during National Indigenous History Month.
With over 20,000 site visits, this online course helped share knowledge and expand awareness during a critical time in Canada’s history.
The course is included in all onboarding programs for Canadian employees.
To ensure BMO employees, and in particular Black employees, were feeling supported during the period of heightened protests against
racial injustice in 2020, we launched a new internal website offering educational materials about racial injustice. It includes a guide
that provides background for understanding recent issues of racial injustice in the Black community, followed by a guide to support
conversations across BMO about race and what we can all do to make sure everyone is valued. In 2021, we launched a new internal
website, focused on programs and practices to support Black and Latinx inclusion at BMO. We continue to build on these initiatives with the
input of colleagues and ERG members enterprise-wide. In 2022, to expand awareness and inclusion, we plan to launch a newly designed
and customized course for all BMO employees, focusing on the experience of Black colleagues, customers and communities.
In 2021, BMO introduced guidance for managers to help them reduce unconscious bias in the year-end decision-making process, so that
they would be able to make more equitable performance and compensation decisions. As we build virtual offerings in response to the
COVID-19 pandemic, diversity, inclusion and inclusive leadership capability continues to be an important part of the leadership curriculum.
In 2020, our Zero Barriers to Inclusion 2025 strategy for colleagues, customers and communities led to a series of branch huddles focused
on cultural sensitivity. More than 8,000 branch employees and leaders participated across 900 branches in Canada.
Talent practices
Each year, as part of our Leadership Planning program, we identify employees with the potential to take on more senior roles in the
organization and we also prepare succession slates for key roles. Ensuring that BMO’s senior leadership team and leadership pipeline both
represent diversity is a focus of the Leadership Planning program.

BMO is developing a climate scenario analysis program to explore climate-specific vulnerabilities in order to enhance our resilience to
climate-related risks, in line with the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board’s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures
(TCFD). This program includes the evaluation of both physical and transition risks across a selection of climate-sensitive portfolios and we will
continue expanding analyses across sectors and risk types, in line with internal policies and any applicable regulatory requirements. Further

BMO Global Asset Management Responsible Investing Approach.
The following information pertains to BMO Global Asset Management (BMO GAM).
Approach to incorporation of ESG factors in investment processes and strategies
ESG integration is the consideration of financially material ESG issues in the course of investment analysis and decision-making in order to
gain a more comprehensive understanding of risk and long-term opportunity.
In integrating a consideration of ESG factors, BMO GAM tailors its approach for each specific investment strategy and asset class in order to
ensure that the resulting analyses are relevant and meaningful for each investment process. Elements of this approach include:
Screening: BMO GAM offers a range of screened funds for clients who wish to link investment performance to a clear set of ethical and
sustainability principles. To determine the eligibility of companies for investment under these strategies, we have developed stringent
criteria that are published on our website.
We review the criteria and indicators on a regular basis to ensure they reflect evolving responses to critical issues, emerging issues,
changes in regulation and other developments. Sustainability funds must meet a set of common criteria regarding minimum
sustainability performance and each fund publishes a separate investment policy outlining its specifications.
Thematic: BMO GAM offers a number of thematic investment solutions which seek to generate returns by investing in companies that
are working to meet specific sustainability challenges. These include the Women in Leadership Fund and the Sustainable Opportunities
Canadian Equity Fund.

Approach to incorporation of ESG factors in investment processes and strategies (continued)
Engagement: Our SDG Engagement Global Equity Fund has a mandate based on intensive engagement to improve the long-term
performance of investee companies and their contribution to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.
Integration: As a long-term investor, we seek to understand the fundamental factors shaping the risks and opportunities facing the
entities that issue the equity or debt we invest in. We believe that ESG factors can have a material impact on the performance of those
entities – and on the economy as a whole – and that a firm commitment to identifying and assessing the risks and opportunities arising
from ESG factors is an integral part of sound risk management. A consideration of ESG factors is incorporated into our investment
analyses across asset classes, and our tailored approach addresses each specific factor appropriately.
Approach to implementing ESG incorporation practices
Each of our investment teams identifies and integrates material ESG factors in its standard investment process, with the support of the
specialist Responsible Investment team. Fund managers and analysts have access to a wide range of ESG data and research – both third-
party and proprietary – which they use to systematically flag potentially material concerns that are then further analyzed to determine their
relevance to the investment case.
We continuously seek to strengthen the feedback loop that brings together the ESG information and experience our Responsible
Investment team has gained through active ownership activities (i.e., engagement and voting) with our main ESG databases and
decision-making processes. The Responsible Investment team conducts regular cross-team meetings and presentations on relevant
ESG issues, including thematic webinars; sharing active ownership data across platforms that are accessible to our investment teams;
encouraging analysts and portfolio managers to address ESG issues in their meetings with investee companies, or conducting
meetings jointly; and closely involving investment teams when exercising the right to vote at shareholders’ meetings and designing
engagement programs.
FN-AC-410a.3 Description of proxy voting and investee
engagement policies and procedures

See also Expectations of Social Practices Statement
See also Expectations of Environmental Practices Statement

Proxy voting approach
See Policies and procedures (above).
BMO GAM publishes all vote reports on our website, including the rationale for our voting decisions. We also regularly communicate
with investee companies on resolutions where our in-house team decided to vote against one or more of them, in order to alert those
companies to our decision and the rationale.
Investee engagement approach
Engagement is carried out by our Responsible Investment team, working in close partnership with our fund investment teams. Our process
is based on the following principles:
Prioritization: In order to identify targets or areas for engagement, the Responsible Investment team regularly monitors the
performance of investee companies in managing the ESG issues that present the greatest risks or opportunities in relation to long-term
investor value, as well as emerging governance and sustainability trends that could affect groups of companies within a sector or across
sectors. This monitoring and research activity significantly overlaps with the proprietary ESG monitoring systems we have developed to
support our ESG integration practices.

Investee engagement approach (continued)
Setting objectives: Setting specific engagement objectives and tracking results are both necessary in order to assess progress and
determine the next steps. Our Responsible Investment team takes the lead in developing objectives, but works in close consultation
and collaboration with our investment teams in order to ensure that our messages to investee companies are robust and consistent.
We strive to clearly communicate to those companies our engagement objectives and expectations, including an outline of what we
would consider to be a successful outcome.
Tracking results: We log and report activity in real time in an online engagement database. This information includes engagement
activity, method of engagement, company response and instances of change. We track the progress of our engagements (at issue level
for each company), and we itemize successful engagements and related milestones. Our engagement and milestone entries aim to
capture the context and materiality of our objectives and the impact of the progress made by the company.
Escalation: If we deem initial engagement efforts to be unsuccessful, we will consider escalation strategies, such as contacting a
company’s board, using proxy voting, filing a resolution, reducing our exposure or divesting our holdings.
Reporting: We report publicly on our active ownership activities on an annual basis in our Responsible Investment Review.
Our internal systems track the level at which engagement takes place. This may be at the board or senior executive level, or with operational

Description of approach to informing
customers about products and services
(continued)
BMO’s compensation and incentive plans are designed to encourage and reward performance aligned with appropriate behaviours.
BMO’s performance management process balances what our employees achieve with how they demonstrate our values. Sales force training
reinforces these expectations. In our compensation and incentive plans, employees are compensated based on sales revenue generated.
Sales revenue is generally recognized when a customer uses a product and may be reversed if a customer cancels or does not use a product.
Customers can raise and escalate concerns through defined processes. Regular monitoring of our sales force, along with audits and reviews
of our policies and procedures, ensures the continued integrity of our practices and processes. In 2018, the Human Resources Committee of
BMO’s Board of Directors reviewed retail incentive compensation plans in conjunction with the joint review of retail sales practices at six
Canadian banks conducted by the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada and OSFI.

In addition, BMO’s credit risk management framework incorporates governing principles that are defined in a series of corporate policies and
standards and apply to specific operating procedures. These are reviewed on a regular basis and modified when necessary to keep them
current and consistent with BMO’s risk appetite. The structure, limits (both notional and capital-based), collateral requirements, monitoring,
reporting and ongoing management of our credit exposures are all governed by these credit risk management principles.
Lending officers in the operating groups are responsible for recommending credit decisions based on the completion of appropriate due
diligence, and they assume accountability for the risks. With limited exceptions, credit officers in Enterprise Risk and Portfolio Management
approve all credit transactions and are accountable for providing an objective independent assessment of the lending recommendations and
risks assumed by the lending officers. All of these skilled and experienced individuals in the first and second lines of defence are subject to a
rigorous lending qualification process and operate in a disciplined environment with clear delegation of decision-making authority, including
individually-set lending limits, which are reviewed annually.

About SASB

The SASB Foundation was founded in 2011 as a not-for-profit, independent standards-setting organization. The

SASB Foundation’s mission is to establish and maintain industry-specific standards that assist companies in

disclosing financially material, decision-useful sustainability information to investors.

The SASB Foundation operates in a governance structure similar to the structure adopted by other

internationally recognized bodies that set standards for disclosure to investors, including the Financial

Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). This structure

includes a board of directors (“the Foundation Board”) and a standards-setting board (“the Standards Board” or

“the SASB”). The Standards Board develops, issues, and maintains the SASB standards. The Foundation Board

oversees the strategy, finances and operations of the entire organization, and appoints the members of the

Standards Board.

The Foundation Board is not involved in setting standards, but is responsible for overseeing the Standards

Board’s compliance with the organization’s due process requirements. As set out in the SASB Rules of

Procedure, the SASB’s standards-setting activities are transparent and follow careful due process, including

extensive consultation with companies, investors, and relevant experts.

BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS | COMMERCIAL BANKS INDUSTRY | 4

Introduction

The publication of the Sustainability Accounting Standard (“Standard”) for the Commercial Banks Industry marks an

important milestone for the industry and for global capital markets more generally. It is the first Standard designed to

assist companies in the Commercial Banks industry in disclosing financially material, decision-useful sustainability

information to investors.

The Commercial Banks Industry Standard was first released in a provisional form in June 2015 after an extensive

standard-setting process. Following the release of the Provisional Standard, the SASB staff, under the guidance of the

SASB standard-setting board (“the Standards Board” or “the SASB”), engaged in further due process to revise the

Standard. In October 2018, the Standards Board approved revisions to the Standard. The Standards Board

subsequently voted to approve the Commercial Banks Industry Standard, thereby including it in as one of the 77

industries for which the SASB has developed and published an industry standard.

The Basis for Conclusions describes the rationale for revisions made to the provisional industry standard. Additionally,

the document outlines the standard-setting process the Standards Board used to codify the standard. All standard-

setting documentation, including prior drafts of the standard, summary reports, and comment letters, which informed

the development of the standard, are publicly available at the Standard Setting Archive of the SASB website.

The Standards Board

The Standards Board is charged with developing, issuing, and maintaining SASB standards. The Standards Board

operates in accordance with its primary governance documents, including the SASB’s Conceptual Framework and

Rules of Procedure. The Conceptual Framework sets out the basic concepts, principles, definitions, and objectives that

guide the Standards Board in its approach to setting standards. The Rules of Procedure establishes the due process

followed by the Standards Board and staff in their standard-setting activities. The standard-setting process is designed

to ensure each industry standard reflects the core objectives established in the Conceptual Framework to facilitate

companies’ cost-effective reporting of financially material and decision-useful sustainability information to investors.

In its standard-setting role, the Standards Board operates in a transparent manner, including holding public board

meetings. The Standards Board currently uses a sector-based committee structure, with three Standards Board

members assigned primary responsibility for each given sector. In addition to sector committee reviews, the full

Standards Board evaluates revisions to the standards. Information on Standards Board meetings, including minutes,

agendas, and a schedule of upcoming meetings is available on the SASB website. A list of Standards Board members

and their respective sector committee assignments is included in Appendix A.

Development of the Sustainability Accounting Standards

SASB staff initiated its standard-setting activities in 2012 under the oversight of the Standards Council.^1 From August

2012 to March 2016, the SASB staff developed provisional standards for each of the industries identified in the

Sustainable Industry Classification System® (SICS®).^2 The provisional standards were developed through an iterative

(^1) The Standards Council served in a process oversight role, distinct from the standard-setting role the Standards Board serves in. Upon
completion of the provisional phase in 2016, the Standards Council was disbanded.
(^2) At the time of the development of the provisional standards, SICS® contained 79 industries. SICS® was subsequently revised to 77
industries as a result of the combining of industries that contained similar sustainability-related risk and opportunity characteristics.

BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS | COMMERCIAL BANKS INDUSTRY | 5

and transparent process centered on independent research, market input, and oversight from the Standards Council.

Each provisional industry standard was developed based on staff research, industry working group (“IWG”) feedback,

public comments, and individual consultations with companies, investors, and other relevant experts. Throughout the

development of the provisional standards, more than 2,800 individuals participated in IWGs, 172 public comment

letters were received, and hundreds of individual consultations were conducted with market participants by the SASB

staff.

In 2016, following the issuance of the provisional standards across all industries, the SASB staff initiated a dedicated

market consultation period to gain further insight into market views on the provisional standards. Subsequently, the

Standards Board was seated and initiated a due process phase that culminated in the codification of 77 industry

standards in October 2018. This standard-setting phase that began with the provisional standards and concluded with

the codified standards is described more fully below. All standard-setting documentation discussed below are publicly

available at the Standard Setting Archive of the SASB website.

 Consultation: In the six-month period from Q4 2016 – Q1 2017, the SASB staff conducted
consultations to gather additional input from companies, investors, and relevant experts on the
provisional standards. Throughout this phase, the SASB staff received input on the complete set of
industry standards from individual consultations conducted with 141 companies, 19 industry
associations, and 271 investor consultations via 38 institutional investors. The Consultation Summary
comprises the findings from the consultations.
 Technical Agenda: In July 2017, after a period of review to evaluate market input from consultations
on the provisional standards, the Standards Board worked with the SASB staff to publish the Technical
Agenda. The Technical Agenda formally lists the areas of focus to address in preparing the standards
for codification, emphasizing those issues for which strong evidence surfaced and/or those which
received significant market feedback during the consultation period.
 Public Comment Period: In October 2017, the Standards Board published exposure drafts of the
standards, which incorporated proposed changes guided by the Technical Agenda to the provisional
standards. This opened a 90-day period, subsequently extended to a 120-day period, from October
2017 to January 2018, for public comment and review of proposed changes to provisional standards.
Market participants provided 120 comment letters during the comment period. All letters received and
a Summary of Public Comments are available at the Standard Setting Archive.
The Standards Board and the SASB staff evaluated the public comments received in conjunction with previous market

input and research to determine the revisions to be made to the provisional standard.

Approval of the Industry Standard

On October 13, 2018, the Standards Board voted unanimously to revise the Provisional Standard for the Commercial

Banks industry. In light of these revisions, on October 16, 2018, the Standards Board voted unanimously in favor of

removing this Standard’s provisional status. In doing so, the Standards Board considered all phases of the standard-

setting process, including those detailed in the above documents, to assess their underlying rationale, their adherence

to due process, and their faithfulness to the essential concepts of sustainability accounting, as described in the

Conceptual Framework.

BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS | COMMERCIAL BANKS INDUSTRY | 6

The following section of this document describes the rationale for the revisions. Appendix B contains a redline table

that summarizes these revisions. Revisions relative to the provisional standard that have not altered the scope or

content of disclosure topics or metrics, such as those that are intended to improve the consistency, clarity, and

accuracy of the standard, are not specifically addressed in the Basis for Conclusions.

Future Updates to the Standards

As social, economic, regulatory, and other developments alter an industry’s competitive landscape, the SASB

standards may need to evolve to reflect new market dynamics. The Standards Board will follow a regular standards

review cycle to address emerging and evolving issues that may result in updates to the SASB standards.

The Standards Board intends to direct the SASB staff to compile and publish a Research Agenda , which outlines items

that have been identified as requiring further analysis. Evidence-based research and market input, including feedback

from outreach and consultation, will inform reviews of issues on the Research Agenda. Items from the Research

Agenda may later be added to the Standards Board’s Technical Agenda for additional due process and formal

deliberation. All updates are subject to the standard-setting process described in the Rules of Procedure.

BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS | COMMERCIAL BANKS INDUSTRY | 7

Revision FN-CB:01 – Industry: Commercial Banks; Topic

Name: Customer Privacy & Data Security

2017 Technical Agenda Item #2-4 Description

The SASB is evaluating revisions to the topic, including the corresponding metrics FN0101-06^3 and FN0101-07,^4 due

to its potential to affect corporate value, relevance across the industry, and level of investor interest.

Summary of Change – Revise Topic Name and Revise Metric

The SASB renamed the provisional disclosure topic from Customer Privacy & Data Security to Data Security, while

retaining existent metrics FN0101-06 “Number of data security breaches and percentage involving customers‘

personally identifiable information” (separately revised in the Revision FN-CB:02) and FN0101-07 “Discussion of

management approach to identifying and addressing vulnerabilities and threats to data security,” with minor changes

to the technical protocols to improve their internal alignment with other SASB standards.

Further, the SASB revised metric FN0101-07 from “Discussion of management approach to identifying and addressing

vulnerabilities and threats to data security” to “Description of approach to identifying and addressing data security

risks” and revised the associated technical protocol to include the alignment of company data security policies with

existing legal and regulatory frameworks related to data security in the scope of disclosure. The SASB additionally

revised the technical protocol to include a discussion of company policies related to the timeliness of the disclosure of

data breaches to affected parties.

Adherence to Criteria for Accounting Metrics

The Commercial Banks Industry Provisional Standard included a topic, Customer Privacy & Data Security, with

associated metrics that describe a company’s management of risks related to the storage and protection of its users’

sensitive data. The provisional metric FN0101-07 measured the level of robustness of commercial banks’ data security

efforts and specifically asked companies to discuss their policies and procedures for identifying vulnerabilities in their

information systems that pose a data security risk.

The SASB revised the metric to strengthen the requirements described in the technical protocol. Specifically, the

revised technical protocol includes a description of the degree to which a company’s management approaches are

aligned with external standards and/or legal or regul atory frameworks for managing data security. The updated

technical protocol references several regulatory frameworks applicable to the financial services companies as well as

those with broader applicability. The revised technical protocol further recommends the description of the regulatory

environment related to data security that a company operates in and whether data security policies and procedures

they adopted are the result of regulatory compliance or of voluntary industry best practice. The revision therefore

enhances the alignment of the metric with existing standards and regulatory frameworks.

Additionally, the SASB included guidance on the technical protocol to help companies describe policies and

procedures for disclosing the events of breaches to their customers in a timely manner. The disclosure ensures

completeness of information generated by the metric and its decision-usefulness to investors.

(^4) FN0101-07 – Discussion of management approach to identifying and addressing vulnerabilities and threats to data security

BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS | COMMERCIAL BANKS INDUSTRY | 8

Lastly, the revised technical protocol provides a more robust definition and scope of disclosure with respect to types of

cyber threats and attack vectors, which enhances comparability and completeness of the discussion generated by the

metric, thereby improving the consistency and comparability of associated company disclosures.

Supporting Analysis

The issue of customer privacy relates to the use of identifiable personal information for secondary purposes, internally

or externally, by sharing it with affiliates and/or non-affiliates. Research conducted after the release of the Provisional

Standards indicated that customer privacy is likely not material to companies in the Commercial Banks industry. This is

because the scope of commercial banking activities addressed by the SASB Standard includes issuing loans to and

accepting deposits from institutions and individuals. Customer privacy refers to the responsible use of customer data.

The SASB’s analysis, supported by feedback received from several large commercial banks, suggested that companies

involved in providing bank accounts and loans to customers do not use proprietary client information for secondary

marketing purposes. Therefore, few customer privacy risks are associated with commercial banking activities (as

opposed to, for example, credit and pre-paid debit card activities addressed by SASB’s Consumer Finance standard).

On the other hand, evidence suggests that data security may represent a material risk to the operations of commercial

banks. The industry ranks as one of the highest based on the average annualized cost of cybercrimes and abnormal

churn rates.^5

Companies in the industry allocate significant operating budgets to cybersecurity: “According to Homeland Security

Research’s ‘U.S. Financial Services: Cybersecurity Systems & Services Market’ report, the U.S. financial institution[s’]

cybersecurity market is the largest and fastest growing in the private sector, predicted to grow to $68 billion by 2020.

[Four of the largest integrated banks] spend a collective $1.5 billion on cybersecurity annually.”^6

The revised technical protocol of metric FN0101-07 provides a more robust definition and scope of disclosure with

respect to types of cyber threats and attack vectors which enhances comparability and completeness of the discussion

generated by the metric. The SASB analysis of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings shows that a

large number of financial services companies, including companies in the Commercial Banks industry, provide

discussion of types of cyber threats and attack vectors they do or may face.

Lastly, the SASB revised the technical protocol associated with the metric to include a discussion of companies'

cybersecurity frameworks. This discussion includes both company use of external standards or frameworks as well as

adherence to legal or regulatory requirements that companies in the industry may have to comply with. Specifically,

the relevant regulatory standards and frameworks in the financial services industries include:

 ISO/IEC 27001:2013—Information technology—Security techniques—Information security
management systems—Requirements

Market Input

Investors: All the investors who provided feedback on the topic indicated that customer privacy is unlikely to be

material and is currently not taken into consideration in their investment analysis of commercial banks.

Companies: Feedback from several large-cap companies operating in both the Consumer Finance and Commercial

Banks industries indicated that the topic was not relevant to the commercial banking segment. Companies stated that

the use of identifiable customer information for secondary purposes may present material risks only in the credit card

segment, which is addressed in the Consumer Finance industry.

Other: A subject matter expert suggested to clarify the scope of the technical protocol by including an additional

bullet related to any legal requirements associated with data security policies. The stakeholder further suggested to

revise the scope of the metric to include a discussion of the company’s policy regarding the timeliness of company

disclosure of data breaches to parties affected by the breach as well as quantitative data on timeliness of such

disclosure for stand-alone breaches.

Benefits

Improves the SASB Standard: The revised SASB Standard improves materiality of the information generated by the

standard by focusing only on relevant and applicable elements of disclosure.

Improves decision-usefulness: The change improves the completeness and alignment criteria of the metric by

providing greater context regarding the nature of data security policies employed by a company. Moreover, the

revision of the technical protocol associated with the qualitative metric improves the clarity of the standard while

maintaining the completeness of the set of disclosures associated with the topic. This enhances the decision-

usefulness of the information generated by the standard and helps investors better assess of the quality of a

company's management approach to identifying and addressing data security risks.

Revision FN-CB:02 – Industry: Commercial Banks; Topic

Name: Customer Privacy & Data Security

2017 Technical Agenda Item #2-5 Description

The SASB is evaluating the revision of metric FN0101-06^7 to ensure the relevance and decision-usefulness of the

metrics associated with the topic.

Summary of Change – Revise Metric

The SASB revised provisional metric FN0101-06 from “Number of data security breaches and percentage involving

customers’ personally identifiable information” to “(1) Number of data breaches, (2) percentage involving personally

identifiable information (PII), (3) number of account holders affected.”

Adherence to Criteria for Accounting Metrics

The Commercial Banks industry Provisional Standard includes a topic, Customer Privacy & Data Security^8 , with

associated metrics that describe a company’s management of risks related to the storage and protection of its users’

sensitive data. Provisional metric FN0101-06 was ambiguous in terms of what data are being asked for. Specifically,

the technical protocol of FN0101-06 did not satisfy two technical protocol attributes, measurability and completeness.

The revision eliminates ambiguity regarding what data are being asked for by clarifying that the number of unique

data breaches shall be disclosed, thereby improving the measurability and completeness of the metric. Furthermore,

the revised metric provides more useful information by including the number of account holders affected by such data

breaches—a critical element to understanding the magnitude of breaches. The revised metric benefits from being

more aligned with current corporate disclosures on the topic than the provisional metric. Additionally, the technical

protocol for the provisional metric did not provide a definition for the term “encryption,” which resulted in a narrow

scope of encrypted data breaches, unintentionally excluding critical information, and therefore, in the incomplete

disclosures. To improve the completeness of disclosures and alignment with existing terms defined by regulatory

agencies, the SASB revised the technical protocol to incorporate the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Careers and

Studies (NICCS) definition of “data breach” and “encryption,” and provided further reporting guidance on the scope

of disclosures involving encrypted data. This revision improves alignment between the SASB Standard and existing

regulatory reporting definitions, as well as the clarity for companies preparing the data, ultimately improving the cost-

effectiveness of the standard. Overall, the revised metric better accomplishes the core objectives of the standard by

clarifying that the number of unique incidents is to be disclosed, which improves the measurability and completeness

of the associated technical protocol, as well as the inclusion of the number of account holders affected by such

incidents, which improves the usefulness of the metric.

Supporting Analysis

The technical protocol associated with provisional metric FN0101-06 did not satisfy the measurability and

completeness attributes of a technical protocol, as it does not specify what is intended to be measured by “number of

data security breaches.” This may include number of unique instances of breaches, or it may include the number of

exposed customer records. For example, if a company faced two cyberattacks during the reporting period, with one

exposing 200,000 customer records, and another exposing 50,000 customer records, the provisional metric is unclear

(^7) FN0101-06 – Number of data security breaches and percentage involving customers‘ personally identifiable information

BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS | COMMERCIAL BANKS INDUSTRY | 11

as to whether the company would report this as “2” or “250,000.” Evidence shows that both the number of

incidents and the number of account holders affected are useful data points for understanding the frequency and

magnitude of data breaches.

Furthermore, an analysis of corporate disclosures demonstrates that, broadly speaking, this revised structure of

disclosure that includes the number of incidents and the number of customers affected is a best practice for corporate

disclosures. For example, after their own major breac hes, some of the largest publicly listed companies^9 in the

Financials and Technology & Communications sectors revealed, for the respective incidents, the number of accounts

affected. In greater detail, one company’s public disclosure after a data breach that came to light in 2016 provides an

illustrative example of the alignment of the revision with current corporate disclosures on the topic. In 2016, the

company disclosed an unauthorized data breach associated with more than one billion user accounts, the largest

known data breach to date. The firm’s disclosure distinguished between unique incidents and number of records

compromised, consistent with the revised metric.^10

Finally, the SASB revised the technical protocol of metric FN0101-06 to define the terms “data breach” and

“encryption” using definitions identified by NICCS, which is managed by the Cybersecurity Education and Awareness

Branch (CE&A) within the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Cybersecurity and Communications. The

NICCS is a part of the CE&A’s work to promote cybersecurity awareness, training, and education for the Nation’s

cybersecurity professionals.^11 The NICCS glossary of key cybersecurity terms is informed by ongoing feedback from

end users and stakeholders, and is often cited by the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission in documents such as the

Commission Statement and Guidance on Public Company Cybersecurity Disclosures.^12 The revision to align

cybersecurity terms with those of NICCS improves clarity by referencing governmental sources, enabling more

consistent and complete disclosures. Further, the revision likely improves cost-effectiveness of reporting for companies

by increasing uniformity across different reporting frameworks.

Additionally, when calculating the percent of data breaches in which account holders’ personally identifiable

information was breached, the technical protocol for the provisional metric included guidance on the scope of

disclosure as it relates to incidents whereby encrypted data is acquired with an encryption key. However, this language

failed to acknowledge instances through which weakly encrypted data is acquired without an encryption key but can

still be converted to plaintext. Thus, the SASB revised the technical protocol to provide additional reporting guidance

on the inclusion of incidents where there is reasonable belief that acquired encrypted data could be readily converted

to plaintext. The revision results in more complete disclosures by expanding the scope of disclosure to include

instances in which the attacker can recover the plaintext information.

BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS | COMMERCIAL BANKS INDUSTRY | 12

Market Input

Investors: Many investors across multiple industries and sectors consistently communicated during the SASB’s

consultation period that clarification of this metric was necessary—and there was strong agreement for the revised

metric. Investors have provided feedback that generally supports improvements to the clarity and completeness of the

standard, as well as alignment with widely-accepted terminology.

Companies: Multiple companies voiced confusion over the wording of the metric in the Provisional Standard and

communicated that it needed to be clarified in a manner similar to the revision. Feedback received by the SASB from a

company in another sector suggested redefining the te rm “data breach” to provide further reporting guidance and

eliminate subjectivity when disclosing associated metrics. Feedback also suggested providing a broader definition of

"encrypted data” to capture instances where there is reasonable belief that an attacker can recover the plaintext

information from the encrypted data.

Benefits

Improves the SASB Standard: The revision enhances the standardization of the metric by improving the measurability

and the completeness of the technical protocol. The revision also enhanced cost-effectiveness by aligning the SASB

Standard with existing regulatory reporting terms.

Improves decision-usefulness: The revision generates more useful information, given that both the number of unique

cybersecurity data breaches and the number of account holders affected are important elements needed to better

understand corporate performance on the topic.

Revision FN-CB:03 – Industry: Commercial Banks; Topic

Name: Financial Inclusion & Capacity Building

2017 Technical Agenda Item #2-1 Description

The SASB is evaluating the revision of metric FN0101-01^13 to ensure the relevance, decision-usefulness, and cost-

effectiveness of the metrics associated with the topic.

Summary of Change – Revise Metric

The SASB removed metric:

 FN0101-01 – Percentage of new accounts held by first-time account holders
and added metric:

 FN-CB-240a.3 – Number of no-cost retail checking accounts provided to previously unbanked or
underbanked customers
Note: Accounts that have contingencies such as the presence of a direct deposit and/or the minimum amount of

funds transferred to or from the account, have been excluded from disclosure as they are not relevant to the scope of

the topic.

Adherence to Criteria for Accounting Metrics

The Commercial Banks Industry Provisional Standard includes a topic on Financial Inclusion & Capacity Building with

five associated quantitative metrics to assess how banks balance their capacity building with risks associated with

lending to unbanked, underbanked, or underserved customers. Companies that fail to manage performance in this

area are likely to face challenges in expanding their product portfolios while minimizing portfolio exposure to non-

performing loans. This could result in higher cost of capital.

The provisional metric FN0101-01 included disclosure of the percentage of new accounts opened in a year that are

held by first-time account holders. In its provisional state, the metric did not directly address the risks associated with

the topic noted above. While there may be some correlation between first-time account holders and previously

unbanked/underbanked customers (as defined by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)), the former is a

broader measure that would encompass account holders who may not have been un- or underbanked. Thus, the

provisional metric’s scope was slightly broader than that of the topic.

While the provisional metric likely captured un- and underbanked individuals as a subset of the total numbers, the

figure was likely not sufficiently comparable and could be distorted by other factors, such as the age of account

holders (e.g., young individuals opening their first account with a bank after getting their first job) and not consistent

with the financial inclusion rationale of the disclosure topic. The revision to a more focused measure of financial

inclusion improves the comparability and representativeness of the information disclosed.

(^13) FN0101-01 – Percentage of new accounts held by first-time account holders

BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS | COMMERCIAL BANKS INDUSTRY | 14

Supporting Analysis

Disclosure analysis has not revealed existent disclosure of the first-time account holders from banks. At the same time,

number of no-cost accounts is a metric often reported in SEC filings by many U.S.-listed public banks. One publicly

listed savings and loan holding company states in its in its 8-K, “... no- and low-cost checking deposit accounts

represent 47 percent of total customer deposits at March 31, 2017.” Several other banks state that no-cost checking

accounts are one of the services they provide. On conference calls, several commercial banks highlight no-cost

accounts as one of their offerings that enable them to grow their customer base. In its sell-side reports, a large

integrated bank mentions no-cost checking accounts as one of the factors helping large commercial banks drive their

cost of funds down. Therefore, narrowing the scope of the metric improves its representativeness, as it is less likely to

be distorted by individuals opening first-time accounts that may not be considered un- or underbanked (for example,

children of individuals with adequate access to banking services). The narrower scope also improves comparability by

diminishing the margin for the metric to be distorted by differing strategies on unrelated issues (for example, targeting

children of current accountholders as potential new customers).

Market Input

Investors: None of the investors who provided feedback on provisional metric FN0101-01 found it decision-useful, and

all suggested dropping it. The new metric on number and value of no-cost accounts was suggested by investors as

decision-useful and commonly considered for the financial inclusion topic by financial analysts. The SASB further

received feedback from multiple investors indicating the decision-usefulness of the metric if provided with appropriate

technical guidance highlighting the focus on financial inclusion.

Companies: Several large U.S.-listed commercial banks stated that the provisional metric was not a fair representation

of performance on the disclosure topic. On the other hand, company feedback confirmed that no-cost accounts are

commonly used to measure access to finance. Companies stated that such metrics are disclosed by many companies

in various SEC filings and ESG reports.

Benefits

Improves the SASB Standard: The revised metric improves the quality of the information generated by the standard by

offering investors a more representative view of company performance on the topic.

Improves cost-effectiveness : The new metric is currently measured and reported by some companies. Alignment with

existent disclosure improves cost-effectiveness of the standard, allowing companies to collect and report data through

existent channels.

Improves decision-usefulness: Feedback from investors suggests that the revised metric is a direct measure of financial

inclusion, as no-cost accounts provide decision-useful information on companies’ management of the level of access

to their services.

Revision FN-CB:04 – Industry: Commercial Banks; Topic

Name: Financial Inclusion & Capacity Building

2017 Technical Agenda Item #2-2 Description

The SASB is evaluating the revision of metrics FN0101-02^14 and FN0101-04^15 to ensure the alignment, decision-

usefulness, and cost-effectiveness of the metrics associated with the topic.

Summary of Change – Revise Metrics

The SASB removed metrics:

 FN0101-02 – Percentage of total domestic loans for underserved and underbanked business segments
 FN0101-04 – Loan-to-deposit ratio for: (1) Overall domestic lending (2) Underserved and underbanked
business segments
The SASB replaced them with metric:

 FN-CB-240a.1 – (1) Number and (2) amount of loans outstanding qualified to programs designed to
promote small business and community development
Adherence to Criteria for Accounting Metrics

The Commercial Banks Industry Provisional Standard includes a topic Financial Inclusion & Capacity Building with

associated metrics to describe how commercial banks enhance shareholder value through efforts to expand inclusion

and build capacity through financial literacy initiatives as well as building a loan portfolio focused on community

development. The revised metric is intended to measure the size of lending focused on financial inclusion and

community development. The revised metric replaces two provisional metrics FN0101-02 and FN0101-04. While both

provisional metrics were relevant, the revision improves several criteria for metric selection from the SASB Conceptual

Framework to improve the decision-usefulness of information provided to investors. The technical protocol of the

provisional metric FN0101-02 did not appropriately define the scope, as it groups overlapping loan categories that

would prevent the data being reported in a format that is useful and/or verifiable. The SASB has additionally revised

the metrics to clarify references to “underserved” and “underbanked” customers in the provisional metrics with

clearly defined regulatory programs aimed to incentivize financial inclusion. Referencing these regulatory frameworks

as the basis for computation of the new metric improves their alignment with existing reporting requirements.

Further, the revision from ratios to absolute numbers and value of loans improves usefulness of the metric as

individual underlying elements of ratio calculation, which will be more decision-useful to analyze. Activity metrics

and/or data reported by companies in their financial filings would allow analysts to calculate ratios.

Supporting Analysis

The loan-to-deposit ratio for an overall portfolio can be currently derived from data reported on a commercial bank’s

GAAP financial statements. When combined with currently reported GAAP metrics, the revised metric allows investors

to calculate relevant ratios to understand company performance on the topic. Therefore, the SASB revised the

(^14) FN0101-02 – Percentage of total domestic loans for underserved and underbanked business segments
(^15) FN0101-04 – Loan-to-deposit ratio for: (1) Overall domestic lending (2) Underserved and underbanked business segments

BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS | COMMERCIAL BANKS INDUSTRY | 16

standard to measure the number and value of applicable loans, which improves the usefulness of the metric and its

relevance to the financial inclusion issue.

The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), which is a U.S. federal law enacted by the Congress in 1977 and enforced

by the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the

Currency (OCC), and the Office of Thrift Supervision, states that “regulated financial institutions have continuing and

affirmative obligations to help meet the credit needs of the local communities in which they are chartered.” Banks

mention these requirements in their filings with the SEC. Institutions with at least $1.2 billion in assets must collect

and report data associated with CRA compliance. Data from Bloomberg Professional Services show that 95 percent of

publicly listed companies in the industry are subject to the reporting requirements associated with the CRA. Analysis

of SEC filings shows that more than 20 publicly listed large- and mid-cap commercial banks discuss the CRA and

community lending in their annual reports.

The revision addresses multiple criteria for accounting metrics as outlined in the SASB Conceptual Framework.

First, the revised metric is closely aligned with the requirements of the CRA and covers most companies. Second,

the revised metric aligns both the scope of reporting and calculation methodology with the framework, which

improves comparability and verifiability of reported data.

Performance on the revised metric has a direct link to financial performance. For example, resultant disclosures

could allow analysts to measure revenue growth opportunities from expanding into underserved communities.

The metric would further be an indicator of regulatory compliance, as the vast majority of banks are subject to

satisfying CRA performance requirements. Noncompliance with the CRA would prevent banks from expanding

their operations. Therefore, the data generated by th e revise SASB metric would be more useful to both

companies and investors.

Market Input

Investors: Feedback from investors indicated that the number and value of deposits is unlikely to be a relevant

measure of performance of financial inclusion and therefore unlikely to be decision-useful for financial analysis.

Multiple investors that provided feedback on this topic stated that when they analyze companies’ management of

financial inclusion in the Commercial Banks industry they focus on lending practices and specifically the amount of

CRA-qualified lending.

Companies: Companies unanimously suggested changing the terminology from lending to “underserved” and

“underbanked” consumers to lending as measured by categories recognized by the CRA. Company feedback

indicated that the change would significantly improve cost-effectiveness of reporting because companies already

collect this data per existing regulatory requirements.

Benefits

Improves the SASB Standard: The revision improves materiality of the information generated by the standard, as the

new metric is focused on the most relevant aspect of the topic, which is lending practices that promote financial

inclusion.

Improves cost-effectiveness: SASB analysis of SEC filings suggests that the vast majority of commercial banks currently

state in their SEC filings that they are required to collect and report the amount of originated CRA-qualified loans to

BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS | COMMERCIAL BANKS INDUSTRY | 17

regulators. Therefore, the change aligns the disclosure with an existing regulatory framework and allows companies to

utilize existing channels for collection and reporting of this data.

Improves decision-usefulness: Performance on the revised metric (both an absolute value and the change over time)

can be converted to the financial performance of a commercial bank. The updated metric provides decision-useful

information in that it measures the magnitude of performance and financial impact through the number and value of

loans and highlights the level of compliance with evolving CRA requirements.

Revision FN-CB:05 – Industry: Commercial Banks; Topic

Name: Financial Inclusion & Capacity Building

2017 Technical Agenda Item #2-3 Description

The SASB is evaluating the revision of metric FN0101-05^16 to ensure the alignment, decision-usefulness, and cost-

effectiveness of the metrics associated with the topic.

Summary of Change – Revise Metric

The SASB has removed metric:

 FN0101-05 – Loan default rates for: (1) Overall domestic lending (2) Underserved and underbanked
business segments
The SASB has replaced it with metric:

 FN-CB-240a.2 – (1) Number and (2) amount of past due and nonaccrual loans qualified to programs
designed to promote small business and community development
Adherence to Criteria for Accounting Metrics

The Commercial Banks Industry Provisional Standard includes the topic Financial Inclusion & Capacity Building with

associated metrics to describe how commercial banks enhance shareholder value through efforts to expand inclusion

and build capacity through financial literacy initiatives and building loan portfolios focused on community

development. The revised metric is intended to measure the performance of loans focused on financial inclusion and

community development by indicating the number and amount of loans past due and on nonaccrual. The metric is

also meant to be an indicator of origination practices, specifically aggressive and predatory lending practices.

Combined with the metric added in Revision FN-CB:04, the revision provides a complete picture of a company’s

community development strategy.

The revised metric replaces the provisional metric FN0101-05. While the provisional metric was relevant, the revision

improves several criteria for metric selection from the SASB Conceptual Framework to improve decision-usefulness of

information provided to investors. The technical protocol of the provisional metric FN0101-05 used insufficiently clear

definitions of “underserved” and “underbanked” customers. The SASB updated the technical protocol with

references to regulatory programs that aim to incentivize financial inclusion. Referencing these regulatory frameworks

as the basis for computation of the revised metric will improve its alignment with existing reporting requirements.

Further, the SASB replaced the potentially subjective term of “default rates” and the calculation provided by the SASB

with terms and instructions included in the Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income (Call Reports). The change

improves verifiability and comparability of the metric.

Supporting Analysis

The data associated with the existing, provisional metric FN0101-05 —including overall default rates—can be

calculated from data reported on financial statements and are not relevant to the topic of Financial Inclusion &

(^16) FN0101-05 – Loan default rates for: (1) Overall domestic lending (2) Underserved and underbanked business segments

BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS | COMMERCIAL BANKS INDUSTRY | 19

Capacity Building. By focusing the revised metric on performance on loans qualified to programs designed to promote

small business and community development, the revised standard will generate information that is more relevant to

company performance on the Financial Inclusion & Capacity Building topic.

The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) states that, “regulated financial institutions have continuing and

affirmative obligations to help meet the credit needs of the local communities in which they are chartered.”

Banks mention these requirements in their filings with the SEC. Institutions with at least $1.2 billion in assets must

collect and report data associated with CRA compliance. Data from Bloomberg Professional Services shows that

over 95 percent of publicly listed companies in the industry are subject to the reporting requirements associated

with the CRA. Analysis of SEC filings shows that more than 20 publicly listed large- and mid-cap commercial

banks discuss the CRA and community lending in their annual reports. In addition, the revised metric aligns both

the scope of reporting and the calculation methodology with the framework, which improves comparability and

verifiability of reported data.

Performance on the revised metric has both direct and indirect links to financial performance. Directly, it measures

the amount of expected revenue lost due to customers missing loan payments. Indirectly, it could be a forward-

looking indicator of risks associated with compliance with the CRA as well as the ability for banks to expand their

community development portfolios. Holistically, it would allow analysts to measure the quality of loan origination

focused on community development. Therefore, the data generated by the revised SASB metric would be more

useful to both companies and investors.

Market Input

Investors: The metric was found to be a decision-useful measure of performance by investors involved in consultation.

Companies: The SASB did not receive specific comments on the revision to metric FN0101-05 from companies,

including feedback related to appropriate measures of loan performance. However, the SASB did receive feedback

related to Revision FN-CB:04, which also relates to the present revision, insofar as the present revision is logically

consistent with the changes implemented in FN-CB:04 and the associated improvements to the standard.

Benefits

Improves the SASB Standard : The provisional metric asked for the default rate of the overall lending portfolio, which

was not a relevant indicator for the disclosure topic. The revised metric better measures performance of only a subset

of loans that are relevant to financial inclusion and capacity building of banks.

Improves alignment: The change aligns the format of the default rates metric with the format in which loans qualified

to programs designed to promote financial inclusion are to be reported. The technical protocol of the revised metric is

aligned with that of the metric discussed in Revision FN-CB:04, which allows a direct assessment of the quality of loan

origination covered in Revision FN-CB:04.

Improves decision-usefulness: The metric improves decision-usefulness of disclosed information on the metric

discussed in Revision FN-CB:04 (Number and amount of loans outstanding qualified to programs designed to promote

small-business and community development). It additionally allows analysts to assess the quality of loans originated

and determine whether long-term sustainability of business was taken into account at origination or whether

aggressive lending practices were employed to boost short-term interest income.

Revision FN-CB:06 – Industry: Commercial Banks; Topic

Name: Integration of Environmental, Social, and Governance

Risk Factors in Credit Risk Analysis

2017 Technical Agenda Item #2-10 Description

The SASB is evaluating the removal of metric FN0101-17^17 to ensure the relevance and cost-effectiveness of the

metrics associated with the topic.

Summary of Change – Remove Metric

The SASB removed provisional metric FN0101-17, “Amount and percentage of lending and project finance that

employs: (1) Integration of ESG factors (2) Sustainability themed lending or finance (3) Screening (exclusionary,

inclusionary, or benchmarked) (4) Impact or community lending or finance.”

Adherence to Criteria for Accounting Metrics

The Commercial Banks Industry Provisional Standard included a topic, Integration of Environmental, Social, and

Governance Risk Factors in Credit Risk Analysis^18 , with associated metrics that described a company’s understanding

and management of its exposure to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) risks and opportunities in its loan

portfolio. Specifically, the topic and associated metrics were intended to help analysts assess a company’s approach to

integrating ESG factors in credit risk analysis of borrowers at the stage of loan origination and servicing. Provisional

metrics FN0101-15 and FN0101-16 captured a company’s approach to ESG integration and management’s view of

the company’s ESG exposure. In addition to these qualitative provisional metrics, the metric revision described in

Revision FN-CB:07 provides a quantitative measure of ESG exposure by industry. The SASB removed metric FN0101-

17, as it is unlikely to provide additional marginal value over the other metrics included in the topic. The provisional

metric FN0101-17 quantitatively measured the scope of ESG integration through various strategies such as screening,

sustainability-themed lending, or impact and community investing. For these reasons, removal of the provisional

metric FN0101-17 improves the applicability of the set of metrics associated with the topic, as well as their ability to

present a fair representation of performance on the topic. Further, removal of the provisional metric does not impair

the completeness of the metrics set retained in the disclosure topic. Metrics included in the topic provide complete

information on a company’s performance to investors.

Supporting Analysis

Research and feedback from companies and investors suggest that certain elements of metric FN0101-17 are not

applicable to commercial banking activities. Specifically, sustainability-themed lending and finance are traditionally

included in the investing and lending business segment covered in the Investment Banking & Brokerage industry.

Furthermore, community lending and finance are covered in the Financial Inclusion & Capacity Building disclosure

topic.

Market Input

Investors: Subject matter experts and analysts noted overlap between the provisional metric and the Financial Inclusion

& Capacity Building topic, which also addresses impact and community lending and finance. Their feedback further

suggested that sustainability-themed lending and finance are more relevant to the investment and lending business

segment, which falls under the Investment Banking & Brokerage industry’s activities. No investors providing feedback

on the topic found provisional metric FN0101-17 to be relevant or decision-useful for commercial banks.

Companies: Companies agreed that focusing on a holistic integration of ESG risks in credit risk analysis rather than on

various subgroups—such as sustainability-themed lending, screening, and other ESG-marketed portfolios—would

“push the envelope” of ESG integration in the right direction. Companies further agreed that disclosure topics

focused on financial inclusion in the Commercial Banks industry and ESG integration in the Investment Banking &

Brokerage industry unnecessarily overlapped with the metric, and they therefore suggested removing it from this

topic.

Benefits

Improves the SASB Standard: The provisional metric was not found to be decision-useful by companies or investors. As

such, the revision to remove the metric improves the applicability of the set of metrics associated with the topic, as

well as their ability to present a fair representation of performance on the topic.

Improves cost-effectiveness: By removing the provisional metric, the revision improves the cost-effectiveness of

disclosure on the topic.

Revision FN-CB:07 – Industry: Commercial Banks; Topic

Name: Integration of Environmental, Social, and Governance

Risk Factors in Credit Risk Analysis

2017 Technical Agenda Item #2-11 Description

The SASB is evaluating the revision of metric FN0101-18^19 to ensure the relevance and decision-usefulness of the

metrics associated with the topic.

Summary of Change – Revise Metric

The SASB revised provisional metric FN0101-18 from “Total loans to companies in the following sectors/industries:

Energy/Oil & Gas, Materials/Basic Materials, Industrials, and Utilities” to “Commercial and industrial credit exposure,

by industry.”

Adherence to Criteria for Accounting Metrics

The Commercial Banks Industry Provisional Standard included a topic, Integration of Environmental, Social, and

Governance Risk Factors in Credit Risk Analysis^20 , with four associated metrics to describe a company’s understanding

and management of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) risks and opportunities in its loan portfolio.

Specifically, the topic and associated metrics were intended to help analysts assess the company’s approach to

integrating ESG risks in credit risk analysis of borrowers at the stage of loan origination and servicing. Provisional

qualitative metrics FN0101-15 and FN0101-16 captured the extent of a company’s ESG integration practices and the

level of its understanding of ESG exposure. The provisional metric FN0101-17 was removed (please refer to Revision

FN-CB:06). The provisional metric FN0101-18 measured a bank’s exposure to the most carbon-intensive industries,

which therefore highlights concentration of climate-related risk on the loan portfolio. The SASB revised this metric, as

exposure to carbon is only one aspect of climate-related risk and climate risk is just one of many ESG factors to which

borrowers may be exposed. Therefore, in accordance with the criteria for accounting metrics set forth in the SASB

Conceptual Framework , the revision enhances the completeness and neutrality of the information yielded by the set of

metrics associated with this topic.

To improve verifiability and comparability of the provisional metric, the SASB provides a reference to a well-recognized

classification system that would be used to classify borrowers. Additionally, the revision improves usefulness of the

metric by providing a holistic view on ESG risk exposure of borrowers.

Supporting Analysis

In researching and developing sustainability accounting standards for 79 industries, the SASB identified various

sustainability issues that are reasonably likely to materially impact the financial condition and operations of companies

in each industry of the economy. These sustainability (or ESG) factors range from environmental to human and social

capital and beyond, and can impact the risk profile of companies. Companies transfer some of these risks to banks

from which they obtain loans, which means that commercial and industrial loan portfolios of commercial banks are

Utilities

Factors in Credit Risk Analysis to Incorporation of Environmental, Social, and Governance Factors in Credit Analysis.

BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS | COMMERCIAL BANKS INDUSTRY | 23

likely to be exposed to a wide range of environmental and social risks. Therefore, when making lending decisions, it is

important for banks to understand and manage the universe of ESG risks and opportunities to which borrowers may

be exposed.

Analysis of corporate disclosures shows that many of the largest companies in the industry, including three of the ten

largest integrated banks, report their corporate credit portfolio by industry or sector in Form 10-K. Such information is

useful in assessing portfolio exposure to financial and economic risk factors. Combined with the other metrics related

to this topic, the industry exposure metric would further yield information useful to assessing the ESG exposure of

borrowers.

However, current disclosure of portfolio exposure by industry is not standardized. For example, companies do not

disclose the systems used to classify borrowers into one industry versus another. Companies may also report their

exposure at various levels (e.g., sector versus industry versus sub-industry), further hindering comparability. To address

this issue, the SASB references a well-recognized classification system, the North American Industry Classification

System (NAICS), in the guidance for the revised metric. The disclosure is required to be provided at the NAICS

Subsector level. This approach improves the verifiability and comparability of the SASB metric.

Market Input

Investors: Investors generally recommended that metrics for this topic reflect a more holistic approach to ESG

integration rather than a focus on specific risks (e.g., climate). All analysts that provided feedback on this metric found

it helpful and would like to see companies report credit portfolio exposure in a standardized manner. Along with

qualitative discussion of ESG risks and strategies companies employ to account for the risks when they issue loans to

borrowers, this metric provides them with a holistic picture of ESG credit risk on banks’ books.

Companies: Several large-cap companies stated that providing a breakdown by industry rather than explicitly asking

for exposure to energy-related industries is more appropriate. Otherwise, the SASB would be making a judgment as to

what industries are exposed to more ESG risks. Companies stated that banks do track borrower industry exposure at

originations that would not create a significant cost in collecting and reporting the data. During the SASB’s

consultation period, companies confirmed that there is a lack of comparability and recommended that the SASB

identify a well-recognized classification system to be referenced in the technical protocol. Companies also stated that

the banking industry as a whole, as well as investors, would benefit from a standardized approach to reporting on

ESG integration in credit risk analysis.

Benefits

Improves the SASB Standard: The revision improves the standard by shifting its focus from only a subset of ESG risks

to a more holistic approach to analyzing credit risks associated with sustainability factors. The proposal addresses

completeness, neutrality, and usefulness of SASB metrics.

Improves decision-usefulness: As highlighted by the feedback received from investors, the overall industry-level

exposure provides information that is more decision-useful and allows for a more holistic investment analysis

compared to the provisional metric, which only measures exposure to a small subset of industries and related ESG

risks.

Revision FN-CB:08 – Industry: Commercial Banks; Topic

Name: Integration of Environmental, Social, and Governance

Risk Factors in Credit Risk Analysis

Summary of Change – Revise Metrics

The SASB removed metrics:

 FN0101-15 – Discussion of how environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors are integrated
into the lending process
 FN0101-16 – Discussion of credit risk to the loan portfolio presented by climate change, natural
resource constraints, human rights concerns, or other broad sustainability trends
The SASB replaced them with metric:

 FN-CB-410a.2 – Description of approach to incorporation of environmental, social, and governance
(ESG) factors in credit analysis
Adherence to Criteria for Accounting Metrics

The Commercial Banks Industry Provisional Standard included a topic, Integration of Environmental, Social, and

Governance Risk Factors in Credit Risk Analysis, with four associated metrics that described a company’s identification

and management of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) risks and opportunities in its loan portfolio.

Specifically, the topic and associated metrics provided relevant information regarding a company’s approach to

integrating ESG risks in credit analysis of borrowers at the stage of loan origination and servicing. Metrics FN0101-15

and FN0101-16 provided a qualitative description of the extent of a company’s ESG integration practices and the level

of its understanding of ESG exposure.

To improve relevance and decision-usefulness of the discussion generated by the metrics, the SASB merged metrics

FN0101-15 and FN0101-16 into a single metric with the title “Description of approach to incorporation of

environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors in credit analysis.” The revision does not change scope of

disclosure defined by metrics FN0101-15 and FN0101-16, but rather combines the metrics into a single metric and

revises the scope of disclosure to reference commonly accepted industry frameworks including the Principles for

Responsible Investment (PRI) and Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The revision to the

technical protocols enhances comparability, completeness, verifiability, and alignment criteria specified in the SASB

Conceptual Framework.

The SASB additionally revised the topic name from Integration of Environmental, Social, and Governance Risk Factors

in Credit Risk Analysis to Incorporation of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Factors in Credit Analysis to

better align with the industry terminology.

Supporting Analysis

The revised format of the technical protocol enhances the alignment of the standard with commonly referenced

external frameworks, such as that provided by the PRI in its Framework regarding the incorporation of ESG factors in

BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS | COMMERCIAL BANKS INDUSTRY | 25

investment management by companies. In the case of the Commercial Banks industry specifically, credit analysis of

loans can be viewed similarly to credit analysis of investments by fixed income asset managers. To further enhance the

alignment of the metric with external frameworks and provide decision-useful information to investors, the SASB asks

banks to discuss how they incorporate ESG factors when estimating credit losses over the contractual term of financial

assets. Disclosure related to estimation of credit losses is covered by the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (FASB)

Topic 326 “Financial Instruments – Credit Losses.”^21 Therefore, understanding how commercial banks incorporate ESG

factors in credit analysis, and specifically in estimating credit losses over the contractual term of financial instruments–

including origination, servicing, and maturity– would yield material information. Finally, the technical protocol was

revised to incorporate a discussion of scenario analysis and modeling used by banks in credit analysis; such analysis is

aligned with the recommendations of the TCFD.

The PRI is a widely recognized framework with around 1,800 signatories with close to $70 trillion of assets under

management (AUM)^22. Therefore, alignment of the SASB discussion with this widely-adopted framework is likely to

improve cost-effectiveness. Furthermore, alignment of the scope of disclosure and definitions (i.e., “incorporation of

ESG factors” and examples of ESG factors/issues) to the PRI enhances the comparability of the standard by providing

additional, specific guidance to companies regarding elements of the disclosure they shall include related to their

incorporation of ESG factors.

Finally, the completeness of disclosures associated with the metric is enhanced by providing additional guidance

regarding the scope of the technical protocol. Specifically, the revision to the technical protocol includes a discussion

of: (a) high-level approach, including policies set in place; (b) operational processes and procedures, including staff

involved, approach to implementation and oversight, assessment and review processes; and (c) technical aspects of

ESG incorporation such as scenario analysis and impact of ESG issues on analysts’ views on traditional fundamental

factors. These revisions enhance the scope of the metric by including strategic and operational elements of ESG

incorporation in addition to technical aspects, which was primarily the area covered by the original version of the

metric. Because the revised approach provides a more complete picture of company performance while remaining

aligned with existing, widely used frameworks, the revision is likely to improve both the cost-effectiveness and

decision-usefulness of disclosure generated by the metric.

Lastly, the SASB replaced the term “integration” with the term “incorporation” to improve alignment with the

industry terminology. The PRI defines “incorporation” of ESG factors broadly, where “integration of ESG issues” is

one of the four ways it can be done in practice. The other ways of ESG incorporation include screening, sustainability-

themed investment, or a combination of all three ways. As the scope of the disclosure topic and associated metrics

intends to capture a variety of approaches and strate gies to ESG incorporation, the change improves the

appropriateness of the name. Analysis of the SEC filings suggests that term “credit analysis” is used significantly more

often than term “credit risk analysis,” while also being broader, which is more aligned with the scope of the topic and

associated metrics.

Market Input

Companies: Companies strongly advocated for the alignment of the metrics with existent frameworks, specifically, the

TCFD as it pertained to the Commercial Banks industry , and the PRI and TCFD as it pertained to the Asset

Management & Custody Activities industry. Companies stated that with the emergence of several ESG frameworks in

recent years, compliance and reporting of ESG data is likely to become costly. Therefore, ensuring alignment across

such frameworks was highly advocated by companies in the industry to ensure the cost-effectiveness of disclosure.

Benefits

Improves decision-usefulness: The revision provides greater specificity regarding company efforts to integrate ESG

factors and thereby enhances the scope of disclosure by providing more complete, comparable, and therefore,

decision-useful disclosures to investors in assessing the quality of ESG incorporation in credit analysis.

Improves cost-effectiveness: The revision improves the cost-effectiveness of the standard by aligning the guidance

provided in the technical protocol with that of the PRI, the TCFD, and the FASB.

2017 Technical Agenda Item #2-6 Description

The SASB is evaluating the revision of metric FN0101-08^23 to ensure the relevance and decision-usefulness of the

metrics associated with the topic.

Summary of Change – Add Metric and Revise Metric

The SASB split metric:

 FN0101-08 – Amount of legal and regulatory fines and settlements associated with financial industry
regulation and percentage that resulted from whistleblowing actions
into its quantitative and qualitative components:

 FN-CB-510a.1 – Total amount of monetary losses as a result of legal proceedings associated with
fraud, insider trading, anti-trust, anti-competitive behavior, market manipulation, malpractice, or other
related financial industry laws or regulations
with a new metric subsequently created to capture whistleblower policies:

 FN-CB-510a.2 – Description of whistleblower policies and procedures
Adherence to Criteria for Accounting Metrics

The Commercial Banks Industry Provisional Standard included a topic, Management of the Legal & Regulatory

Environment^24 , which focused on a company’s management of risks related to the banking industry’s legal and

regulatory environment. Specifically, the topic and two associated quantitative metrics provided information to help

analysts assess a company’s internal control policies to prevent tax evasion, fraud, money laundering, and corruption.

The provisional metric FN0101-08 measured the amount of legal and regulatory fines and settlements, and the

percent that resulted from whistleblowing actions. The provisional metric was unlikely to provide a fair representation

and complete view of the topic and a company’s efforts and abilities to institute a successful whistleblower program,

which limits its decision-usefulness. The revision of the metric eliminates the need to disclose the percentage of fines

and settlements stemming from whistleblowers. To more adequately capture the nature of a company’s whistleblower

programs, the SASB added a qualitative metric that facilitates disclosure of the unique characteristics of a company’s

whistleblower policies and practices in a more holistic manner. In tandem, both metrics fairly represent the topic and

improve the completeness of the standard.

Supporting Analysis

The provisional metric FN0101-08 did not provide a complete picture of a company’s whistleblower programs, which

may reduce the decision-usefulness of the metric. During the consultation period (see Market Input), SASB received

BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS | COMMERCIAL BANKS INDUSTRY | 28

feedback noting that reporting on the issue generally includes the amount of fines and settlements related to

violations of financial industry regulations plus a stand-alone discussion of whistleblower policies. This was confirmed

by an analysis of current disclosure practices in SEC filings. As a set, the pair of revised metrics are more useful in

measuring a company’s performance on the topic because they provide a mix of quantitative and qualitative

information, which is a characteristic that the provisional metric lacked. Reporting on the share of fines resulting from

whistleblower action does not necessarily highlight the quality of a company’s whistleblower policies. For example, a

report from the Harvard Law School, “Elements of an Effective Whistleblower Hotline,” notes that “a high volume of

calls to a company’s hotline (as compared to peers and its industry) may indicate that the company is experiencing

significant compliance issues and potentially has an ineffective compliance and ethics program. Conversely, a high

volume of hotline calls may suggest that the hotline is working as planned, that the company’s compliance and ethics

employee training program is effective, that there is greater awareness of the hotline and increased trust in the

company’s compliance department.”^25 Splitting the metrics improves the completeness of the disclosure by allowing

investors to better understand the extent to which the volume of whistleblowing-related fines may be influenced by

the company’s policies regarding whistleblowing. The split improves the SASB criteria for fair representation and

usefulness by clarifying the links between whistleblowing policies and related fines.

Market Input

Investors and others: A limited number of investors provided feedback on the revision. Nevertheless, those who did

unanimously stated that the breakdown of regulatory fines and settlements resulting from whistleblowing actions is

unlikely to yield additional decision-useful information, and is therefore unnecessary. Alternatively, these analysts and

one subject matter expert recommended including a discussion of a company’s whistleblower policies. This is because

combined with other metrics proposed by SASB for this topic, it would provide a holistic view of the company’s

performance. Based on feedback from analysts, the share of fines resulting from whistleblower action does not

necessarily highlight the quality of a company’s whistleblower policies.

Companies: Five of the largest companies in the industry by market capitalization also suggested changing the metric

and including a qualitative discussion and analysis on any whistleblower policies and procedures a company has.

Benefits

Improves decision-usefulness: Splitting the current provisional metric into two different metrics improves the decision-

usefulness of disclosure by providing a mix of quantitative and qualitative information. The quantitative metric on fines

and settlements provides an indication of past performance on the topic, while a stand-alone qualitative discussion of

whistleblower policies and practices sheds light on a company’s unique whistleblower programs. In tandem, the

metrics fairly represent performance on the topic.

2017 Technical Agenda Item #2-7 Description

The SASB is evaluating the revision of metric FN0101-09^26 to ensure the relevance, decision-usefulness, and cost-

effectiveness of the metrics associated with the topic.

Summary of Change – Remove Metric

The SASB removed metric FN0101-09, “Number of inquiries, complaints, or issues received by the legal and

compliance office through an internal monitoring or reporting system, and percentage that were substantiated.”

Adherence to Criteria for Accounting Metrics

The Commercial Banks Industry Provisional Standard included a topic, Management of the Legal & Regulatory

Environment^27 , which focused on a company’s management of risks related to the Commercial Banks industry’s legal

and regulatory environment. Specifically, the topic and associated metrics provided information to help analysts assess

a company’s internal control policies to prevent tax evasion, fraud, money laundering, and corruption. Other metrics

in the topic included disclosure of the amount of legal and regulatory fines incurred that are associated with industry

regulation and a description of the company’s policies and procedures regarding internal whistleblowing. The

provisional metric FN0101-09 measured the number of inquiries, complaints, or issues received by the legal and

compliance office through an internal monitoring or reporting system, and the percentage that were substantiated.

This metric was meant to be an indicator of the effectiveness of a company’s internal compliance controls and a

forward-looking proxy for potential violations and subsequent fines and penalties. Nonetheless, as indicated by

feedback from companies, the provisional metric was lacking in comparability if reported, as companies have different

types of policies and procedures of internal controls, and therefore the number of inquiries could range significantly

and not be indicative of actual performance on the topic. The removal of the metric therefore retains the decision-

usefulness of the disclosures contained in the remaining metrics (please refer to Revision FN-CB:09) on the topic, while

reducing the cost burden of reporting and avoiding potential issues of comparability.

Supporting Analysis

The SASB’s analysis of company disclosures did not reveal instances where a company would disclose the number of

inquiries, complaints, or issues received by the legal and compliance offices. These findings echo the feedback

received from companies highlighting the issue of provisional metric FN0101-09 not being comparable, also affecting

its decision-usefulness and appropriateness as a measure of performance.

Market Input

Investors: Several investors stated that the metric would be challenging to interpret in a decision-useful manner.

Companies: All three large companies who provided comments on the disclosure topic unanimously expressed

concerns with provisional metric FN0101-09. Companies stated that it would not be cost-effective to obtain

information comparable across companies due to the fact that individual companies may have differences in their

internal compliance processes. The metric did not reference a recognized industry framework.

Benefits

Improves the SASB Standard: Removal of the metric improves comparability of the remaining set of disclosures. Given

that each company has different approaches to internal controls and reporting issues to internal compliance

departments, removal of the metric prevents disclosure comparability issues among companies.

Improves cost-effectiveness: The provisional metric would be very cost-burdensome to standardize to ensure

comparability, and therefore its removal improves cost-effectiveness.

Revision FN-CB:11 – Industry: Commercial Banks; Topic

Name: Management of the Legal & Regulatory Environment

Summary of Change – Revise Topic Name

The SASB revised the provisional topic name from Management of the Legal & Regulatory Environment to Business

Ethics.

Supporting Rationale

The disclosure topic is intended to capture investment banks’ adherence to a complex and inconsistent set of rules

relating to performance and conduct. In addition, the associated metrics encourage disclosure on issues, including

insider trading, anti-trust, price fixing, and market manipulation. As such, the topic is intended to measure companies’

policies and practices regarding potentially controversial issues, broadly defined as business ethics. On the other hand,

the SASB defines Management of the Legal & Regulatory Environment as a company's strategy and reliance upon

regulatory policy or monetary incentives (such as subsidies and taxes), its actions to influence industry policy (such as

through lobbying), overall reliance on a favorable regulatory environment for business competitiveness, and ability to

comply with relevant regulations. To better reflect the nature of the topic, the SASB has revised the topic name from

Management of the Legal & Regulatory Environment to Business Ethics.

Benefits

Improves the SASB Standard: The revision improves the clarity and accuracy of the disclosure topic name.

The SASB is evaluating the revision of metric FN0101-10^28 to ensure the decision-usefulness and cost-effectiveness of

the metrics associated with the topic.

Summary of Change – Revise Metric

The SASB revised metric:

 FN0101-10 – Results of stress tests under adverse economic scenarios, including the following
measures (actual and projection): (1) Loan losses (2) Losses, revenue, and net income before taxes (3)
Tier 1 common capital ratio (4) Tier 1 capital ratio (5) Total risk-based capital ratio (6) Tier 1 leverage
ratio
to metric:

 FN-CB-550a.2 – Description of approach to incorporation of results of mandatory and voluntary stress
tests into capital adequacy planning, long-term corporate strategy, and other business activities
Adherence to Criteria for Accounting Metrics

The Commercial Banks Industry Provisional Standard includes a topic, Systemic Risk Management, which focuses on a

financial institution’s capacity to operate after economic shocks and the degree to which its operations may affect

other companies and the broader economy. The need to preserve capital due to regulatory requirements means that

any decisions on how to deploy the firm’s financial capabilities should be carefully weighed against capital

requirements. The provisional metric FN0101-10 included reporting on results of regulatory stress tests under adverse

economic scenarios using several actual and projected quantitative indicators. As these data are currently disclosed in

detail, the SASB disclosure was unlikely to add value to the total mix of information provided to investors. The revised

metric is meant to help analysts assess the alignment of performance on regulatory metrics with the company’s long-

term sustainability strategy by providing a discussion of how the stress tests drive corporate strategy and other

business decisions. In particular, a discussion of how the integration of environmental, social, and governance (ESG)

factors in stress testing and the influence of stress test results on a company’s ESG strategy (see technical protocol),

provides information that can be decision-useful and is currently not disclosed.

Federal Reserve, with the latest round consisting of 33 bank holding companies.^29 The reports provide comparison

quantitative metric on companies’ Global Systemically Important Bank (G-SIB) score that provides a complete set of

quantitative data points relevant to the topic. The G-SIB score, calculated with inputs collected by regulators in G-20

countries, assesses the systemic risk a financial institution poses through a composite of several metrics. As such, the

revised metric adds to the completeness of the SASB Standard.

The revision to a qualitative discussion would be valuable to investors to understand how quantitative performance on

regulatory metrics relates to companies’ management of the material sustainability issue addressed in the SASB

Standard. Further, discussion of how ESG factors inform the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the stress tests’

modeling and analysis, as well as how the stress test results inform its approach with respect to its ESG strategy,

provides useful information to both companies and investors. Such discussion connects the regulatory and financial

aspects of the topic to its sustainability aspects, improving the completeness of the standard.

Market Input

Investors: Feedback from multiple investors suggests that the amount of information related to results of stress tests,

and the systemic risk in general– available through the Federal Reserve report, the Pillar 3 reports under Basel III, and

other sources– is sufficient to make informed investment decisions. Analysts suggest not to restate results of stress

tests in the standard but rather to provide discussion of a long-term strategy to adapt to an evolving regulatory

environment and to absorb shocks arising from financial and economic stress.

Companies: All companies support the change from results of SASB-specific stress tests to qualitative discussion and

analysis. Companies stated that the existent amount of quantitative data reported satisfy regulatory requirements and

investor demand on the topic. As supported by feedback, the current amount of disclosure with respect to stress tests

is sufficient and the provisional metric does not contribute to the completeness of information. Therefore, duplicating

such disclosure would not be beneficial.

Benefits

Improves the SASB Standard : Duplicating results of the stress tests, in this specific case, would not provide additional

value to investors. The data investors can obtain from regulatory filings on results of stress tests is already complete

and sufficient to make informed decisions. The revised metric is likely to add value to the total mix of information

rather than be duplicative. It allows companies to connect their regulatory performance with the sustainability topic

that is found to be material for the industry.

Improves cost-effectiveness: By reducing the amount of data required from companies, SASB improves cost-

effectiveness of the standard.

Improves decision-usefulness: As indicated by feedback from investors, discussion of companies’ strategy would

provide more additional decision-useful information than results of stress tests.

the alignment, decision-usefulness, and cost-effectiveness of the metrics associated with the topic.

Summary of Change – Revise Metrics

The SASB removed the following provisional metrics:

 FN0101-11 – Basel III Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR)
 FN0101-12 – Net exposure to written credit derivatives
 FN0101-13 – Level 3 assets: (1) total value and (2) percentage of total assets
 FN0101-14 – Skewness and kurtosis of trading revenue
The SASB is replacing them with a new metric:

 FN-CB-550a.1 – Global Systemically Important Bank (G-SIB) score, by category
Adherence to Criteria for Accounting Metrics

The Commercial Banks Industry Provisional Standard includes a topic, Systemic Risk Management, which describes a

financial institution’s capacity to operate after economic shocks and the degree to which its operations may affect

other companies and the broader economy.

The provisional metrics FN0101-11, FN0101-12, FN0101-13, and FN0101-14 included some, but not all, of the

measures of systemic risk normally disclosed in regulatory stress test results. Consequently, they were insufficiently

complete, according to the criteria for accounting metrics established in the SASB Conceptual Framework.

The SASB replaced the aforementioned provisional metrics with one metric measuring G-SIB score. The change

improves the completeness of the metrics associated with the topic while fairly representing a company’s

performance, as it encompasses a broader view of systemic risk that can be condensed into a single indicator, rather

than the multiple measures included in the Provisional Standard. It also adds to the comparability and alignment of

the metrics associated with the topic, as data for the G-SIB score are calculated using standardized methodology and

are already collected by most industry participants and reported to regulators.

Supporting Analysis

The provisional metrics represented only individual elements of the relevant information investors need to assess a

company’s performance on the topic. The replacement metric measures how a company manages its capital

requirements and whether it is well positioned to absorb shocks arising from financial and economic stress. The G-SIB

score is a measure of the degree to which a bank may pose a risk to the financial system. By measuring a bank’s

relative score in five major categories (size, interconnectedness, complexity, cross-jurisdictional activity, and

substitutability), the metric accounts for different factors that gauge the systemic risk that the institution poses. The

data are already disclosed to national regulators and made public for most of the U.S.’s larger institutions, along with

similar standards existing in other jurisdictions. By using a single metric, the revision improves the completeness of

data provided to investors while fairly representing performance on the topic. Banks with over $50 billion in assets are

required to collect and report the data underlying the calculation of G-SIB scores. The methodology for calculating the

scores for each category takes into account performance on the provisional SASB metrics being replaced, as well as

other applicable indicators that address the scope of the issue holistically.

G-SIB scores are calculated based on a global methodology that ensures comparability and alignment of the SASB

metric. The data used to calculate G-SIB scores, the methodology, and the scores themselves are publicly available on

the Office of Financial Research’s website.^34 Further, companies have established frameworks for collecting and

reporting the underlying data, which makes reporting the revised metric cost-effective.

Market Input

Investors: Multiple investors stated that the provisional metrics are relevant, but represent only a subset of all the

relevant indicators. Therefore, the provisional metrics are not complete in measuring performance on the issue.

Investor feedback indicated that the provisional metrics seemed to be chosen at random from the list of all metrics

regulated under Dodd-Frank and Basel III. Analysts suggested either to go broader with metrics or not to duplicate

measures at all. The G-SIB metric was recommended by one investor as the most decision-useful measure of systemic

risk combined into a concise measure.

Companies: The SASB did not receive feedback from companies specifically related to the usefulness of the revised

metric.

Others: Subject matter experts confirmed the decision-usefulness and relevance of the G-SIB metric and its breakdown

by five categories.

Benefits

Improves decision-usefulness: The G-SIB metric satisfies the SASB’s goal of providing a minimal set of decision-useful

metrics. The G-SIB sub-scores, such as interconnectedness, complexity, and substitutability, incorporate all the

elements of the topic the SASB considers to be relevant from the sustainability point of view. As such, the revision

improves the ability of the metrics associated with the topic to provide a complete and fair representation of

performance in a way that is comparable among peers and aligned with industry practices.

Improves cost-effectiveness: By providing alignment with an existing methodology used by industry companies, the

revised metric is more cost-effective to report.

Revision FN-CB:14 – Industry: Commercial Banks; Topic

Name: Activity Metrics

2017 Technical Agenda Item #2-12 Description

The SASB proposes to include activity metrics for the Commercial Banks industry.

Summary of Change – Add Activity Metrics

The SASB added the following activity metrics:

 FN-CB-000.A – (1) Number and (2) value of checking and savings accounts by segment: (a) personal
and (b) small business
 FN-CB-000.B – (1) Number and (2) value of loans by segment: (a) personal, (b) small business, and (c)
corporate
Note: Mortgage loans as well as revolving credit loans would be excluded from the scope of disclosure as they are

addressed in the Mortgage Finance and Consumer Finance industries.

Supporting Analysis

The SASB added activity metrics to its standards for industries in the Financials sector, including the Commercial Banks

industry. At the time of release of the Provisional Standards, the SASB had not incorporated the concept of activity

metrics into the industry standards. Activity metrics are useful for measuring the scope and scale of a company’s

operations, providing normalization factors for the performance metrics included in the disclosure topics.

The added activity metrics are aligned with information that is commonly disclosed in SEC filings by industry firms. The

Bloomberg Professional Services software includes dedicated data fields for number of checking accounts, consumer

loans, and corporate loans. Aggregate data by the Federal Reserve show^35 that as of the end of June 2017, deposits

represented just below 81 percent of total liabilities on a seasonally adjusted basis. Loans represented 57 percent of

the aggregate assets on banks’ balance sheets. The SASB analysis of corporate disclosure suggests that value of

accounts is commonly reported by banks, unlike the number of accounts, which is only reported by two out of the top

five U.S. banks by market capitalization. Similarly, banks report the value of loans originated, but none report the total

number.

Both the number and value of loans are useful indicators, as one or the other activity metric can be used to normalize

reported information, depending on the topic and associated accounting metrics. For example, in the case of data

security risks, assessing the scope of exposure in terms of the number of individual customer accounts may be a more

appropriate indicator of cybersecurity risk than the total value of those accounts.

June 8, 2018, accessed October 5, 2018, https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h8/current/default.htm.

BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS | COMMERCIAL BANKS INDUSTRY | 38

Market Input

Investors: Consultation on the activity metrics was not a priority for the SASB. Nevertheless, the SASB received

feedback from a number of investors (all analysts who commented on the included activity metrics) that the included

activity metrics are relevant, decision-useful, and partially disclosed already.

Companies: The SASB received feedback from one of the largest integrated banks that the revised metrics are cost-

effective to report as they are aligned with internally collected information and, for the most part, are already

disclosed.

Benefits

Improves the SASB Standard: Activity metrics provide investors with normalization factors to ensure the comparability

of performance metrics across companies.

Improves decision-usefulness: The revised metrics improve the decision-usefulness of all quantitative metrics included

in the standard by allowing investors to convert them from absolute to relative measures of performance.

Appendix B. Redline Metric Tables

Redline tables are provided below for all sustainability accounting metrics (Table 1) and activity metrics (Table 2). All

significant revisions to topics and metrics between the provisional standard and the codified standard are shown in

redline; however, such redlines are not intended to communicate the full scope of such revisions, for which readers

should refer to the codified Standard and accompanying content elsewhere in the Basis for Conclusions.

All redlines presented in these tables are associated with a revision number in the Revision Number column. Significant

revisions to the technical protocol associated with a given metric will not necessarily be apparent in redline in the

tables; however, the associated revision number will be noted in the Revision Number column of each table.

Any redlines that depict revisions to metrics but that are not accompanied by a revision number (i.e., “n/a”) are not

addressed in the Basis for Conclusions as these revisions have not altered the scope or content of metrics, such as

those that are intended to improve the consistency, clarity, and accuracy of the standard. Similarly, if a metric is not

accompanied by a revision number, the technical protocol may have been revised to improve the consistency, clarity,

and accuracy of the standard.

These materials were developed under the auspices of the SASB Foundation. The SASB Foundation was founded in 2011

as a not-for-profit, independent standards-setting organization. The SASB Foundation’s mission was to establish and

maintain industry-specific standards that assist companies in disclosing financially material, decision-useful sustainability

information to investors. The SASB Foundation operated in a governance structure similar to the structure adopted by other

internationally recognized bodies that set standards for disclosure to investors, including the Financial Accounting Standards

Board (FASB) and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). This structure included a board of directors (“the

Foundation Board”) and a standards-setting board (“the Standards Board” or “the SASB”). The Standards Board developed,

issued, and maintained the SASB Standards. The Foundation Board oversaw the strategy, finances, and operations of

the entire organization, and appointed the members of the Standards Board. The Foundation Board was not involved in

setting standards, but was responsible for overseeing the Standards Board’s compliance with the organization’s due process

requirements. As set out in the SASB Rules of Procedure, the SASB’s standards-setting activities were transparent and

followed careful due process, including extensive consultation with companies, investors, and relevant experts. The SASB

Foundation was funded by a range of sources, including contributions from philanthropies, companies, and individuals, as

well as through the sale and licensing of publications, educational materials, and other products.

INTRODUCTION

Purpose of SASB Standards

The SASB’s use of the term “sustainability” refers to corporate activities that maintain or enhance the ability of the

company to create value over the long term. Sustainability accounting reflects the governance and management of a

company’s environmental and social impacts arising from production of goods and services, as well as its governance and

management of the environmental and social capitals necessary to create long-term value. The SASB also refers to

sustainability as “ESG” (environmental, social, and governance), though traditional corporate governance issues such as

board composition are not included within the scope of the SASB’s standards-setting activities.

SASB standards are designed to identify a minimum set of sustainability issues most likely to impact the operating

performance or financial condition of the typical company in an industry, regardless of location. SASB standards are

designed to enable communications on corporate performance on industry-level sustainability issues in a cost-effective

and decision-useful manner using existing disclosure and reporting mechanisms.

Businesses can use the SASB standards to better identify, manage, and communicate to investors sustainability

information that is financially material. Use of the standards can benefit businesses by improving transparency, risk

management, and performance. SASB standards can help investors by encouraging reporting that is comparable,

consistent, and financially material, thereby enabling investors to make better investment and voting decisions.

Overview of SASB Standards

The SASB has developed a set of 77 industry-specific sustainability accounting standards (“SASB standards” or “industry

standards”), categorized pursuant to SASB’s Sustainable Industry Classification System® (SICS®). Each SASB standard

describes the industry that is the subject of the standard, including any assumptions about the predominant business

model and industry segments that are included. SASB standards include:

Disclosure topics – A minimum set of industry-specific disclosure topics reasonably likely to constitute material
information, and a brief description of how management or mismanagement of each topic may affect value creation.

Accounting metrics – A set of quantitative and/or qualitative accounting metrics intended to measure performance
on each topic.

Technical protocols – Each accounting metric is accompanied by a technical protocol that provides guidance on
definitions, scope, implementation, compilation, and presentation, all of which are intended to constitute suitable criteria

for third-party assurance.

Activity metrics – A set of metrics that quantify the scale of a company’s business and are intended for use in
conjunction with accounting metrics to normalize data and facilitate comparison.

SUSTAINABILITY ACCOUNTING STANDARD | COMMERCIAL BANKS | 4

Furthermore, the SASB Standards Application Guidance establishes guidance applicable to the use of all industry

standards and is considered part of the standards. Unless otherwise specified in the technical protocols contained in the

industry standards, the guidance in the SASB Standards Application Guidance applies to the definitions, scope,

implementation, compilation, and presentation of the metrics in the industry standards.

The SASB Conceptual Framework sets out the basic concepts, principles, definitions, and objectives that guide the

Standards Board in its approach to setting standards for sustainability accounting. The SASB Rules of Procedure is focused

on the governance processes and practices for standards setting.

Use of the Standards

SASB standards are intended for use in communications to investors regarding sustainability issues that are likely to

impact corporate ability to create value over the long term. Use of SASB standards is voluntary. A company determines

which standard(s) is relevant to the company, which disclosure topics are financially material to its business, and which

associated metrics to report, taking relevant legal requirements into account^1. In general, a company would use the SASB

standard specific to its primary industry as identified in SICS®. However, companies with substantial business in multiple

SICS® industries can consider reporting on these additional SASB industry standards.

It is up to a company to determine the means by which it reports SASB information to investors. One benefit of using

SASB standards may be achieving regulatory compliance in some markets. Other investor communications using SASB

information could be sustainability reports, integrated reports, websites, or annual reports to shareholders. There is no

guarantee that SASB standards address all financially material sustainability risks or opportunities unique to a company’s

business model.

Industry Description

Commercial banks accept deposits and make loans to individuals and corporations as well as engage in lending for

infrastructure, real estate, and other projects. By providing these services, the industry serves an essential role in the

functioning of global economies and in facilitating the transfer of financial resources to their most productive capacity.

The industry is driven by the volume of deposits, quality of loans made, the economic environment, and interest rates. It is

further characterized by risk from mismatched assets and liabilities. The regulatory environment that governs the

commercial banking industry saw significant changes in the wake of the financial crisis of 2008 and continues to evolve

today. These and other regulatory trends have the potential to impact shareholder value and sustainability performance.

Commercial banks with global operations must manage new regulations in multiple jurisdictions that are creating

regulatory uncertainty, particularly around consistent application of new rules.

Note: The SASB Commercial Banks (FN-CB) Standard addresses “pure play” commercial banking services, which the SASB

recognizes may not include all the activities of integrated financial institutions, such as investment banking and brokerage

(^1) Legal Note : SASB standards are not intended to, and indeed cannot, replace any legal or regulatory requirements that may be
applicable to a reporting entity’s operations.

services, mortgage finance, consumer finance, asset management and custody services, and insurance. Separate SASB

accounting standards are available that address the sustainability issues for activities in those industries.

Data Security

Topic Summary

Ensuring the privacy and data security of personal financial data is an essential responsibility of the Commercial Banks

industry. Companies that fail to manage performance in this area are susceptible to decreased revenue and consumer

confidence. As growth in mobile banking and cloud storage continues and more of banks’ operations become

technology- and internet-dependent, data security will be an increasingly important issue to manage. Sophisticated

technology and continuous training of personnel are essential in a world of growing cybersecurity threats. The metrics for

this disclosure topic focus on providing more detail on efforts related to safeguarding data against emerging and

continuously evolving cybersecurity threats and technologies, and actual security breaches compromising customers'

personally identifiable information (PII). Enhanced disclosure on management strategies to address these risks will allow

shareholders to understand how commercial banks are protecting shareholder value.

Accounting Metrics

Financial Inclusion & Capacity Building

Topic Summary

Commercial banks, as their primary business activity, have to continuously balance their capacity building efforts with the

risks and opportunities associated with lending to unbanked, underbanked, or underserved customers. Emerging

financing models and technologies provide banks with an opportunity to offer products and services in previously

underserved markets and obtain additional sources of revenue. Firms that are able to meet the need to extend credit and

financial services to low-income populations and small businesses while avoiding predatory and irresponsible lending

practices are likely to create long-term value and enhance social capital. These services should also be complemented by

efforts to improve financial literacy, which will ensure that customers make informed decisions. The recent financial crisis

demonstrated the importance of diversified and resilient funding sources that these communities can provide. By

disclosing their approach to financial inclusion and capacity building, commercial banks can provide investors with

decision-useful information for assessing banks' ability to ensure long-term, sustainable value creation.

Incorporation of Environmental, Social, and Governance

Factors in Credit Analysis

Topic Summary

As financial intermediaries, commercial banks contribute to significant positive and negative environmental and social

externalities through their lending practices. Therefore, environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors can have

material implications for the underlying companies, assets, and projects that commercial banks lend to across a range of

industries. It is therefore increasingly necessary for companies to examine ESG factors when determining the quality of

collateral. Commercial banks also have the potential to enable positive environmental and social externalities and to

generate significant revenue streams through their lending practices. Commercial banks that fail to address these risks

and opportunities could face diminished returns and reduced value for shareholders. Commercial banks should

subsequently disclose how ESG factors are integrated into lending processes and the current level of portfolio risk

associated with specific sustainability trends. In particular, investor and regulatory pressure is mounting for banks to

disclose how they address climate change related risks.

Business Ethics

Topic Summary

The regulatory environment surrounding the Commercial Banks industry continues to evolve in various jurisdictions

globally. Commercial banks must adhere to a complex and inconsistent set of rules relating to performance and conduct

as well as disclosure on issues including insider trading, anti-trust, price fixing, and market manipulation. In addition,

commercial banks are subject to rules against tax evasion, fraud, money laundering, and corrupt practices. Finally, in some

jurisdictions, enhanced rewards for whistleblowers may increase the number of complaints brought to regulators. Firms

that are able to ensure regulatory compliance through robust internal controls will be better positioned to build trust with

clients, leading to increased revenue, and to protect shareholder value by minimizing losses incurred as a result of legal

proceedings.

Systemic Risk Management

Topic Summary

The 2008 financial crisis highlighted the importance of managing risks to capital in the Commercial Banks industry.

Specifically, firms that failed to manage the risk suffered significant losses to the value of their financial assets while

increasing the amount of liabilities held on their books, which, due to the interconnectedness of the financial system,

contributed to a significant market disruption. The systemic nature of the risk results from the interconnectedness of

financial institutions and has become a central concern of national and international regulators. As a result, many banks

are required to undergo supervisory stress tests to evaluate whether the company has the capital to absorb losses,

continue operations, and meet obligations in the event of adverse economic and financial conditions. Their failure to

meet regulatory requirements could substantially raise future compliance cost as well as lead to monetary penalties. In an

effort to demonstrate how the risks associated with banks’ size, complexity, interconnectedness, substitutability, and

cross-jurisdictional activity are being managed, commercial banks should enhance disclosure on quantitative and

qualitative metrics measuring how well they are positioned to absorb shocks arising from financial and economic stress

and meet stricter regulatory requirements.

Accounting Metrics

CITI 2021 ESG REPORT 4

Letter from Our CEO

As I write this note in late April, a war is raging

in Ukraine with significant global ramifications.

From the beginning, we have prioritized the

humanitarian crisis, doing everything we can

to help the people in Ukraine, including our

own colleagues, whilst keeping our business

there operating so we can support critical

supply chains and the NGOs delivering essen-

tial aid. We are also helping our multinational

clients who have decided to wind down their

business in Russia.

Although it might be too early to predict the

war’s long-term impact on the world order, it’s

not too soon to begin asking what it means for

the issues at the heart of our ESG agenda — and

the ESG agendas of so many other companies.

I recently returned from seeing clients in Europe

and the Middle East, and it is security — be it

energy, food, defense, cyber or operational —

that’s now consuming their attention. The

challenges facing our society have not only

reinforced the need for businesses such as Citi

to step up, but also the critical importance of

collaboration on a global scale.

Consider the climate crisis. At Citi, we’ve been

proud to play a leading role in our industry’s

drive to a more sustainable future, and in

recent months, we released our initial plan for

reaching net zero emissions by 2050. But

Russia’s role as a major energy producer is

forcing governments to reevaluate their

energy security and supply. Ultimately,

combating climate change cannot be done by

any company or country alone; we need

businesses making the right investments to

achieve the necessary shift in supply, and

consumers joining companies in advocating

for governments to create the policy frame-

works that will be essential to stimulating

demand for clean technologies and providing

the foundation for the clean energy transition.

This tension, of course, is not new. While

Citi plays an enabling role in the transition

to a net zero economy, we understand that

it cannot occur overnight. We have to be

thoughtful with the transition, meeting our
clients where they are in their efforts, and
then helping and pushing them to accelerate
their low-carbon transitions.
Similarly, our efforts to expand financial
access and opportunity have also gained new
urgency. We have engaged every level of our
business to think and act in support of equity
and the goal of helping close the racial wealth
gap and increase economic mobility in the
United States. In order to effectively do this
work and serve our clients and communities,
we’ve set — and recently exceeded — talent
representation goals to further diversify our
own workforce and make progress toward pay
equity at Citi.
We also continue to advance financial inclusion
in underserved communities globally, expanding
the scope of our work to areas such as health-
care, education, affordable housing and basic
infrastructure. These efforts have become
even more important amidst surging inflation
and an emerging global food crisis that could
be devastating for the world’s poorest coun-
tries, which import much of their food and
where households spend more than half of
their income on food.
There are, of course, lessons to learn and
apply to these challenges, particularly from the
pandemic. COVID-19’s disregard for borders
underscored the interconnectedness of society.
It also reminded us that global challenges
demand a global, collective response. As the
world becomes more fragmented, it is even
more important for our global community of
business to come together to confront the big
challenges of our time.
At Citi, this sense of responsibility is something
that continues to shape our decisions, business
strategy, and firm-wide goals and commit-
ments. We continue to be focused on action
and partnering with like-minded organizations
that are also doing the work. And for us, it’s
not just about the big numbers; it’s the small
number — helping society get closer to zero.
Zero carbon emissions. Zero wealth gap.
Zero pay gap. Zero poverty. Some might say
this is idealistic, but having ambitious goals
is what helps us make meaningful progress.
And it’s going to take all of us, working
together, to make sure we continue to go in
the right direction.
I invite you to learn more about these initiatives
in the pages that follow. Our ESG agenda is not
a separate layer that sits above what we do
day-to-day. It is an effort that we began at Citi
many years ago that has become core to who
we are as a company and our daily worth as a
bank. While our efforts will continue to evolve to
reflect new global challenges, our commitment
to transparency and accountability will remain
constant. We will continue to share our progress
and lessons learned, and we will continue to
innovate and push to use our core capabilities,
expertise and talent to lead by example and
demonstrate how Citi is truly a bank with a
brain and a soul.

Citi’s mission is to serve as a trusted part-

ner to our clients by responsibly providing

financial services that enable growth and

economic progress. Our core activities are

safeguarding assets, lending money, mak-

ing payments and accessing the capital

markets on behalf of our clients. We have

over 200 years of experience helping our

clients meet the world’s toughest challeng-

es and embrace its greatest opportunities.

As an institution, Citi is connecting millions

of people across hundreds of countries

and cities.

We protect people’s savings and help

them make the purchases — from everyday

transactions to buying a home — that

improve the quality of their lives. We

advise people on how to invest for future
needs, such as their children’s education
and their own retirement, and help them
buy securities such as stocks and bonds.
We work with companies to optimize their
daily operations, whether they need
working capital, to make payroll or to
export their goods overseas. By lending to
companies large and small, we help them
grow, creating jobs and real economic
value at home and in communities around
the world. We provide financing and
support to governments at all levels, so
they can build sustainable infrastructure,
such as housing, transportation, schools
and other vital public works.
We have an obligation to act responsibly.
We also know that acting responsibly
and sustainably will help to drive value
for our different stakeholders and for
our company. If we fall short, we will take
action and learn from our experience.
We strive to earn and maintain the
public’s trust by constantly adhering to
the highest ethical standards. We ask our
colleagues to ensure that their decisions
pass three tests: They are in our clients’
interests, create economic value, and
are always systemically responsible.
When we do these things well, we make a
positive financial and social impact in the
communities we serve and show what a
global bank can do.

Our ESG Strategy

Through our business, we address

some of society’s greatest

challenges. In recent years, we

have continued to advance our

leadership and partnerships

across the industry as we further

hone our environmental, social

and governance (ESG) strategy

and approach to managing

ESG issues and opportunities.

Helping to close the racial wealth gap

in the United States ranks among our

top priorities, and in 2021, we made

tremendous progress on our Action for

Racial Equity commitment, working across

our businesses to identify ways we can

help address the racial wealth gap. As

of November 2021 — one year into our

three-year commitment — Citi and the Citi

Foundation had already invested $1 billion

in strategic initiatives to help close the

racial wealth gap and increase economic

mobility in the United States. We committed

to conduct a third-party racial equity audit

to evaluate our Action for Racial Equity

goals and launched the Diverse Financial

Institutions Group, a centralized team

within Citi that is serving as a hub to lead

and expand firm-wide engagement with

minority depository institutions (MDIs),

diverse broker-dealers and diverse asset

managers. Read more about our racial

equity initiatives in the Equitable and

Resilient Communities section.

Additionally in 2021, we announced two

significant, new ESG commitments: a

pledge to achieve net zero greenhouse

gas (GHG) emissions by 2050 and a

commitment of $1 trillion in sustainable

finance by 2030 to address the impacts

of climate change and other pivotal

environmental and social issues that

align with the United Nations Sustainable

Development Goals (SDGs). These followed
our most recent Sustainable Progress
Strategy, which we launched one year
earlier. Our ESG strategy is a central
element of our business model and critical
to our strategy for growth.
To help us achieve our $500 Billion Social
Finance Goal, we broadened the focus of
the Citi Social Finance team (formerly Citi
Inclusive Finance) to develop platforms
and client solutions to help expand
financial inclusion, accelerate access to
basic services, boost job creation and
scale social infrastructure development in
emerging markets.
We believe that global financial institutions
like Citi have the opportunity — and the
responsibility — to play a leading role
in helping to drive the transition to a
low-carbon economy. We are prepared
to implement the significant changes
needed in our business, and to support the
substantial changes that will be required
for the world to transition and align with
the goals of the Paris Agreement.

CITI 2021 ESG REPORT 8

Net zero involves rethinking our business

and helping our clients rethink theirs. We

can have the biggest impact by reducing

Scope 3 financed emissions,^1 particularly

for carbon-intensive sectors such as

Agriculture, Aluminum, Cement, Coal,

Commercial Real Estate, Iron and Steel, Oil

and Gas, Power Generation and Transport.

To reach our net zero target, we will need

to work closely with our clients on their

own transitions.

Following our net zero announcement,

we formed an internal Net Zero Task

Force to help determine a framework,

scope and the methodologies to guide our

progress toward this commitment. For

our Energy and Power loan portfolios, we

conducted an initial assessment of base-

line emissions, set interim 2030 emissions

reduction targets, and developed initial

transition plans. Learn more in the Climate

Risk & Net Zero section and in our 2021

Task Force on Climate-related Financial

Disclosures (TCFD) Report: Citi’s Approach

to Climate Change and Net Zero.

ESG Across

Our Business

Our ESG focus is essential to our firm-wide

business strategy, and many of our busi-

ness units have expanded their capacity

and capabilities to serve the growing

ESG-related needs of our clients. Across

the firm, our business units are prepared

to support and work with our clients

through sustainable finance, providing

a variety of products and services with

environmental and/or social themes.

We have ESG specialists in Banking, Capital

Markets and Advisory; Global Markets;

Treasury and Trade Solutions; and Citi

Global Wealth. We have expanded our

global Social Finance specialist group and

formed new teams to engage with clients

on ESG goals and targets. Together, these
businesses contribute to our $1 trillion
sustainable finance commitment.
ESG Principles

and Guidelines

In response to the increasing need for
clients to see how we are addressing
ESG — and in step with global best prac-
tices — we have aligned our reporting
with the frameworks and guidance of the
Global Reporting Initiative and UN Guiding
Principles Reporting Framework. We are
also using three relevant sector standards
from the Sustainability Accounting
Standards Board, and we’re addressing
the Principles for Responsible Banking.
We also include examples of our work that
align with the UN SDGs and the UN Global
Compact. In addition, we recently released
our 2021 TCFD Report, which further
illustrates how climate-related risks and
opportunities are central to our business.
Financed emissions are the GHG emissions generated by the operations and entities that financial institutions lend money to or invest in.

CITI 2021 ESG REPORT 9

ESG Governance at Citi

Good governance is a fundamental

principle at Citi, and we work to

ensure that we are at the leading

edge of best practices. We strive

to maintain the highest standards

of ethical conduct — reporting

with accuracy and transparency

and complying with the laws, rules

and regulations that govern Citi’s

businesses.

Corporate Governance

Our governance structures, policies and

processes serve employee, client and

community needs; promote a culture of

accountability and ethical conduct across

our firm; and support our commitment

to address global challenges through our

core business.

Citi’s Board of Directors plays an

important role in providing oversight of

our efforts to ensure responsible business

practices. For example, the Personnel

and Compensation Committee reviews

all compensation programs, including

incentive compensation, so that they

do not, among other things, encourage

imprudent risk taking. The Nomination,

Governance and Public Affairs Committee

(NGPAC) oversees Citi’s global ESG

activities and performance. Our Ethics,

Conduct and Culture Committee reflects

our commitment to promote a strong

culture of ethical conduct. The Risk

Management Committee also provides

oversight of climate risk.

Standing committees of our Board include:

- Audit
- Ethics, Conduct and Culture
- Executive
- Nomination, Governance and

Public Affairs
- Personnel and Compensation
- Risk Management

In addition, the Board formed the
Transformation Oversight Committee, an
ad hoc committee to provide oversight of
management’s remediation of the issues
identified in the consent orders with the
Federal Reserve Board and Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency.
See our website for more information
about Citi’s corporate governance, includ-
ing our Board committee charters. See our
2021 TCFD Report for details on our gover-
nance for climate change specifically.
ESG Governance

The NGPAC oversees our ESG activities.
This committee’s responsibilities include
reviewing our policies and programs for
sustainability, climate change, human
rights, diversity and other material ESG
issues, as well as advising on engage-
ment with external stakeholders. For
more information on the roles and
responsibilities of this committee, see
the Nomination, Governance and Public
Affairs Committee charter.
In July 2021, we formed a new Global ESG
Council to provide a senior management
forum for oversight of our ESG commit-
ments and ambition. The formation of
the Council highlights our commitment to
ESG matters, including our climate-related
strategies, at the highest level of our
organization. Chaired by our CEO, the
Council meets on a near-monthly basis
and includes members of the Executive
Management Team as well as internal

including the Climate Risk Steering

Group, the Net Zero Task Force and

Global Sustainability Steering Committee,

continue to operate, and the leads of

those steering groups are members of and

provide reports to the Global ESG Council.

Sustainability and

Climate Change

Citi’s Board of Directors and senior

management continue to expand the

governance of climate risk and integrate

climate considerations into their priorities.

In 2021, in addition to the announcement

of our net zero commitment and the

creation of our new Global ESG Council, we

accomplished the following:

- Grew our dedicated Climate Risk team

with additional expertise in credit risk,
scenario analysis, stress testing and
regulatory engagement
- Rolled out our first training module on

climate risk
- Created the Natural Resources & Clean

Energy Transition team to combine
our Energy, Power and Chemicals
businesses in order to assist our clients
across these sectors as they transition
- Established our Net Zero Task Force, a

cross-functional group to support the
development and launch of our net zero
plan. The Task Force is led by our Chief
Sustainability Officer and includes
leaders from diverse business units
such as Independent Risk Management;
Banking, Capital Markets, and Advisory;
Global Markets; Personal Banking &
Wealth Management; as well as Global
Public Affairs, Enterprise Operations &
Technology, Legal and Finance.
The Board and senior management have

also increased the frequency and depth of

conversations regarding climate matters.

Citi’s Board has ultimate oversight of Citi’s
approaches to considering, evaluating
and integrating climate-related risks and
opportunities throughout the organization.
The Board receives reports from key
personnel on Citi’s progress and key issues
on a periodic basis. In addition to reporting
to the full Board, the NGPAC provides
oversight of sustainability activities and
performance generally and the firm’s
climate change efforts specifically, and
the Risk Management Committee (RMC)
provides oversight of climate change risk.
The NGPAC receives periodic updates from
Citi’s Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO)
and the head of Community Investing and
Development. The NGPAC also reviews
Citi’s governance and significant policies
and programs for sustainability and
climate change issues and advises manage-
ment on our engagement with investors
and external stakeholders on these topics.
For more information on the roles and
responsibilities of the NGPAC, please see
our NGPAC Charter. The RMC provides
oversight of Citi’s Risk Management
function and reviews Citi’s risk policies and
frameworks. For more information on the
roles and responsibilities of this commit-
tee, please see our RMC Charter.
In 2020 into 2021, the NGPAC reviewed
and discussed investor and market devel-
opments related to net zero, including a
shareholder proposal pertaining to net
zero, and considerations for Citi as it delib-
erated on the implications of a potential
net zero commitment. These discussions
continued with the full Board throughout
During 2021, the full Board partic-
ipated in a climate education session
facilitated by the Head of Climate Risk, the
CSO and the Head of Corporate Banking.
The full Board received reports from the
CSO regarding sustainability activities and
performance, including those related to
climate change and Citi’s net zero plan,
and the RMC received reports from the
Head of Climate Risk regarding emerging
bank regulatory trends on climate risk and
Citi’s approach to meeting them. Members
of the Board also participated in investor
calls on a variety of governance, climate
risk and environmental and social matters.
Senior managers from Global Public
Affairs, Risk, Finance, Legal, Operations
& Technology and various business units
from our Institutional Clients Group also
contribute expertise to address the chal-
lenges presented by climate change.

Community Investing

Citi Community Investing and Development
(CID) is an integrated team that works
across Citi’s businesses and functions to
catalyze positive social impact in commu-
nities around the world.
CID comprises the following teams:
- Citi Impact Fund invests in “double
bottom line” companies that are
addressing societal challenges,
including workforce development,
sustainability, physical and social
infrastructure, and financial inclusion.
- Citi Social Finance works across Citi
businesses globally to catalyze scalable
business platforms and client solutions
that enable the bank, our clients
and our partners to expand financial
inclusion, accelerate access to basic
services, boost job creation and scale
social infrastructure development in
emerging markets.
- U.S. Business Partnerships leads Citi’s
relationships with national civil rights
and consumer protection organizations
to gain insights into issues affecting
low- and moderate-income communi-
ties and communities of color, and
catalyze product and service innova-
tions that help expand financial access
and close the racial wealth gap.

CITI 2021 ESG REPORT 11

- The U.S. Community Relations team,

which includes Citi Volunteers,
catalyzes social impact by engaging
and partnering with local community
leaders and organizations across the
country. The team connects Citi’s
people, expertise, resources, products
and services to help expand equitable
opportunities for all.
The Citi Foundation is a separate legal

entity funded by Citi to organize flagship

community programming in three areas:

youth economic opportunities, financial

inclusion and community solutions.

Underlying our approach is the notion

that complex societal challenges require

multifaceted solutions. We strive to share

our expertise with, and learn from, our

partners and stakeholders about ways

we can enhance impact. This approach

contributes directly to the UN Sustainable

Development Goal SDG 17 , which seeks to

strengthen the means of implementation

and revitalize the global partnership for

sustainable development. In particular,

Citi’s efforts contribute to target 17.3 ,

which seeks to mobilize additional finan-

cial resources for developing countries

from multiple sources , including the

private sector, to ensure that sufficient

financing is available to achieve the SDGs.

Talent and DEI

Citi’s Chief Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
(DEI) Officer and Global Head of Talent
oversees our efforts to promote diversity,
equity and inclusion in the workplace.
Reporting to the Global Head of Human
Resources, the Chief DEI Officer and Global
Head of Talent works in partnership with
senior management, particularly members
of the Executive Management Team, who
co-chair our Affinity groups. Our talent
and DEI efforts are governed by the Citi
Board of Directors.
Ethics and Business

Practices

Ethics and responsible business practices
are among the most material ESG issues
for Citi and our stakeholders. The Ethics,
Conduct and Culture Committee of the
Board oversees management’s efforts
to foster a culture of ethics within the
company and receives regular reports
from senior management on the progress
of those efforts. To learn more about
the responsibilities of the committee,
download the Ethics, Conduct and Culture
Committee Charter. The Ethics and Culture
section of this report also provides more
information about efforts to encourage a
culture of ethics at Citi.
Among its responsibilities, the Board’s Risk
Management Committee reviews Citi’s risk
appetite framework, including reputational
risk appetite, and reviews and approves
key risk policies, including those focused
on environmental and social risk.
Remuneration

The Personnel and Compensation
Committee of the Board holds senior
executives responsible, and in turn senior
executives hold their team members
responsible, for managing our sustainability
and other ESG-related efforts through
incentive compensation decisions. Citi’s
incentive compensation program is discre-
tionary, not formulaic. Management of
sustainability efforts is taken into account
in the program in two ways. First, senior
executives are held accountable for busi-
ness performance through specific metrics
designated on a position-by-position basis.
Progress on our $1 trillion sustainable
finance commitment and milestones for
our net zero plan are incorporated into the
executive scorecards of our CEO, the CEO
of Citi’s Institutional Clients Group and our
Head of Global Public Affairs.
Second, climate change strategy and risk
management performance goals are incor-
porated into annual goals and performance
review processes for a number of our
senior managers and their teams who are
responsible for developing and implement-
ing our approach to climate change. These
managers include the Chief Sustainability
Officer, Head of Environmental and Social
Risk Management (ESRM), Head of Climate
Risk and the Head of Construction and
Sustainability, whose team is responsible
for our environmental footprint goals.
Corporate performance against scorecard
metrics and individual performance
against annual goals are two factors,
among others, that are taken into account
in determining incentive compensation.
Diversity, equity and inclusion, including
representation of women and U.S. Black
colleagues at the Assistant Vice President
to Managing Director levels, continue to
be included in scorecards for our senior
executives. Citi also incorporates share-
holder and stakeholder input on executive
pay into our Compensation Philosophy.

Our Material ESG Issues:

Citi in a Global Context

In 2020, we conducted a

materiality assessment to identify

our most relevant (or “material”)

reporting topics from an ESG

perspective — which is a broader

standard than that used in our

financial disclosures. These topics

are incorporated in the material

issues table on the next page.

Based on internal stakeholder interviews

and external research, the ESG topics

identified, which we refer to as “material

ESG issues” throughout this report, inform
which issues we report on, which issues we
consider raising to our Board of Directors,
and how we establish our ESG priorities.
When taken as a set, the issues that surfaced
in the ESG materiality analysis indicate an
increase in stakeholder expectations, in
particular with regard to issues connected
to climate change and social justice. The
pandemic also placed increased emphasis
on employee health and well-being. Most
of the material ESG issues outlined on the
following pages are not new to Citi nor to
our stakeholders. What is new, however,
is the magnitude and complexity of the
changes required to rise to these challenges.
For example, there is wide recognition that
climate change is happening faster and with
more impact than previously realized; in
parallel, society is reacting to unacceptable
levels of social inequity.
This assessment mirrors — and informs — our
increased strategic efforts on these issues.
It has also driven our increased reporting on
these material topics.

Sustainable
Finance
Contents ESG at Citi Sustainable Finance Sustainable Progress Equitable & Resilient Communities Talent & DEI Risk Management & Responsible Business Appendices

CITI 2021 ESG REPORT 19

We have committed $1 trillion

to sustainable finance by 2030,

a commitment that spans our

business offerings and exemplifies

how environmental and social

finance are integrated across

our businesses. The ambitious

$1 trillion commitment will

support innovation and collective

action toward addressing

the most significant global

challenges that are outlined in

the Paris Agreement and the UN

Sustainable Development Goals

(SDGs).

Announced in April 2021, the $1 trillion

commitment extended our previous

environmental finance goal from $250

billion by 2025 to $500 billion by 2030.

Through this commitment, we will finance

and facilitate a wide array of climate

solutions, such as renewable energy,

clean technology, water conservation and

sustainable transportation. We have also

committed $500 billion toward activities

in social finance, which includes important

investments in education, affordable

housing and basic infrastructure, health-

care, economic inclusion and food security.

Together, these $500 billion targets for

environmental and social finance make

up our $1 trillion commitment, which aims

to further accelerate the transition to a

sustainable, low-carbon economy that

supports society’s environmental, social

and economic needs.

CITI 2021 ESG REPORT 21
We believe that setting ambitious goals

helps to drive innovation and accelerate

progress. Reaching $1 trillion will require

the development of innovative financing

solutions. We will continue to focus on

helping clients across all sectors, no matter

where they are in their own sustainability

journeys, to support their strategic goals

and enable the development and integra-

tion of sustainable business practices.

Over recent years, we have seen the

development of financial products that

were relatively new, or even nonexistent,

when we set our very first $50 billion

climate finance goal in 2007. Thematic

bonds, sustainable supply chain finance and

sustainability-linked bonds and loans that

are tied to ESG performance are contribut-

ing to sustainable finance, and we expect to

see further innovations in the coming years.

Tracking Progress

Each transaction we finance or facilitate

must meet at least one of eight criteria

for environmental finance or one of seven

criteria for social finance to be counted

toward the overall $1 trillion commitment.

These criteria were informed by external

standards and may therefore be subject to

changes as industry guidelines are further

developed.

Credit for each eligible transaction is

counted only once toward the $1 trillion

commitment, even if the transaction meets

multiple criteria. Transactions that meet

both environmental and social criteria

are evenly split between the $500 Billion

Environmental Finance Goal and the $500

Billion Social Finance Goal — without double

counting. Because of the interconnected

nature of sustainable finance, we are

already seeing an increasing number of

transactions with both environmental and

social benefits.

We track our sustainable finance activities
using third-party financial league table
credit, where applicable. The industry
league tables track public financial activ-
ities and rank financial institutions based
on their role (i.e. lead arranger, bookrun-
ner, etc.) in each transaction. For financial
products for which there are no league
tables, we count the amount that reflects
Citi’s financial involvement in the deal.
Beyond counting the financial credit, we
also calculate the estimated environmental
and social impacts associated with a
subset of activities where feasible, such
as avoided greenhouse gas emissions,
renewable energy capacity added, jobs
supported and people impacted. We take
a conservative approach to the estimation
of impacts from the activities we finance
and facilitate — including only deal activity
for which reasonable methodologies
and data sources are available, and
excluding deals for which we have limited
transparency and details. We estimate
that since 2020, approximately 3.9 million
metric tons (mt) of greenhouse gas
emissions have been avoided as a result of
our renewable energy, green affordable
housing and energy efficiency financing
activities. Additionally, we estimate
that our financing activities supported
approximately 1.8 million jobs, affected
26 million people globally and contributed
to approximately $9.5 billion in U.S. GDP.
We consider impact measurement an area
of ongoing education and improvement,
and we will continue to challenge ourselves
in this area.
Sustainable Finance

in Action

The global market for sustainable finance
has been growing rapidly over the last
few years in response to the climate
emergency and COVID-19. Investors and
companies alike recognize the pivotal
role that the financial services sector will
play in facilitating a socially responsible
economic recovery that also accelerates
the transition to a more sustainable,
low-carbon economy.
The volume of sustainable debt issuances,
for example, broke records in 2021,
surpassing $1.6 trillion — more than
double the $762 billion of sustainable
Bloomberg NEF (BNEF), 1H 2022 Sustainable Finance Market Outlook.

debt issuances in 2020, which itself had

set records.^1 The sustainable mergers and

acquisitions deal activity reached

$197 billion in 2021, which was a 60%

increase from 2020 activity.^2

Growth also continues to be seen in the

markets for sustainability-linked financing,

one of the fastest-growing innovations in

sustainable finance. Sustainability-linked

instruments are general corporate purpose

transactions that use key performance

indicators (KPIs) and sustainability targets

to measure a company’s progress, which

result in a reduced financing rate if the

target is met or a penalty if the company

fails to meet the target. With momentum

gained in recent years, the growth of

sustainability-linked financing extended

to the global leveraged finance markets

in 2021;^2 sustainability-linked transaction

volumes increased significantly across

leveraged loan and high-yield bond

issuances, highlighting the popularity of

tying sustainability performance to cost of
financing. This innovation is also expected
to grow in the derivative markets,
with sustainability-linked derivatives.
Acknowledging this momentum in the
market, we count sustainability-linked
instruments toward Citi’s sustainable
finance goal when they incorporate
sustainability key performance indicators
and targets that are aligned with at least
one of the goal criteria.
The growth of sustainable capital markets
has also been driven by corporations,
sovereigns and supranational institutions
focused on achieving their sustainability
commitments, contributing to the SDGs
and aligning with the goals of the Paris
Agreement.
Many of our business units across the
bank contribute to our $1 trillion commit-
ment. There are global industry specialist
teams that focus on different sectors
and industries, such as the recently
formed Natural Resources & Clean Energy
Transition team, which engages with
our clients to support their low-carbon
transition efforts, as well as the Citi Social
Finance team, which partners with busi-
ness units across Citi to help drive inno-
vative efforts on social finance activities
in emerging markets. In many instances,
the deals have integrated and interrelated
environmental and social elements and
impacts. For additional information on new
teams we created or restructured over the
last few years to engage with clients on
their sustainability and transition journeys,
see the Sustainable Progress section.
The following are just some examples
of innovative environmental and social
finance transactions from 2021 that will
be counted toward the overall $1 trillion
commitment.
INCENTIVIZING SUPPLY CHAINS: McCORMICK & COMPANY
Sustainable Agriculture
In 2021, Citi partnered with McCormick & Company, a global leader in flavor, and
the International Finance Corporation (IFC) to provide McCormick’s suppliers
with financial incentives linked to improvements in measures of social and
environmental sustainability. McCormick’s supply chain spans over 3,000
agricultural products sourced from more than 85 countries.
Under the initiative, suppliers can qualify for discounted rates on short-term
working capital financing when they achieve sustainability standards accepted
by McCormick. These standards include performance on labor conditions, health
and safety practices, crop management, environmental impact, farmer resilience
and women’s empowerment. The partnership included an advisory component
in Vietnam, where IFC is helping McCormick build a more sustainable, traceable,
certified and quality-compliant pepper supply chain through capacity development
and the empowerment of women farmers.

LINKING LOANS TO SUSTAINABILITY METRICS
Diversity & Equity
The investment firm BlackRock has been a vocal leader in encouraging companies
to set and meet environmental and social sustainability goals. In 2021, BlackRock
amended its $4.4 billion revolving credit agreement to incorporate certain
sustainability-linked metrics.
Citi acted as joint lead arranger and co-sustainability structuring agent for the
5-year sustainability-linked loan that ties BlackRock’s borrowing costs to its ability
to achieve certain targets for increased representation of women in leadership and
higher representation of Black and Latinx employees in its U.S. workforce, as well
as increasing sustainable assets under management. Pursuant to the terms of the
credit agreement, BlackRock’s applicable borrowing costs are subject to upward or
downward adjustments on an annual basis if BlackRock achieves, or fails to achieve,
certain specified targets. The facility reinforces BlackRock’s commitment and
accountability to achieving certain sustainability goals by integrating a component
of financial alignment through its liquidity management strategy.
EXPANDING ACCESS TO RELIABLE ENERGY IN KENYA
Renewable Energy and Affordable Basic Infrastructure
Off-grid solar home systems are a vital way to expand access to reliable energy.
Citi was the sole coordinator on a $75 million transaction to expand access to off-grid
solar energy in Kenya. The financing will support Greenlight Planet’s ambitions to
reach an additional 10 million households in low-income, off-grid communities over
the next five years.
Greenlight Planet Kenya is a group company of Greenlight Planet Inc., a leading
designer, distributor and financier of rooftop solar home systems for off-grid and
weak-grid homes. Through its network of 200 branches and 8,000 field agents,
Greenlight sells its Sun King-branded solar energy systems directly to its off-grid
residential clients and provides “pay-as-you-go” financing to facilitate their purchase.
To date, the company’s Sun King products have saved customers more than
$4 billion cumulatively, which would otherwise be used to purchase CO 2 -emitting
kerosene lanterns and to charge mobile phones.
EXPANDING ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA
Healthcare
mPharma is working to expand access to healthcare across low-income communities in
sub-Saharan Africa. By optimizing supply chains and increasing efficiencies, mPharma
is able to bring high-quality, affordable medicines to communities most in need — the
so-called “last mile” of distribution for pharmaceuticals and vaccines. mPharma also
provides financing solutions for mom-and-pop pharmacies, clinics and patients in
underserved areas such as Ghana, Nigeria, Zambia and Kenya.
Thanks to a line of credit from Citi under Scaling Enterprise, a partnership with the
U.S. DFC and the Ford Foundation, mPharma will be able to serve more than 2 million
patients in the countries where it operates. Health clinics that operate with mPharma
report a decrease of up to 25% in medical-related complications.

SUPPORTING COVID-19 RESILIENCE THROUGH UNICEF
Healthcare
The global pandemic has exacerbated poverty rates and global inequality, affecting
millions of children worldwide. The World Bank and the United Nations Children’s
Fund (UNICEF) were looking for new ways to accelerate funding to meet the
increasingly urgent needs for their joint pandemic relief programs.
Citi acted as sole structure and arranger for a first-of-its kind $100 million bond
transaction from the World Bank’s International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, which allowed UNICEF to access capital markets funding to support
its private sector fundraising activities. The bond gave institutional and high net
worth investors an opportunity to support UNICEF’s work with children, including
COVID-19 resilience programs around the world. The cash flows on the bond are
linked to future donations to UNICEF.
The bond proceeds will support two programs: $50 million will be used by the
World Bank to finance its sustainable development programs, including projects
targeting the health and socioeconomic impacts of COVID-19; the other $50 million
will be allocated to UNICEF to expand programs in 18 countries, targeting future
funding of up to $450 million.
EMPOWERING WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS IN MEXICO
Economic Inclusion and Diversity & Equity
Women represent one-third of entrepreneurs in Mexico, yet they typically have
few opportunities to access financial investments for their businesses. In 2021,
Citi partnered with the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC)
and Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) to provide $70 million to
Banco Compartamos, the largest microfinance institution in Mexico.
Compartamos, which translates to “let’s share” in Spanish, is using the funding to
support and empower more than 135,000 small businesses, approximately 90%
of them women-owned. A portion of the loans is dedicated to the less developed
regions of the country, including Chiapas, Oaxaca, Guerrero and Puebla. Learn
more in this video.
DEVELOPING MORE SUSTAINABLE RAIL LINES
Sustainable Transportation
The development of a 25-kilometer monorail line is one of the largest construction
projects in Panama since the expansion of the Panama Canal. Citi acted as sole
global coordinator and mandated lead arranger for $2 billion in green loans for
the Panama Metro project on behalf of a consortium of Korean companies led by
Hyundai Engineering & Construction.
The elevated train line will have initial capacity to transport 18,000 passengers
per hour in each direction, with an ultimate goal of more than 30,000 passengers
per hour in each direction. The monorail will incorporate Hitachi’s B-CHOP system,
which harnesses the train’s regenerative energy to substantially reduce energy
consumption while the train is in braking mode. The system is expected to cut
back 20,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually while providing energy for
future use.

STRUCTURING A GREEN HYBRID BOND
Clean Technology
Citi helped German chemicals company Evonik Industries, one of the world leaders
in specialty chemicals, issue a €500 million green hybrid bond in 2021 — acting as
sole green structuring advisor, joint structuring agent, joint global coordinator and
joint bookrunner on the transaction.
The corporate hybrid bond structure can be attractive to issuers, particularly in
Europe, that are looking for a stronger credit profile or financial flexibility. The
green issuance followed the publication of Evonik’s Green Finance Framework, which
integrates sustainability into the company’s financial strategy. Under the framework,
proceeds from green financing instruments may be used for eligible projects in the
areas of eco-efficient products, energy efficiency and renewable energy.
Proceeds of this green hybrid bond issuance will primarily be used to finance
investments in Evonik’s Next Generation Solutions — products and solutions
with sustainability benefits that Evonik expects to grow significantly in the
coming years.
FINANCING RENEWABLE ENERGY WHILE INCREASING DIVERSITY
Renewable Energy and Diversity & Equity
In November, Citi provided AES’ Clean Energy business, a leading renewables
development platform in the United States, with financing to fund the construction
and operation of the Skipjack Solar Project outside Richmond, Virginia. The project
is expected to provide 225 megawatts-DC (175 megawatts-AC) of renewable energy
capacity; once online, the project will sell 100% of its solar energy output under a
14-year, fixed-price agreement to one of the largest power generator companies in
the U.S.
The transaction also included a milestone: Citi’s first execution of a sustainability-
linked derivative for a construction project — a KPI-linked interest rate swap to
support the financing of the project. Under the terms, AES commits to achieving
key performance indicators linked to increasing gender diversity measured by
employees who self-identify as female or nonbinary employees and increasing new
hire employees who self-identify as members of an underrepresented group.
Citi acted as coordinating lead arranger, lender, and swap syndication arranger on
this transaction, providing a comprehensive financing package for AES, a company
that is focused on accelerating the future of energy, together.

The reporting on our progress toward our $1 trillion commitment in sustainable finance by 2030 includes measuring the en-

vironmental and social impacts associated with contributing sustainable finance projects. Where feasible, we have estimated

the impacts representative of Citi’s financing and facilitation activities. Our impact measurement methodologies align with our

accounting approach, reporting our share of the impacts proportional to our financial share of the transaction.

Impact Calculation Methodology Summary

Citi initiatives help to create measurable impacts for communities across the world. To estimate the environmental and social

impacts of Citi-financed projects and activities we looked at the following metrics:

- Avoided GHG emissions refers to the amount of GHG emissions avoided because of Citi’s share of financing for renewable
energy, green affordable housing and energy efficiency projects. GHG emissions avoidance is calculated by applying regional
electric grid factors to Citi’s share of financing across three types of activities, including a low-carbon source replacing energy
use from the grid, energy efficiency upgrades and green housing units that are LEED-certified. Impacts reflect the per annum
benefit as opposed to benefit over entire project life.
- For renewable energy projects, total project capacity for energy is calculated as the annual capacity factor applied to
the total project size per annum and multiplied by the CO 2 emissions factor.
- For energy efficiency upgrades, the average household energy savings is calculated as the average household energy
use multiplied by the percentage of energy savings per thousand U.S. dollars invested. The result is multiplied by the
total warehouse value and the CO 2 emissions factor.

Contents ESG at Citi Sustainable Finance Sustainable Progress Equitable & Resilient Communities Talent & DEI Risk Management & Responsible Business Appendices

CITI 2021 ESG REPORT 28

For green buildings, the average household energy savings is equal to the average energy use of a non-LEED-certified
building multiplied by the percentage of energy savings by a LEED-certified building. The result is multiplied by the number
of square feet and the per square feet CO 2 emission factor.
- Renewable energy capacity added refers to the size of new renewable energy capacity installed as a result of Citi’s share of
renewable energy project financings.
- People impacted refers to the direct number of people benefiting from the use of Citi-financed lending activities for small
businesses, renewable energy and energy efficiency projects, affordable housing, and underwritten municipal bond proceeds for
transit, water and education projects.
For microfinance lending activities, people impacted is equivalent to the number of entrepreneurs and small farm holders
receiving business loans as self-reported by Citi teams.
For renewable energy projects and energy efficiency finance, people impacted is equivalent to the number of people whose
annual energy usage is supplied by the project. Estimated renewable energy generation annually due to Citi financing is
divided by average energy consumption per capita in the country of the project to estimate number of people impacted.
For affordable housing, the number of people impacted is calculated using external reference data on average household
size multiplied by the number of housing units constructed.
For municipal bond financing related to education projects, people impacted is estimated as the number of enrolled school
children benefiting from new or repaired school buildings or purchases of equipment. External education data on average
student enrollment by school, and the number of schools benefiting from funding as stated in issuance documents, was
used for this calculation.
- Direct jobs supported refers to the number of jobs supported by the uses of Citi-financed lending or underwritten municipal
bond proceeds. Jobs supported are related to Citi’s share of new financing for the projects. For microfinance lending, jobs
supported are equal to the number of entrepreneurs and smallholder farmers that received loans. For projects involving new
construction or maintenance and repair of affordable housing units, renewable energy generation, schools, transit or water
systems in the United States, jobs supported are calculated as Citi-financed expenditures divided by output per worker supplied
by the IMPLAN economic modeling system. For projects involving renewable energy generation in locations outside the United
States, external data is used to estimate the share of project cost involving installation (labor), and this is divided by average
compensation of workers in the country to estimate jobs supported.

CITI 2021 ESG REPORT 30

The climate crisis has created not just an

opportunity to lead — but an opportunity

to partner: working with our clients to

decarbonize their businesses as part of

our journey to net zero.

The science is clear, as is the need to move

urgently toward a low-carbon economy.

The financial sector has a critical role

to play in supporting other industries

to reduce their environmental impacts

and transition their business models in

line with what is needed to keep global

warming to 1.5°C.

Our Sustainable Progress Strategy builds

on our decades-long track record in

sustainability and environmental finance.
To drive the transition to a low-carbon
economy, we are drawing on our expertise,
expanding our business unit capabilities
and deepening our engagement with
the carbon-intensive sectors that are of
highest priority for transformation.
The strategy, which is integrated into
our Environmental and Social Policy
Framework, focuses on three areas:
financing the low-carbon transition,
deepening climate risk assessment
and disclosure, and reducing the
environmental impacts of our own
operations. The environmental finance
transactions that count toward our
$1 trillion commitment to sustainable
finance, which also includes a commitment
to social finance, illustrate how Citi is
contributing to the low-carbon transition.
One year after setting our Sustainable
Progress Strategy, we took an important
next step on the path toward a low-carbon
future, pledging to achieve net zero
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for our
financing (by 2050) and for our operations
(by 2030).

Financing the Low-Carbon Transition

One of the core elements of our

Sustainable Progress Strategy is

our commitment to finance and

facilitate activities that accelerate

the transition to a low-carbon

economy. We doubled our previous

commitment of $250 billion

by 2025 and set an ambitious

$1 trillion sustainable finance

commitment by 2030 — half for

environmental finance and half

for social finance.

But it’s not just about financing and

facilitating transactions. Working collabo-

ratively with our clients in decarbonizing

and helping them in their transitions is

a central focus of our net zero plan. We

believe systemic collaboration is essential

for the global economy to reach net

zero emissions. We are already engaging

with numerous clients with respect to

their climate exposure profile. We intend

to deepen our engagement with them

to understand their transition plans in

greater detail as those plans evolve and

help them in their strategies to realize

opportunities inherent in transitioning to a

low-carbon world.

Transforming Our

Business to Support a

Low-Carbon Economy

Climate change has become a C-suite

issue for clients in all sectors of the global

economy, in terms of growth opportunities

and risk management, and ESG consider-

ations are increasingly part of our business

conversations. To support client needs,

we have expanded our client engagement

offerings across our business to offer

strategic sustainability and ESG services

and solutions.

Our business groups are focused on
helping clients in all sectors, no matter
where they are in their own sustainability
journeys. We offer customized products
and services to support clients in their
transition to more sustainable business
models and practices that will advance
progress toward a low-carbon future.
Within Banking, Capital Markets and
Advisory (BCMA) , sustainability and ESG
is being integrated into our businesses
and client engagements. We engage with
C-suite executives, boards of directors
and treasury teams on strategic financing
using a sustainability lens, providing
insights about industry transformations,
trends and sustainability risks and
opportunities.
In early 2021, we created the Natural
Resources & Clean Energy Transition
(NRCET) team to drive client engagement
efforts in the Energy, Power and Chemicals
sectors. This team unites seasoned corpo-
rate and investment bankers with deep
knowledge of these sectors under a single
umbrella to assist our clients with the net

CITI 2021 ESG REPORT 33

zero transition. Our Sustainability and

Corporate Transitions (SCT) team, founded

in 2020, also engages with clients at the

C-suite and senior levels across sectors

to support the transition of their business

models to a sustainable and low-carbon

future, helping them identify their ESG

challenges and opportunities to shape

their strategy.

In 2021, Citi served as the exclusive

financial advisor to South Korean

conglomerate SK Holdings in a transaction

noted as the largest investment ever in

the hydrogen fuel cell space. The $1.6

billion deal gave SK Group a 9.9% stake

in Plug Power Inc., a leading provider of

hydrogen fuel cell and green hydrogen

generation systems in North America. The

two companies entered into a strategic

partnership to provide hydrogen fuel cell

systems, hydrogen fueling stations and

electrolyzers to the Korean and broader

Asian markets in order to accelerate

hydrogen as an alternative clean energy

source throughout Asia.

South Korea is one of the most important

and developed markets for hydrogen.

The government has set a roadmap with
ambitious goals to build a hydrogen-based
economy by 2040.
Also in BCMA, our Sustainable Debt
Capital Markets (Sustainable DCM)
team has technical expertise on green,
social and sustainability bonds as well
as sustainability-linked bonds (SLB), and
works within debt capital markets and with
industry bankers to originate and structure
issuances for these types of bonds on
behalf of clients around the world. The
Sustainable DCM team also advises Citi
Treasury on Citi’s own sustainable debt
issuance programs.
The Sustainable DCM team has helped
numerous clients globally structure
innovative sustainability-linked bonds
(SLB) tied to sustainability goals. Such
bonds are an example of KPI-linked
instruments that commit the issuer
or borrower to specific sustainability
objectives, such as greenhouse gas
(GHG) emissions reduction or other key
performance indicators (KPIs).
Citi acted as SLB Structuring Advisor and
Active Bookrunner on Johnson Controls
International (JCI)’s inaugural $500 million
SLB in September 2021. As part of this
transaction, JCI committed to (i) reduce
absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions
by 35% and (ii) reduce absolute Scope
3 GHG emissions from the use of sold
products by 5%, all by 2025 from a 2017
baseline, supporting JCI’s long-term net
zero emissions by 2040 target. Failure to
achieve these targets will result in a 25
basis point coupon step-up. JCI was also
the first S&P 500 company to publish an
integrated sustainable finance framework
encompassing both use-of-proceeds
bonds (green, social or sustainability)
and sustainability-linked bonds, allowing
JCI to issue any/all sustainable financing
instruments.
In another first, Citi client Tesco became
the first UK corporate and the first
retailer globally to launch a SLB tied
to ambitious GHG emissions reduction
targets in January 2021. As the largest
retailer in the United Kingdom, Tesco
PLC has the ability to make a significant
impact on the path to a low-carbon future.
Tesco is aiming to become carbon neutral
across its own operations by 2035 and

net zero across the value chain by 2050.

Citi acted as structuring advisor and

active bookrunner on the €750 million

SLB. As part of this bond issuance, Tesco

agreed to cut its Scope 1 and 2 GHG emis-

sions by 60% by 2025, relative to a 2015

baseline. Failure to achieve this target in

Tesco’s 2025 financial year will result in

a 25 basis point step-up in the coupon in

2027, 2028 and 2029, reinforcing Tesco’s

climate commitments to both external and

internal stakeholders.

Also in 2021, Citi served as sole

structuring advisor and lead left

bookrunner for a $2.8 billion green bond

offering for Ardagh Metal Packaging, a

global leader in sustainable aluminum

packaging solutions. The offering was

the largest-ever high-yield green bond

completed to date. Ardagh has published a

Green Financing Framework that provides

details on the eligible use of proceeds.

In our Global Markets business, we

recently established a dedicated ESG team

to support our client engagement through

the integration of strategic sustainability

and ESG services and solutions. Global

Markets provides clients with ESG thought

leadership about trends, market evolution,

themes, integration and data-driven anal-

ysis. We aim to lead our clients through

the rapidly evolving landscape of ESG by

partnering with clients to develop new

solutions across fixed-income, securitized

products, multi-asset strategies and

sustainable real assets, in addition to

our full range of solutions in equities.

Using our strengths in primary issuance

and secondary trading, we support the

development of deep, liquid and efficient

sustainable markets. Citi is also able to

address origination and financing gaps for

clean energy and energy-efficiency project

developers and investors by working

across banking, advisory, origination and

markets teams for optimal client solutions.

Our Clean Energy Finance group, for
example, has expertise in providing
full-service financing solutions for a broad
spectrum of renewable energy technolo-
gies, serving as a one-stop shop for our
clients, as well as financing to help clients
implement energy efficiency projects.
Citi Global Wealth , through its Investing
with Purpose approach, offers managed
opportunities, alternative investments
and tailored exposure to capital markets
to help clients pursue their sustainable
investment objectives. As clients have
been increasingly concerned with the
impact their investments may have on
society and the environment, the direction
of sustainable investing is evolving past
socially responsible investing, and Citi
Global Wealth has updated its offerings to
meet this growing area of client demand.
The Investing with Purpose platform
provides opportunities for private clients
to invest alongside Citi’s institutional
clients. Multiple Citi Global Wealth clients
have participated in differentiated capital
markets solutions supporting the global
green energy transition, an investment
thesis reaffirmed by our investment
strategy team. As the world goes greener,
the opportunities for Citi Global Wealth
investors are likely to multiply over the
coming years, enabling us to build entire
core and opportunistic allocations that
reflect sustainable principles — a process
we might describe as “greening your
portfolio.”
Our Treasury and Trade Solutions (TTS)
business provides financing and cash
management solutions to clients across
the globe.
We have established a global, cross-func-
tional ESG working group to develop holis-
tic sustainable working capital, investment

include, but are not limited to, Sustainable
Supply Chain Finance, Sustainable Trade
and Working Capital Loans and Sustainable

Climate and Biodiversity

We are continuing to learn about the complex dynamics between climate and
biodiversity. These two topics are deeply interconnected, and there is an
increasing awareness that climate change, along with other human-caused
stresses on natural systems, is contributing to biodiversity loss and ongoing
extinction events.* “Natural capital” is a way to conceptualize the various
resources and services that are provided by resilient ecosystems. This concept
helps to inform the increasing focus on biodiversity, its impact on climate and the
importance of disclosure.
A recent Citi Global Perspectives & Solutions (GPS) report: Biodiversity: The
Ecosystem at the Heart of Business explores why businesses and investors should
care about biodiversity loss. The report explains that businesses rely on nature
for their products and ecosystem services such as clean air, water, pollination
and carbon sequestration. At the same time, their operations create direct
and indirect impacts on nature that can, and often do, negatively affect their
business. By failing to understand the dependencies and impacts on nature and
biodiversity, companies open themselves up to biodiversity risk that could affect
the profitability of their businesses. This in turn poses risks to their investors.
There is a growing realization that we are losing biodiversity at an alarming rate.
This requires urgent action that is complementary to climate action. Global wildlife
populations have fallen an average of 68% in just 46 years,** and human activities
threaten 1 million animal and plant species with extinction.*** At the same time,
there is a financing gap of $598 billion to $824 billion per year† for broad action on
biodiversity, suggesting significant business opportunities. Additionally, nature-
positive solutions can create $10 trillion in business opportunities and 395 million
new jobs by 2030.††^ These solutions could deliver up to 37% of CO 2 emission
reductions by 2030.†††
To support our understanding and action on biodiversity, we are also a member of
the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) Forum, a global and
multidisciplinary consultative network of institutional supporters who share the
vision and mission of the TNFD. (To learn more, see the Risk Management section).

we enhance our clients’ ability to access

capital in higher risk markets by delivering

financial solutions in partnership with

Development Finance Intuitions, Export

Credit Agencies and Multilateral Agencies

designed to improve risk capacity. Read

Banco Compartamos project.

In November, we launched our first

Sustainable Supply Chain Finance (SSCF)

program in Asia Pacific with the aim of

supporting clients as they advance their

ESG priorities, improve the resilience of

their supply chains and manage working

capital needs. The program was imple-

mented for Henkel, the German chemical

and consumer goods company, and is

targeted at existing or new suppliers

that demonstrate strong or improving

sustainability performance. Qualifying

suppliers can access Citi’s supply chain

financing at preferential rates on a tiered

basis, with rates improving as a supplier’s

sustainability score improves. Henkel, with

the support of a global leading sustain-

ability assessment agency, will assess the

sustainability performance of suppliers.

TTS’s Liquidity Management Services

support treasuries’ goals with various

cash investment products that have incor-

porated sustainability principles. Clients

can invest their excess cash with Money

Market Funds that have incorporated ESG

principles. In December, we expanded our

innovative Green Minimum Maturity Time

Deposit, a sustainable cash investment

product that gives clients the ability to

invest their short-term liquidity in environ-

mentally friendly projects. Investments

in Citi’s green deposits or new Green

Minimum Time Deposits will be allocated

to finance or refinance a portfolio of green

projects that meet the rigorous environ-

mental finance eligibility criteria defined

in our Green Bond Framework. The new

product also gives clients greater flexibility

to extend the investment period.

Climate

Risk and

Net Zero

When we consider the risks

related to climate change, we

apply a double materiality

perspective, looking at both the

impact of climate change on

our business and our business’s

impact on the climate.

Citi’s business is exposed to numerous

climate risks given our role as one of the

largest financiers of the global economy,

including carbon-intensive industries. This

means that as we address and mitigate

risks, we must take into account how we will

protect and strengthen our business while

ensuring that our clients become part of

the solutions that are needed to transition

to a low-carbon economy.

We prioritize regular reporting about

our progress and approach in relation to

climate risk, as we believe transparently

sharing our journey is an important

contribution we can make both to the

broader industry and to our clients. Citi

has disclosed climate-related metrics and

targets for our environmental finance

activities and our operations for well over

a decade, and we released our first Climate

Change Position Statement in 2007. Since

then, our commitment to this issue has

only grown, as evidenced by our strategic

approach, alignment with global stan-

dards and the continued evolution of our

Environmental and Social Risk Management

(ESRM) Policy in response to the changing

risk landscape.

First established in 2003, our ESRM Policy
applies to all Citi entities globally and
provides a framework for how we identify,
mitigate and manage the potential risk
to Citi associated with the environmental
and social risks of our clients’ activities. It
guides our financing decisions for compa-
nies and projects within environmentally
sensitive and/or high-carbon sectors. It also
provides us with opportunities to advise
our clients on climate-related risks. To learn
more about our ESRM Policy and related
due diligence, see the Environmental and
Social Risk Management section.
In addition to establishing internal poli-
cies and practices, we also align with
external standards to strengthen our
processes, reporting and engagement.
We have supported the recommendations
of the Task Force on Climate-related
Financial Disclosures (TCFD) since they
were released in 2017. Our objective is to
understand the potential financial risks
from climate change to Citi, our clients
and communities; how Citi and our clients
may be contributing to climate change; and
how we can help our clients transition to a
low-carbon economy.
Find out more about our implementation
of the TCFD recommendations in our 2021
TCFD Report. In addition, this ESG Report
includes a TCFD index indicating where
climate-related content in response to TCFD
recommendations can be found throughout
this report and other public documentation.

CITI 2021 ESG REPORT 37

Our Net Zero

Commitment

In 2021, we announced our commitment

to net zero greenhouse gas (GHG)

emissions by 2050, in alignment with

the objectives of the Paris Agreement

and prevailing climate science. Reducing

Scope 3 financed emissions^1 is widely

recognized as the most significant

contribution the financial industry can

have to achieving a low-carbon economy.

Our commitment will include interim

financed emissions reduction targets for

carbon-intensive sectors, as described by

the UN Environment Programme Finance

Initiative (UNEP FI) Guidelines for Climate

Target Setting for Banks. To date, we have

set 2030 emissions targets for our Energy

and Power loan portfolios.

For our own operations, we are targeting

net zero GHG emissions by 2030, which

builds on our environmental footprint

goals and the 100% renewable electricity

goal that we achieved in 2020. (Learn

more in the Sustainable Operations

section.)

The approach and activities related to our

net zero commitment are distinct from our

management of climate risk for our firm.

While our net zero commitment is keenly

focused on Citi’s impacts on the climate

and reducing GHG emissions to net zero

across our value chain, our climate risk

management efforts are focused on Citi’s

safety and soundness, and thus on the

integration of climate risk into our risk

management governance, processes and

strategies. Although these two priorities

differ in their primary focus, they are

related to and reinforce each other, leading

to mutual benefits. As we execute on

our net zero commitment, the resulting
reduction in financed emissions will help to
reduce our climate transition risk.
Citi’s net zero ambition builds on our
commitment to the UNEP FI Principles for
Responsible Banking, our leadership in
climate disclosure in alignment with the
TCFD and our ESRM Policy — specifically
our Sector Approaches related to fossil
fuels. Transparency and accountability are
keys to success, and we will report annu-
ally on our net zero progress.
Our commitment to net zero is significant,
given the size and breadth of our
portfolios and businesses. To achieve it,
we must meet our clients where they are
in their sustainability journeys and help
accelerate their progress in this area. We
will work with all our clients, including our
fossil fuel clients, to develop credible plans
that include the responsible retirement of
carbon-intensive assets as we transition
to net zero together. We will prioritize
partnering with clients on transition
strategies, and exiting client relationships
is a last resort.
Banks are facing growing pressure to
divest from fossil fuels. In some instances,
such as thermal coal mining, where there
is credit risk from stranded assets in
addition to climate risk, we have already
established a transparent time frame for
our transition expectations. However,
we are cognizant that large-scale, rapid
divestment could result in an abrupt and
disorderly transition to a low-carbon
economy, creating both economic and
social upheaval on a global scale. For
example, certain carbon-intensive compa-
nies may play critical roles in channeling
the necessary capital expenditures and
providing the raw materials to support
new climate technologies or may provide
necessary baseload power for developing
countries.
An orderly, responsible and equitable
transition, which accounts for the imme-
diate economic needs of communities and
workers as well as environmental justice
and broader economic development
concerns, is essential to retaining polit-
ical and social support for the shift to a
low-carbon economy. Under the goals of
our net zero plan, we seek to balance these
needs to facilitate this complex transition.
Initial Net Zero Plan

We released our initial net zero plans for
our Energy and Power loan portfolios in
our 2021 TCFD Report. The plans for these
portfolios build upon the calculation of
our financed emissions and the setting of
interim 2030 emissions reduction targets
for these sectors. Our net zero plan
incorporates a twofold approach: assess-
ment of our clients’ climate profiles and
engagement to understand their transition
opportunities. Additionally, we will employ
a number of tools, phased in over time,
to help move these portfolios toward our
2030 targets. Underlying the implementa-
tion of this plan is Citi’s continued effort to
expand our climate-related resources and
engage directly with our clients.
Financed emissions are the GHG emissions generated by the operations and entities that financial institutions lend money to or invest in.

GHG Emissions Public Disclosure
Review public disclosures such as sustainability reports
or submissions to the CDP Climate Change Questionnaire
and supplement with direct engagement with clients
GHG Emissions Reduction Targets
Review public statements on net zero/decarbonization
commitments or alignment with external initiatives such
as the Science Based Targets initiative. For the Energy
sector, assess targets for GHGs such as methane
Decarbonization/Transition Plan
Understand clients’ climate transition plans. Determine
the tools that clients will employ, including capital
allocation, product diversification and linkages to
executive compensation
Climate Risk Scoring
Harness public discourse and statements and third-party
data as well as our ongoing client engagement, to develop
an internal assessment for both transition and physical risk
Client Asset Evaluation
Where available, review asset-level data for further
assessments of climate risk and emissions intensity;
this is particularly applicable to project finance
External Climate Scores
Reference third-party ratings systems for additional
data on climate-related performance

Additionally, we will review public disclosures, climate governance and the commit-

ments and actions they have taken to date. We anticipate that this initial review phase

will continue through the end of 2023. In the following table, we highlight some of the

key considerations that will frame client engagement.

While our transition plans for each loan portfolio will be based on a rigorous net zero methodology, we are still in the early stages

of plotting our net zero journey. We expect to modify our transition plans and targets as both the availability and quality of data

improve and as climate scenarios are updated. We also recognize that there will be uneven year-on-year progress toward our 2030

targets, because clients and sectors differ in their capacity to transition and in the time frames in which their carbon reduction

investments will be realized.

Achieving Our Targets

We will use a variety of approaches, many of which will run concurrently, to reach our financed emissions reduction

targets for our Energy and Power loan portfolios. For further detail on these five areas of activity, refer to our 2021

TCFD Report.

Client Transition Assessment, Advisory and Finance

- Client engagement and assessment
- Transition advisory and finance, including debt and equity underwriting and lending
- Support existing and new clean technologies to accelerate commercialization
- Support enabling public policy and regulation in the United States and other countries, including through
trade associations and other industry groups
- Dimension climate risk exposure across our lending portfolios and review client carbon reduction progress
- Ongoing review and refinement of ESRM Policy
- Active portfolio management to align with net zero targets, including considerations of transition measures
taken by clients

The PCAF methodology is primarily focused on reporting financed emissions on an annual basis and relies on data of funds outstand-

ing, not the total funds that a financial institution may have committed to the client in the reporting year. While we intend to continue

disclosing per the PCAF requirements to provide this annual view of financed emissions associated with our activities, we are using

“committed funds” data to more holistically attribute our clients’ emissions for the baseline financed emissions figures in our net zero

plan. Consequently, we undertook an additional analysis of our Energy and Power loan portfolios using total committed funds to calcu-

late baseline emissions from 2020 and establish 2030 emission targets. The use of committed funds in this context provides a more

accurate reflection of the maximum emissions-generating activity that Citi has agreed to finance and is therefore better suited for the

purposes of forward-looking emissions management and target setting. This approach results in discrepancies between the metrics we

report for PCAF and for our net zero targets, but we believe the committed funds approach is better aligned with the way we expect to

manage our net zero targets.

To reach net zero, we must move from our baseline across a decarbonization pathway to our ultimate net zero target. Establishing 2030

targets are the first step in that journey. The next step is to develop an implementation plan to achieve targeted reductions in each

relevant sector. We are evaluating a number of strategies and tools to drive towards the established goals, though they may not all be

applicable for every sector or client. Some of the emissions reduction approaches and potential future tools include client engagement,

capital allocation strategy and portfolio management tools.

The table on the following page summarizes our current 2030 emission targets for Citi’s Energy and Power portfolios. These interim

2030 targets are a key component of our net zero plan for emissions in our client portfolio.

Energy and Power Baseline Emissions and Interim Targets

During 2021, we used the PCAF methodology to conduct an analysis of our Energy and Power portfolios using 2020 data. In alignment

with PCAF requirements, this analysis is based on funds outstanding (drawn and not yet repaid) by clients during the year to provide a

view of financed emissions associated with our activities during that year.

Real Estate sectors for core analysis and

target setting, in alignment with the NZBA

guidelines. We will consider the remaining

sectors, including Aluminum, Aviation,

Cement and Agricultural subsectors in 2023

and 2024.

Citi’s Approach to

Managing Climate Risk

Citi’s Risk Management function is

responsible for identifying, measuring,

managing, controlling and reporting risks

to the company. We identify climate risk

as an “emerging risk” in Citi’s Enterprise

Risk Management Framework. Within the

framework, emerging risks are those that

are new or rapidly changing, with high

growth potential, and are characterized by

data unavailability or other uncertainties.

We do not view climate risk as a stand-alone

risk category but as a transversal risk,

capable of manifesting across each of Citi’s

seven risk categories in our risk taxonomy:

Credit, Market, Liquidity, Strategic,
Operational, Compliance and Reputation.
Climate impacts may be either physical- or
transition-related and may vary depending
on the time horizon.
During 2021, we strengthened our gover-
nance and deepened our expertise to
advance effective management of climate
risks and opportunities. Highlights include
the following:
- Formation of a new Global ESG Council,
consisting of senior members of manage-
ment, with the aim of providing enhanced
oversight of our ESG activities and goals
- Creation of the Natural Resources &
Clean Energy Transition team to inte-
grate our Energy, Power and Chemicals
businesses, in order to assist our clients
across these sectors as they transition
- Growth of our dedicated Climate Risk
team, with an emphasis on expertise
in credit risk, scenario analysis, stress
testing and regulatory engagement
- Establishment of a Net Zero Task Force to
support the development and launch of
our net zero plan

Regulatory Compliance

Interest in climate risk management from
regulators continues to grow globally.
We are monitoring and responding to
emerging regulatory obligations and
engaging with regulators around the world
about climate risk issues, especially related
to risk management, strategy and scenario
analysis requirements.
As we anticipate an increase in regulatory
requirements, voluntary frameworks and
mandated product classifications, we are
strengthening our internal regulatory teams
with subject matter experts. We are also
improving our access to relevant, accurate
data to sharpen our scenario analyses and
building a standardized, global climate
disclosure strategy that can monitor and
manage requirements and provide consis-
tent reporting across our operations.

EMPLOYEE TRAINING IN CLIMATE RISK

We are working to create a culture of sustainability across our company and raise our colleagues’ literacy related to
climate risk. In 2021, we created a new training module that covers key climate risk concepts, including the definition of
climate risk, emerging climate risk standards, supervisory expectations, an overview of Citi’s efforts in this area and our
initiatives to enhance climate risk management. Our previous climate risk trainings were customized for specific groups
of employees to raise awareness about particular climate-related topics. This new module is our first training for climate
that allows us to provide consistent instruction for a broader audience and further support the integration of climate risk
considerations into our risk management processes.
Climate Risk in Our Maritime Shipping Portfolio

The Poseidon Principles, released in 2019, provide a framework for lenders, lessors and financial guarantors to integrate climate
considerations into lending decisions with international shipping clients, to help the sector decarbonize in line with the goals
of the International Maritime Organization (IMO). Citi was a founding signatory and also chairs the Steering Committee of the
Poseidon Principles Association, the governing body of the Poseidon Principles.
As a part of our commitment, we provide yearly disclosures, which are published alongside those of other signatories in an annual
report published on the Poseidon Principles website. Our most recent disclosure reflects updated data from the IMO’s Fourth GHG
Study, published in 2020, as well as an improved methodology for estimating carbon emissions and carbon intensity for a variety
of vessel types and sizes, resulting in a more accurate representation of vessel emissions and the emissions reduction targets
needed for the world’s shipping fleet.
Our reported alignment score this year (+11.7%) is notably further out of alignment compared with our reported score of last year
(+6%). This change in alignment is due to a combination of factors, including the improved accuracy of the new methodology,
as well as significant disruptions in shipping related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The disruptions were most notable in the Cruise
segment, which saw dramatic decreases in efficiency (and therefore our alignment scores) driven by reduced cruising activity
globally. This was however offset by the improvements in the accuracy of the methodology, resulting in an alignment score of
+1.1% for the Cargo segment of Citi’s Shipping portfolio only (excluding the Cruise segment). Further changes to the methodology
may occur as data and industry practices evolve, and new IMO regulations come into effect.
To further advance progress in the maritime shipping industry, we are a member of the Getting to Zero Coalition, which is focused
on the development of commercially viable, zero-emission vessels and other needed maritime infrastructure for scalable net
zero-carbon energy sources, including production, distribution, storage and bunkering. The coalition was founded by the Global
Maritime Forum, Friends of Ocean Action and the World Economic Forum. It has more than 190 member companies and nine
knowledge partners and is supported by key intergovernmental organizations and governments.

Reducing Climate

Risk in Our Financing

Climate risk is one of the three pillars of

our Sustainable Progress Strategy. When

it comes to analyzing and reducing climate

risk associated with our clients, we have

identified the following three primary

focus areas:

- Policy development
- Portfolio analysis and measurement
- Engagement

Policy Development

As part of our work to integrate climate

risk into Citi’s risk policies and governance

frameworks, we have updated our ESRM

Policy Sector Approaches for carbon-

intensive sectors to incorporate emerging

best practices. One area where we have

made significant progress is in our fossil

fuel Sector Approaches for thermal coal

mining and the generation of coal-fired

power, which predated our net zero

commitment. See the box on the right for

more details on our targets and policy.

Portfolio Analysis

and Measurement

Citi aims to understand the transition and

physical risks that Citi and our clients are

exposed to by conducting climate scenario

analysis, measuring the GHG emissions

associated with our financing portfolio

and evaluating portfolio decarbonization

pathways. During 2021, we conducted an

analysis of our Energy and Power loan

portfolios to establish baseline emissions

and establish interim 2030 emissions

targets as we work toward our net zero

commitment. Learn more about this

analysis and our targets in the Energy

and Power Baseline Emissions and Interim

Targets section.

Our Commitment to Reduce Financing for Coal

Thermal Coal Mining

Our ESRM Policy commitments related to coal mining began in 2009, with our first coal
mining Sector Approach. Since that time, we have updated our policy, including updates
focused on enhanced due diligence and continued reductions in our credit exposure to
the coal mining industry. As of 2020, Citi has established a policy prohibition on project-
related financing of new thermal coal mines and significant expansions. We have also
committed to the following targets to reduce our exposure to companies that derive 25%
or more of their revenue from thermal coal mining:
By the end of 2025: Reduce our credit exposure to these companies by 50% from
a 2020 baseline
After 2025: No longer facilitate capital markets transactions or mergers and acquisition
advisory and financing for these companies
By the end of 2030: Reduce all remaining exposure to these companies to zero
Coal-Fired Power Generation
Our ESRM Policy commitments related to coal-fired power generation have also been
updated over time as the credit and reputation risk related to coal has increased. We have
committed to not finance any new coal-fired power plants or expansions of existing plants.
Our expectations have increased as we aim to help our clients transition to a future aligned
with the Paris Agreement. A comprehensive summary of time-bound milestones for coal-fired
power clients through 2040 is available in our Environmental and Social Policy Framework.
In 2021, we reviewed our coal-fired power clients’ GHG reporting and low-carbon
transition plans, including commitments to retire existing coal plants. Our analysis
considered a combination of client disclosures, third-party ESG analysis, CDP disclosures
and direct client engagement. Moving forward, this evaluation will be wrapped into our
net zero engagement and progress towards our 2030 targets.

During 2021, we updated our climate risk
heat-mapping framework to refine our
understanding of the sectors we finance
that are most sensitive to climate risk.
The heat map on the following pages is
based on a qualitative assessment of how
transition and physical climate risk drivers
are expected to impact different sectors.
The results of this assessment will help
us to prioritize portfolios when further
evaluating risks.

Engagement

Engagement with our stakeholders, clients

and industry experts helps us to stay

current in our understanding of this critical

and evolving area of impact, to strengthen

our management and analysis of climate

risk in our portfolio and to advance prog-

ress in this area across industries.

During 2021, we hosted a stakeholder

engagement session, facilitated by Ceres,

for clients, investors and nongovernmental

organizations. Participants provided

input on Citi’s TCFD disclosures and our

approach to setting net zero targets

and measuring our baseline emissions.

Feedback from that session has been

integrated into our 2021 TCFD report and
will guide our progress as we continue to
develop our net zero plan. See our 2021
TCFD Report for a summary of key take-
aways from the session.
To advance progress, we have worked with
organizations such as Rocky Mountain
Institute’s Center for Climate-Aligned
Finance. The Center works with financial
institutions on identifying 1.5°C-aligned
emissions reduction pathways for sectoral
portfolio measurement and target-setting
and developing credible institutional tran-
sition plans. In addition, Citi contributed
to the World Economic Forum’s Financing
the Transition to a Net-Zero Future report.
The report reflects input from financial
institutions and the public sector related
to mobilizing investments in breakthrough
technologies that will facilitate a more
sustainable future.
Our Sustainability & Corporate Transitions
team and Natural Resources & Clean
Energy Transition team engage with
our clients to pursue opportunities and
support their efforts to transition to net
zero. Learn more in the Financing the
Low-Carbon Transition section.

CITI 2021 ESG REPORT 49

Sustainable Operations

Citi has a history of prioritizing

healthy buildings, along with

two decades of measuring and

reducing our environmental

footprint. We are well-positioned

to meet the dual challenges of

climate change and COVID-19

head on, as we enable sustainable

operations and healthy facilities

for our customers and employees.

Net Zero Commitment

Citi’s commitment to achieve net zero

GHG emissions by 2050 includes both our

financing and our own operations. For

our operations, we are targeting net zero

emissions by 2030. This includes GHG

emissions related to our owned and leased

facilities, employee commuting and busi-

ness travel, and emissions associated with

our supply chain.

During 2021, we undertook a discovery and

planning process to develop a strategy for

reaching this commitment. This included

broad engagement with employees from

our Enterprise Operations & Technology

group, and analysis to help us define the

boundaries of the commitment, under-

stand the potential challenges, and identify

short-, medium- and long-term priorities to

help us reach our goal.

With the announcement of our

commitment to net zero GHG emissions,

we broadened our engagement with

employees across Citi, including those

working in the areas of real estate,

technology, supply chain, shared services,

travel and facility operations. Our goal was

to increase understanding and capabilities

across our organization, while also gaining

greater insight into the full scope of our

GHG emissions. Employees in these groups
helped evaluate their own processes
to identify and map GHG emissions
throughout Citi. We then engaged a third
party to help us quantify those emissions.
This engagement has set the stage for
collaboration as we drive toward net zero
in our operations.
As part of our discovery process, we
also expanded our GHG inventory. We
have been tracking Scope 1, Scope 2
and a portion of Scope 3 GHG emissions
related to our own operations for many
years. However, this was the first time
we included broader Scope 3 emissions
related to our supply chain, which is inte-
gral to grasping the total impact of our
operations.
Due to limitations in data availability
and quality, we used spend data and
industry emissions factors from the US
Environmentally-Extended Input-Output
Models as the basis for our GHG inventory.
While this approach has its limitations, the
insights we have gleaned from this analysis
are nonetheless helping us identify priority
areas that warrant additional investigation
and suppliers we can meaningfully engage
with to create the greatest impact. As
supplier-specific data becomes available
and methodologies improve, we will
recalculate our supply chain emissions.
The GHG inventory is available in our 2021
Task Force on Climate-related Financial
Disclosures (TCFD) report.
We are keenly aware that a balanced
approach will be needed to drive emissions
reductions for our operations. This might
include a reduction in our consumption
of supplier goods and services, while also
engaging with suppliers to drive process
improvements and innovations. We are
also working toward our 2025 operational
footprint goals (see following page), which
aim to reduce GHG emissions and energy
consumption for our operations. In addi-
tion, we are piloting zero-carbon building
requirements for all new Citi buildings,
targeting emissions from operations as
well as embodied emissions in the materi-
als used to construct the buildings.
See the Climate Risk and Net Zero section
for an overview of our commitment to net
zero GHG emissions, including as it relates
to our financing.

Operational

Footprint Goals

We have been measuring our environ-

mental footprint for two decades and

began reporting on our direct operational

impacts in 2002. This report marks our

first disclosure on progress against our

fourth generation of operational footprint

goals, which we announced in 2020 and

aim to achieve by 2025. These goals are

aligned with a pathway to limit global

temperature rise to 1.5°C and cover GHG
emissions, energy use, water consumption,
waste reduction and diversion, and sustain-
able building design.
Because of the ongoing COVID-19
pandemic, our facilities were not used
at full capacity in 2021, and our related
resource consumption, waste generation
and GHG emissions were lower than they
otherwise would have been. We recognize
that in some cases these impacts were
simply moved to employees’ homes and
other non-Citi facilities. As a result of
having fewer people using Citi buildings,
our progress for 2021 indicates that we
exceeded some of our goals during the
year. That trend could briefly reverse in the
coming years as our employees continue
to return to the office, before progressing
again toward meeting our goals.
2025 Operational Footprint Goals

This is the first year we are reporting progress against our 2025 goals. We expect our progress to fluctuate as the number of people occupying

our facilities varies during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

In connection with our renewable electricity commitment, Citi is a member of RE100 — a global initiative led by the Climate Group and CDP

(formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project), which are both part of the We Mean Business Coalition. In recognition of RE100’s requirements, we

strive as much as possible to source 100% renewable electricity within the same market boundaries as our consumption.

CITI 2021 ESG REPORT 51

In 2021, Citi Tower Hong Kong installed our largest on-site renewable energy
system to date. This hybrid system generates energy for water heating and
electricity. The system includes 360 solar panels, which we estimate will
generate over 85,000 kilowatt-hours annually, avoiding 70 metric tons of CO 2
emissions each year. The site also has a small wind turbine.
With the installation of
solar panels for two more
locations completed
in 2021, we now have
six bank branches in
Mexico with on-site
solar generation. These
branches receive from
60% to 80% of their
electricity needs from
on-site solar power,
including the branch
pictured at right in
Mexico City. The six
branches have a total
of 348 solar panels and
a combined capacity
of 115 kilowatts when
operating at their peak
output. In 2021, these
sites produced 64,000
kilowatt-hours of
electricity.
Sustainable Building

Principles in Action

Whether undertaking new construction or

renovating existing buildings, we prioritize

efficiency and sustainability, to minimize

the environmental impact of our facilities

across the globe. Buildings are responsible

for about 40% of global energy use and

approximately one-third of GHG emissions.^2

Since our own operations consist largely of

buildings, we have developed and are pilot-

ing requirements for all new buildings to be

zero carbon by 2030, in support of our net

zero commitments. These requirements

address both operational and embodied

carbon emissions, inclusive of energy use,

energy supply, integration with utilities and

material use.

Citi is currently renovating a facility in

Gray, Tennessee, to align with our zero-

carbon requirements. The plans for this

facility include features to reduce energy

use as much as possible and to meet any

remaining energy needs with renewable

sources. Aligning this building with our

zero-carbon building requirements will

also benefit the well-being of those using

the building. For instance, a tight building

seal will improve air quality and thermal

comfort for those inside and will also

improve energy efficiency.

One of our 2025 goals is to have 40% of

our facilities, by floor area, LEED, WELL

or equivalent certified. In 2021, we earned

certifications for several sustainable build-

ing projects in pursuit of this goal:

- Guatemala (LEED Gold): Reducing

the environmental impact of the
interior construction of our offices in
Guatemala was instrumental in our
ability to achieve LEED Gold for this site.
Design features include high-efficiency
fixtures and equipment to reduce water
consumption by 41.5% and electrical

WELL Building Health-Safety Rating

In 2021, as a result of our health and safety practices, we received the
International WELL Building Health-Safety Rating for all Citi facilities
globally, including offices, operations centers, data centers and retail
locations. This seal helps assure our employees and customers that
our buildings are safe and healthy environments. The seal is awarded
to businesses that meet rigorous scientific standards, maintenance
protocols and emergency plans to address concerns related to COVID-19
and other infectious diseases now and into the future.

WELL Portfolio Program

Building on the success of the WELL Health-Safety Rating, Citi joined
the WELL Portfolio Program — a benchmarking program for measuring
and improving organizational health performance across facilities.
The WELL Portfolio Program leverages the strategies of the WELL
building standard, the leading health-focused building standard. As a
participating organization, Citi will receive an annual portfolio score
based on our work to support and enhance the health and well-being of
employees and customers who work in and visit our buildings every day.
consumption by 15.7%. We also reused
77% of the facility’s furniture to reduce
waste, and we were able to effectively
manage construction-related waste,
capping the volume sent to landfill
at 31.7 kg/m^2 , which is 15% below the
industry standard.
- Paraguay (EDGE Advanced): We

earned our first EDGE Advanced
Certification for our Agrovet Offices
in Paraguay. The Excellence in Design
for Greater Efficiencies (EDGE) certi-
fication system evaluates buildings
in three resource categories: energy,
water and materials. We earned
Advanced Certification through the
use of features that increase energy
efficiency by 63% (mainly related
to the building’s heating and cooling
systems), increase water efficiency by
20% through high-efficiency accesso-
ries in restrooms and reduce embodied
energy of materials used for interior
spaces by 89%.
- China, Taiwan, United States (LEED
Volume Program): We accomplished
LEED v2009 certification for 11 bank
branches through the LEED Volume
Program and achieved LEED v4 Gold
for our fourth retail prototype. All new
and renovated bank branches will be
LEED Certified based on this model.

We are also planning a significant renova-
tion of Citi Tower in London, headquarters
for our Europe, Middle East and Africa
region. For this project, which we expect
to complete in 2025, we are prioritizing
sustainable building principles and
employee well-being in alignment with
LEED, BREEAM and WELL standards. By
renovating the existing building, rather
than demolishing it to build a new struc-
ture, we will avoid releasing an estimated
100,000 metric tons of embodied carbon,^
equivalent to 21,748 passenger vehicles
driven for one year.^3 We are designing
Citi Tower London for energy efficiency
from top to bottom, within the constraints
of an existing building, and are factoring
carbon emissions into our decision-making
process. The building will feature rooftop
solar panels generating more than 52,000
kilowatt-hours per year annually — enough
to power 18 average UK homes^4 for one
year. Efficient fixtures will reduce water
consumption by 20%^5 and a grey water

reuse system will help us save an esti-

mated 29.5 cubic meters of water each

day, enough to fill 4.3 Olympic pools over

the course of a year.^6 During construction,

we plan to refurbish and reuse materials

on-site to reduce waste and embodied

carbon, and we will work to significantly

minimize waste sent to landfill.

Employee and

Customer Well-Being

For many years, Citi has prioritized the

intersection of sustainability and employee

well-being. When looking at how our

buildings can affect the well-being of our

employees, we manage air quality and

acoustics, as well as providing ergonomic

furniture, opportunities to stay active,

healthy food options and a work environ-

ment that is both flexible and effective.

As a result of our efforts, we’ve received

WELL Silver certification from the

International WELL Building Institute™ for

two facilities, one each in Hong Kong and

India. Both facilities are going through

the WELL recertification process, which

is required every three years. We are

also working toward WELL certification

for our London headquarters renovation.

The WELL Building Standard is a system

for measuring, certifying and monitoring

building features that impact the health

and well-being of occupants. In recognition

of how important it is to design buildings

for employee well-being, we have included

WELL certification as an aspect of our

sustainable building goal for 2025.

The COVID-19 pandemic further

emphasized the importance of employee

well-being at our office facilities,

in addition to the well-being of our

employees and customers within our

branches. With this in mind, we have

instituted initiatives and protocols

aligned with the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention guidelines. These
measures include improved ventilation
and air treatment systems; signage about
effective handwashing; sanitizer stations;
enhanced cleaning measures to reduce
exposure to pathogens, allergens and
harmful chemicals; and rules related to
social distancing and masks. In addition,
we have installed plexiglass barriers in our
branches to provide increased protection
for our employees and customers. To
further support our colleagues, we are
also providing employees with additional
physical and mental health resources.
Employee

Engagement

Our colleagues contribute to our culture
of sustainability through volunteer efforts
and awareness campaigns. Despite the
challenges a remote working environment
posed during 2021, Citi piloted an Earth
Day initiative within its global Green Team
Network of 18 teams. This initiative encour-
aged employees to live more sustainably
and complete tasks to save water, reduce
waste and energy consumption and learn
more about climate change.
In one year, this equals 10,767.5 cubic meters. Olympic pool size: 2,500 cubic meters. 10,767.5/2,500 = approx. 4.3.
Contents ESG at Citi Sustainable Finance Sustainable Progress Equitable & Resilient Communities Talent & DEI Risk Management & Responsible Business Appendices

CITI 2021 ESG REPORT 54

Beyond Earth Day, employees across the

company also contribute to sustainability

initiatives as a part of their regular

work responsibilities. For example, many

of our employees have sustainability-

related responsibilities as part of their

day-to-day work, such as those involved

in our climate risk, environmental and

social risk management and low-carbon

transition efforts.

Efficient Travel

Options

Due to COVID-19, employee commuting

and business travel has dropped signifi-

cantly since 2019. For many years, we have

encouraged employees to use video and

web conferencing technologies rather than

traveling, whenever possible. With the

onset of the global pandemic, we quickly

transitioned the entire company to adopt

use of these platforms for their daily

interactions. As our employees return to

the office, we are relying on the efficiency

efforts we had in place before the onset of

COVID-19. For instance, many of our offices

are centrally located near public transpor-

tation, which reduces the need for employ-

ees to drive to work, and we provide U.S.-

based employees pretax dollars to cover

the cost of commuting by subway, bus,

train, ferry and vanpool. We also offer bike

storage and bike racks at several facilities

and sponsor bike share programs, known

as the Citi Bike® Program, in New York

City, Jersey City and Miami. At our car

park in the Citigroup Centre in London, we

offer a dozen charging stations for those

driving electric vehicles.

Due to our global scale, we often need to

meet with clients, partners, teams and

other stakeholders across the world. Now

that many colleagues across the firm have

started traveling again, we are working to

build awareness for how business travel

impacts our carbon footprint. For example,

when employees book travel reservations,

they are able to see the emissions data
related to their air travel. We plan to
include emissions data for rail travel,
hotels and rental cars in the future.
Managing Climate Risk

in Our Operations

The effects of climate change, particularly
extreme weather events, pose a potential
risk to our operations. Our Citi Realty
Services (CRS) Group and our Crisis
Management and Business Continuity
teams help us to monitor, prepare for
and respond to extreme weather events
or other disruptions to our operations.
In addition, CRS conducts due diligence
for each proposed new location and
reassesses the properties’ structural
resilience periodically, based on risk, as
well as following significant events. These
assessments take internal Citi standards,
as well as local and international codes,
into account.
Because Citi operates in nearly 100
countries, our facilities could potentially
be exposed to a range of varied climate-
related risks. To increase our resiliency,
we have invested in climate adaptation
solutions in a number of critical facilities.
In addition, our crisis management
team has developed action plans to
address immediate risks and support our
employees and customers before, during
and after adverse events. Our business
continuity team also has plans in place to
help Citi resume business operations as
quickly as possible in the aftermath of an
extreme climate event.
Transparent Reporting

of Operational Climate

Impacts

Citi reports our Scope 1, Scope 2 and
Scope 3 GHG emissions in both this ESG
report and in our CDP response. We began
reporting on the direct environmental
impacts of our operations in 2002 and
have submitted data to CDP every year
since 2003. We follow the GHG Protocol
Corporate Standard and Scope 2 Guidance
for measuring and reporting both market-
based and location-based Scope 1 and
Scope 2 GHG emissions.
We also report Scope 3 CO 2 emissions from
air and train business travel in this ESG
report, and we report Scope 3 electricity
transmission loss and employee commut-
ing data to CDP. In early 2022, Citi received
the following scores from CDP related to
2020 data:
- Climate change score: A-
- Supplier engagement score: A

Our GHG emissions and environmental
data for our operations and business travel
are verified and assured by SGS, a leading
third-party inspection, verification, testing
and certification company. For our SGS
Assurance Statement, see the Assurance
section.

CITI 2021 ESG REPORT 60

Over the past two years, the

COVID-19 pandemic reaffirmed

the urgency to address the

vast and growing inequities

facing our global society, from

financial security and access

to basic human necessities to

affordable housing and economic

opportunity. Throughout 2021,

Citi and the Citi Foundation

accelerated and expanded

investments in communities

around the world, helping to

support a more inclusive recovery

and more equitable future.

Building on our longstanding leadership in

financial inclusion, we expanded the scope

of our social finance efforts to maximize

our impacts and to help achieve the $500

Billion Social Finance Goal we set as part

of our overall $1 trillion commitment to

sustainable finance by 2030. We invested

$1 billion in a broad suite of initiatives

designed to help close the racial wealth

gap in the United States and to increase

economic mobility through Citi and the

Citi Foundation’s Action for Racial Equity

commitment. And we increased our invest-

ments in the Citi Impact Fund, more than

half of which went to minority-owned and

women-owned companies.

We also continued to support COVID-19

relief and recovery efforts globally while

staying focused on our long-term priorities,

including affordable housing and the Citi

Foundation’s strategic grantmaking efforts.

Our Commitment to Social Finance

Billions of people around the

world lack access to basic

necessities — clean water,

education, electricity, financial

products, housing, medicine —

hampering their economic

progress and social growth.

As an institution with a longstanding

history of driving positive social impact

and financial innovations that benefit

communities around the world, we took

our commitment to a new level in 2021:

announcing a $500 Billion Social Finance

Goal as part of our $1 trillion commitment

to sustainable finance by 2030 with corre-

sponding criteria for activities related to

affordable basic infrastructure, affordable

housing, diversity and equity, economic

inclusion, education, food security and

healthcare.

Many of our Citi business units — including

Banking, Capital Markets and Advisory;

Global Markets; Trade and Treasury

Services; Citi Community Capital; and

Citi Commercial Bank — are dedicated

to delivering products and services that

can contribute to the social finance goal.

These include the issuance of social bonds

and sustainability-linked bonds, financing

and advisory services to companies with

social missions, creation of municipal

bonds with social use of proceeds (such as

education or health), or loans and facilities

with eligible social use of proceeds. We

have broadened the focus of our global

Citi Social Finance team, formerly our

Inclusive Finance team, which works

across Citi businesses globally to develop

scalable business platforms and client

solutions that enable the bank, our clients

and partners to expand financial inclusion,

accelerate access to basic services, boost

job creation and scale social infrastructure
development in emerging markets. As part
of our social finance focus, we are aiming
to invest in opportunities for 15 million
low-income households, including 10 million
women, globally by 2025.
The recent expansion of this team builds
on our 15-year track record of developing
new business models and partnerships
that leverage market-based approaches
to improve the livelihoods of low-income
communities around the world. Since
2007, these efforts have reached
4.1 million unbanked and underbanked
individuals in emerging markets —
including 3.7 million women.
These efforts, which are focused on
supporting emerging markets, are comple-
mented by our social finance activities in
higher-income countries, such as our work
to finance affordable housing projects in
the United States and to issue bonds that
help advance a range of social solutions.
Read some case studies of the deals
that will contribute to our $1 trillion
commitment later in this chapter and in
the Sustainable Finance section.
Our extensive work on social finance
contributes to progress on SDG 8 , which
aims, among other things, to provide
full and productive employment and
decent work for all. For example, Citi’s
work on financial inclusion around the
world contributes to target 8.3 , which
encourages productive activities,
decent job creation, entrepreneurship,
creativity and innovation, and the
formalization and growth of micro-,
small- and medium-sized enterprises
through access to financial services.
Our approach also supports target 8.10 ,
which aims to strengthen the capacity
of domestic financial institutions to
encourage and expand access to
banking, insurance and financial
services for all.
Social finance is also a key success factor
for progress on SDG 9 , which aims to
build resilient infrastructure, promote
inclusive and sustainable industrializa-
tion and foster innovation , specifically
enabling progress on target 9.3 , which
seeks to increase the access of small-
scale enterprises, facilitating integration
into value chains and markets.
And our work on catalyzing the distribu-
tion of small loans in emerging markets
— which typically benefits women — directly
contributes to SDG 5 , in support of gender
equality and empowerment for all women
and girls , and in particular target 5.a ,
which strives for a range of gender-related
objectives, including giving women equal
rights to economic resources.

Bond Offerings Advance Social Initiatives

In October 2021, we issued our inaugural Citi Social Finance Bond, a $1 billion bond offering to support social and economic development

efforts or activities that increase opportunity and access to essential basic services. Proceeds from the bond will finance a range of

projects, including those that expand access to financial services, affordable housing, basic infrastructure, healthcare and education in

underserved and unbanked communities in emerging markets.

The bond offering followed the release of our Citi Social Finance Framework, one of the world’s first global social finance frameworks

focused on enabling financial inclusion, affordable housing and access to essential services in emerging markets. The framework, which

was developed in line with the International Capital Market Association (ICMA) Social Bond Principles 2021,*^ details how projects and

assets will be selected. We will report annually on the use of funds and related impacts.

The Citi Social Finance Bond follows the 2020 issuance of Citi’s inaugural $2.5 billion Affordable Housing Bond, which was then the

largest-ever social bond from an issuer in the private sector. Learn more.

* Sustainalytics, an independent provider of sustainability research, analysis and services to financial institutions globally, reviewed the Framework and confirmed in its assessment
the alignment with the transparency and reporting requirements of the ICMA Social Bond Principles 2021.

Social Finance Transactions

The following are examples of social finance transactions from 2021 that demonstrate our efforts to drive positive social impact in

underserved communities around the world. Other examples can be found in the Sustainable Finance section.

In Sub-Saharan Africa, more than 50 million families earn a
living from small farms, which produce 80% of the continent’s
food. But harvests still lag far behind the rest of the world.
The nonprofit One Acre Fund supplies smallholder farmers
with everything they need to grow more food and earn more
money, with the primary goal of enhancing food security. In
partnership with the U.S. International Development Finance
Corporation (DFC), Citi structured a $10 million flexible working
capital solution for One Acre Fund in Kenya and an additional
$5 million working capital facility for the other seven African
countries where One Acre Fund operates. Since 2015, farmers
who participate in One Acre Fund’s programs earn on average
nearly 50% more than peer farmers who are not on One Acre
Fund-supported activities.
EXPANDING ACCESS TO LOANS IN BANGLADESH

Basic Unit for Resources and Opportunities of Bangladesh
(BURO Bangladesh) is a leading microfinance institution that
offers high-quality loans, savings and insurance to small
businesses, smallholder farmers and women. BURO Bangladesh
currently serves more than 2.2 million low-income women,
with average loans of approximately $850. In 2021, Citi was
the sole arranger of $68 million in in equivalent local currency,
which is expected to give 85,000 people — 80% of them
women — access to finance.

Banco Nacional de Obras y Servicios Públicos, Sociedad

development bank that seeks to improve the quality of life
of local populations while contributing to the country’s
sustainable development. Banobras provides financing to
public and private investment projects focused on the delivery
of essential infrastructure and public service projects. In
September, Citibanamex acted as a joint bookrunner for an
approximately $500,000 local sustainability bond linked
to basic infrastructure projects — infrastructure damaged
by natural disasters; renewables: wind farms, photovoltaic

d.light is a global leader and pioneer in delivering affordable

in the developing world without access to reliable energy.
Through four hubs in Africa, China, South Asia and the
United States, d.light has sold more than 20 million solar
light and power products in 70 countries, improving the lives
of over 100 million people. In 2019, Citi provided a $5 million
working capital loan in local currency to enable d.light to
provide clean energy solutions that improve livelihoods
in Kenya. In 2021, Citi provided an incremental $3 million
working capital facility.

CITI 2021 ESG REPORT 65

Action for Racial Equity

In the midst of a global pandemic

that disproportionately affected

communities of color, we took a

hard look at ourselves and our

own contribution to the status

quo. We saw how we could use

our power — as individuals, as a

company and as an industry —

to drive a lasting transformative

movement toward greater equity.

The result was Action for Racial Equity , a

four-pronged commitment of Citi and the

Citi Foundation to invest more than $1 billion

by 2023 in strategic initiatives to provide

greater access to banking and credit in

communities of color, increase investment

in Black-owned businesses, expand afford-

able housing and homeownership among

Black Americans, and advance anti-racist

practices in our own company and in the

financial services industry.

By November 2021 — one year into our

three-year pledge — we had already invested

$1 billion into initiatives expanding economic

opportunity for communities of color,

putting us on track to exceed our original

$1.1 billion commitment set in 2020.

Since the launch of Action for Racial Equity ,

we have been engaged across our business

to think and act in support of equity and

our goal of closing the racial wealth gap

and increasing economic mobility in the

United States. Throughout 2021, we worked

on one of our key measures of success —

institutionalizing the commitment to racial

equity across the firm. For example, we

created the Diverse Financial Institutions

Group, a dedicated team within Citi that is

serving as a hub to lead and expand firm-

wide engagement with minority depository

institutions (MDIs), diverse broker-dealers

and diverse asset managers. We’re also
diversifying our teams to better serve
our communities. We started to develop a
centralized Financial Inclusion and Racial
Equity Segment Team within U.S. Personal
Banking to develop targeted and inte-
grated segment strategies, drive seamless
customer-centric execution, and champion
greater financial inclusion, racial equity
and customer protection.
We’re harnessing our influence to
encourage our law firm and agency
partners to join us in efforts to advance
racial equity. We obtained detailed
diversity data from the U.S. law partners
who make up more than two-thirds of our
U.S. legal spend, enabling us to identify
opportunities to increase representation
of diverse attorneys on Citi’s legal matters.
And we’re working with advertising agency
partners that comprise the largest portion
of our marketing spend to increase diverse
representation of agency teams, including
senior leadership, to help ensure diversity
in Citi marketing materials.
We recognize that to continue closing the
racial wealth gap, we need an approach
that sparks immediate change while also
creating economic solutions that support
systemic change for the long term. We
also recognize the need to hold ourselves
accountable, starting with being trans-
parent about where we are and where
we need to continue pushing to improve.
That’s why we committed to a third-party
racial equity audit of our Action for
Racial Equity commitments. Additionally,
we were the first major Wall Street
bank to participate in the Management
Leadership for Tomorrow Black Equity
at Work Certification, which was created
to help guide companies and keep them
accountable for making progress around
Black equity. (Learn more about the
certification in the Talent and Diversity,
Equity & Inclusion section.)
Our Action for Racial Equity commitments
contribute to SDG 8 , which aims, among
other things, to provide full and produc-
tive employment and decent work for all
and specifically contributes to target 8.3 ,
which supports productive activities,
decent job creation, entrepreneurship,
creativity and innovation, and the
formalization and growth of micro-,
small- and medium-sized enterprises
through access to financial services.
Our approach also supports target 8.10 :
to strengthen the capacity of domestic
financial institutions to encourage and
expand access to banking, insurance and
financial services for all. The affordable
housing components of Action for Racial
Equity align with SDG target 11.1 , which
includes providing access for all to
adequate, safe and affordable housing
and basic services.

RACIAL EQUITY AUDIT

Measurement and transparency are essential components of our efforts to advance diversity, equity and inclusion both
at our own bank and through our contributions to our communities and society more broadly. In that spirit, we committed
to conduct a third-party racial equity audit to assess our efforts to help address the racial wealth gap in the United
States through the design and implementation of Action for Racial Equity.
Covington & Burling LLP, which has civil rights expertise and experience leading racial equity audits across various
industries, is conducting the audit. The firm is gathering input from a range of stakeholders, including Citi employees
involved in implementing Action for Racial Equity , financial institutions and other partners directly benefiting or
involved in implementing the initiative, and civil rights organizations that can represent the views of the customers
and communities the initiative is designed to support. Conducting an audit of Action for Racial Equity will help Citi
assess our work and will show where we can adapt and grow to make an even more meaningful impact going forward.
The audit represents another step in our efforts to strengthen Citi’s policies and practices in order to become an anti-
racist institution. The audit began in January 2022, and we look forward to sharing the findings following its expected
completion at the end of 2022.
BRIDGE BUILT BY CITISM

Many small- and medium-sized businesses in the United States find that securing a loan can be a time-consuming,
manual process. Business owners are often limited to banks near their own locations, while local and community banks
can have a tough time broadening their reach to potential borrowers.
Enter Bridge built by CitiSM , a new lending platform that democratizes the loan process by matching small- and medium-
sized businesses online with regional, local and community banks for loans up to $10 million. Launched in August 2021,
the platform aims to expand access to capital for smaller businesses while widening the customer base for lenders.
Twenty-nine banks, including nine minority depository institutions (MDIs), are participating in a pilot program in seven
states in the Southeast and Rockies regions.
Learn more about our engagement with other MDIs.

CITI 2021 ESG REPORT 68

Collaborating with MDIs

Minority depository institutions (MDIs) have long been the trusted source of banking and access to capital for communities of color.
For generations, they have provided essential financial services, especially for Black Americans who have not had equitable access to
the mainstream banking system and therefore had fewer opportunities to build generational wealth.
Research shows that, compared with other financial institutions, MDIs originate a greater share of mortgages to borrowers of color.*
They also originate a greater share of small business loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration to entrepreneurs of color
than other financial institutions.
But since 2001, the number of Black-owned and operated banks has declined by more than half.** As of September 2021, there were
only 20 Black banking institutions, and only one of them held more than $1 billion of assets.***
One of the four goals of Action for Racial Equity is expanding banking and access to credit in communities of color, in part through
collaboration with MDIs. During Citi focus groups with Black MDIs, leaders overwhelmingly prioritized access to capital and capacity-
building investments to grow their revenue and operations, which would enable the MDIs to diversify products and expand services.
Our collaboration with Unity National Bank is just one example of how we’re offering expertise and guidance to MDIs. We have
supported growth capital opportunities for Unity by providing an equity investment and inviting Unity in on select project-based
affordable housing lending opportunities, including a loan for 381 affordable housing units in Texas.
We also onboarded Unity on the Bridge built by Citi

SM
platform to help expand their customer base, and we have enabled Unity to gain
contract-based revenue as a subcontractor on existing Citi federal business lines. In order to help Unity prepare for long-term growth,
we’re collaborating on shared media and client conversations and supporting talent acquisition by exposing high-achieving students of
color to banking as a career. Further, pro bono technical assistance delivered in collaboration with Deloitte and the National Bankers
Association is helping Unity to strengthen access to talent pipeline development initiatives and corporate board seats.
In 2021, we doubled down on our collaboration with Unity by piloting the Citi Rotational Program, which embedded a Citi executive
at Unity with the mandate of supporting revenue generation through the New Markets Tax Credit Program and expanding their
affordable housing work.
Lack of wealth generation opportunities and access to

affordable housing continue to plague Black and Brown

communities, and our mission is to create equitable access

to capital to help fill that void. We’re thrilled to have the

continued support and partnership of Citi, including their

equity investment and embedded senior counsel, to help grow

our business. Together, we can find more opportunities to drive

economic value and impact in the communities we serve.”

Citi Impact Fund

The Citi Impact Fund is a $200

million venture capital fund with

a mission of investing in “double

bottom line” companies that are

addressing societal challenges,

such as reaching low- and

moderate-income households with

innovative financial and workforce

services, delivering solutions for

the climate transition economy,

and addressing needs for inclusive

healthcare and housing.

Venture capital funding has historically
been inaccessible to most start-up found-
ers, but especially so for women and
people of color.
The fund, which at its founding in 2020
was the largest impact fund ever launched
by a bank using its own capital, focuses
on companies that are led or owned by
women or racial/ethnic minorities. We
started the fund with $150 million in
January 2020, adding another $50 million
specifically to support businesses owned
by Black entrepreneurs as part of Action
for Racial Equity.

Making an Impact

Since its launch in early 2020, the Citi Impact Fund made investments in 31 U.S.-based, double-bottom line

companies with business models built around positive social and environmental impact and outcomes. Thirteen of

those investments were in companies with Black founders who are working to help close the racial wealth, education,

healthcare and connectivity gaps in the United States, directly impacting marginalized communities for the better.

Below are just some of the companies we have invested in. For the full list, visit our website.

For nearly five years, Cityblock Health has been radically transforming healthcare for underserved and marginalized
communities across the country. The Citi Impact Fund’s investment has helped us continue to scale our services and
align business and clinical models around equitable and improved outcomes. Citi’s partnership is strong validation
of our mission and how critically important it is to democratize access to high-quality, comprehensive care in our
communities.”

“

The events of the last two years have stressed the importance of high-speed, low-cost broadband availability for
all Americans. The hardest hit communities have seen regression in education and remote job capabilities due to
lack of broadband options. Through our valuable partnership with Citi, Flume has been able to build out its initial
gigabit fiber network and connect thousands of underserved people, affordable housing units, new developments and
suburbs. With the Citi platform allowing Flume to rapidly deploy its technology, we can make a substantial impact
on closing the digital divide with our network deployment.”

Full Harvest is thrilled to have Citi Impact Fund as a new investment partner, given their aligned values with our
mission to help solve the $2.6 trillion global food waste problem. Full Harvest tackles food waste at the farm level with
the world’s first online business-to-business produce marketplace specializing in imperfect and surplus produce. Our
technology improves efficiencies for produce buyers and farms and captures market insights not previously available,
all while reducing one of the largest contributors to climate change: food waste. With Citi Impact Fund’s investment,
Full Harvest is able to achieve even more impact and revenue by scaling our technology further, expanding into new
geographies and commodities and growing our team. A win-win-win for farmers, food companies and the planet.”

COVID-19 Relief and Recovery

Throughout 2021, Citi and the Citi

Foundation continued to address

immediate needs for COVID-19

relief while staying focused on

longer-term economic recovery.

Many of our efforts were geared

toward underserved communities

around the world, which were

facing disproportionate burdens

from the global pandemic.

By the end of 2021, Citi and the Citi

Foundation had contributed more than

$160 million in COVID-19 and recovery

efforts since the beginning of the

pandemic. Total contributions included

$3 million from Citi employees to date. Citi

and the Citi Foundation provided support

to organizations — small and large — all

around the world: food donations and meal

kits to help people facing food insecurity;

support for housing stability loans; emer-

gency child care programs; medical and

personal protective equipment; COVID-19

screening and testing funds, and more.

In India, as cases surged in the spring

of 2021, Citi pledged $27 million over

three years toward recovery and relief

efforts. Of the total pledged, $10 million

was allocated immediately toward the

procurement of oxygen supplies and

other equipment for frontline healthcare

workers. The funds also went toward food

and hygiene supplies for approximately

200,000 low-income families.

In Asia, the Citi Foundation’s grant to

the Resilient Cities Network supports

small- and medium-sized businesses

while advancing the recovery of selected

cities in the region. The Catalyzing City

Resilience Solutions (CCRS) program is

working with municipal governments to

help local economies recover from the

pandemic by identifying critical small- and
medium-sized enterprises (SME) and
empowering them to create and scale
urban solutions that will enable greater
resilience. CCRS is structured to include
an initial assessment phase where cities
can assess the impact of the pandemic
on a particular sector and local economy;
an accelerator phase where cities and the
selected SME sector co-create solutions
that address critical resiliency challenges;
and a pilot project phase to demonstrate
the potential of the selected solution.
The participating city of Melaka, Malaysia,
for example, is exploring how to support
the SME ecosystem along the Melaka
riverfront, which was especially affected
by a drop in tourism. The assessment
phase revealed that SMEs in the area are
facing gaps in knowledge and capacity to
rebuild from the pandemic and that there
is a lack of stakeholder communication to
deliver on resilience initiatives. Based on
these findings, Melaka will launch and test
a platform to increase collaboration among
key stakeholders through joint trainings
and problem-solving sessions for govern-
ment officials and local entrepreneurs.
In the United States, the Citi Foundation
announced a $25 million investment to
be distributed to nonprofit organizations
that provide technical assistance to
minority-owned businesses navigating
the continued economic impacts of the
pandemic. The 50 grant recipients, which
each received $500,000 in unrestricted
support, are local, community-based
change agents that have the expertise,
experience and relationships to provide
tailored, on-the-ground support for
affected businesses and the communities
they serve.
In addition, Citi deepened our relationship
with No Kid Hungry, an organization
working to end childhood hunger in the
United States, to help address the ongoing
issue of food insecurity during COVID-19.
In 2021, we provided $2.8 million in new
funding to support various campaigns
aimed at helping the rapid response to
school and community needs in New York
City. Learn more about our work with No

Vaccine Alliance Advisor

Back in October of 2020, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, appointed Citi as the sole financial advisor to the COVAX Facility, a global multilateral

procurement mechanism created to provide fair and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines for every country in the world. The COVAX

Facility developed a diversified, active vaccine portfolio management strategy to secure vaccine supply for all participating countries.

Pooled procurement gave COVAX leverage to negotiate highly competitive prices, speedy deployment and better terms, especially for

low- and middle-income countries.

Since that appointment, Citi has been advising on credit, liquidity and operational and contractual risks, including planning and execution

of mitigation strategies. The Facility is co-led by Gavi, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and the World Health

Organization.

In September 2021, Citi, in conjunction with the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), began providing a risk

management solution to Gavi to enable the funding for COVID-19 vaccine purchases through the COVAX Facility.

In another effort to support equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines, Citi and other leaders in the financial services sector joined CODE

(RED) to help get vaccines and other vital defenses to hundreds of millions of people in the world’s poorest countries. Citi provided

eligible U.S. credit card members with the option to donate their points to the CODE (RED) campaign. Citi also donated $250,000 to

(RED)’s efforts.

Affordable Housing

Citi finances affordable and

workforce housing in low- and

moderate-income urban and

suburban areas in an effort to

ease the affordable housing

crisis in the United States. We

offer a range of housing finance

solutions, including construction

lending, tax credit equity and

permanent financing through our

balance sheet.

Citi Community Capital, the bank unit

through which we finance all types of

affordable housing and community devel-

opment projects, reported approximately

$5.64 billion of lending to finance afford-

able rental housing projects in 2021. In

fact, for 12 consecutive years, Citi has been

the No. 1 affordable housing lender in the

United States, as published by Affordable

Housing Finance.

At Citi, being a leader in the affordable

housing industry does not just mean

making debt and equity capital available

to expand the U.S. affordable housing

supply; it also means being an innovator

and market leader. Over the past several

years we have worked with our clients to

find new ways to lower the cost of building

housing and increase the supply of housing

for our most vulnerable populations. For

example, Citi was among the first banks

to provide construction loans to projects

using modular, or factory-built, housing.

In 2021, we provided $19.6 million in total

financing for Oatsie’s Place, a new modular

housing project in Los Angeles, where

45 of 46 apartments are designated for

homeless women. In an effort to promote

long-term housing stability, eligible resi-

dents are provided with additional services

to support their transitions from homeless-

ness to permanent housing.

Citi also recently provided a $3.89 million
forward commitment for the permanent
financing of Hayu Tilixam, a 50-unit
apartment complex set to be built in
Portland, Oregon. Through a partnership
with Community Development Partners
and the Native American Youth and
Family Center, Hayu Tilixam will provide a
welcoming and culturally sensitive home
for Indigenous families and youth. All
units will be reserved for residents with
incomes between 30% to 50% of the area
median income, and eight units will be
reserved for formerly homeless residents.
Residents will have access to support
services, including housing stability
support, culturally-specific medical,
dental and behavioral health services,
homeownership coaching and more.
Our efforts around affordable housing are
consistent with our pledge to align commu-
nity engagement with SDG target 11.1 ,
which includes providing access for all to
adequate, safe and affordable housing
and basic services.

COMMUNITY PROGRESS MAKERS

In 2015, the Citi Foundation launched its Community Progress Makers Initiative with a vision of empowering community
leaders to grow their transformative impact through unrestricted, trust-based funding. That approach and support is
more important than ever as the United States continues to address the root causes and impacts of income and wealth
inequality.
In December 2021, the Foundation announced 50 nonprofit organizations as the newest recipients of unrestricted grants
to advance social and economic opportunity for underserved communities. The $25 million grant initiative supports
visionary organizations that are working to connect low-income communities and communities of color to greater social
and economic opportunity in six cities: Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, San Francisco and Washington, D.C. Each
Community Progress Maker will receive an unrestricted grant of $500,000 and access to technical assistance and a
facilitated supportive learning community.
The recipients are working on a range of social issues, including the expansion of affordable housing and access,
environmental sustainability, economic development, financial health and wellness, and workforce readiness/high-quality
jobs. The Foundation will provide a supportive community network through which these organizations can connect to
learn from each other, share best practices and strengthen their roles as social change agents. As part of the initiative,
the Citi Foundation is engaging longtime grantee Urban Institute to provide technical assistance to the cohort, helping to
measure their impact and track their progress.
According to a recent report from Citi Global Perspectives & Solutions, there is a growing need for multiyear,
unrestricted funding, which empowers nonprofits to invest in the financial sustainability of their organization and gives
them the flexibility to adapt to evolving challenges. This kind of philanthropic support is even more urgent as local
communities continue to face complex challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Return to Office and the Future

of Work

If the pandemic taught us anything from
an employee wellness perspective, it was
the value of flexibility. As the situation
surrounding the virus continued to evolve,
we focused on how we could bring our
colleagues safely back to the office. At the
same time, COVID-19 opened our minds to
new ways of working. While we know there
are enormous benefits to being together
in person, we saw just how productive
and effective remote work could be. We
recognized that we couldn’t go back to
the way things were and that we had to
adapt to new realities. After coming to
understand just how important flexibility
is to our current and future success as a
firm, we became the first major U.S. bank
to publicly embrace a hybrid model of work
for our colleagues moving forward.
As vaccinations became widely available
in the United States, United Kingdom and
other parts of the world, and where the
data told us it was safe to do so, we began
to bring colleagues back to the office in
a hybrid model — with a minimum of two
days per week in person and a few days
from home. Colleagues in more than 30
locations across the U.S. returned to the
office in 2021. We required colleagues
returning to those sites to be vaccinated
against COVID-19, wear masks and social
distance wherever possible. For colleagues
working in our branches, we required rapid
testing and masks in 2021, and vaccination
as of early 2022. Understanding there
is not a one-size-fits-all approach, we
adjusted our global return-to-office efforts
region by region, based on local data,
vaccine availability and country mandates.
Equally important, we communicated
regularly and consistently with our
colleagues — sending messages from our
CEO and senior leaders to keep people
informed of our plans to return to the
office and equipping our managers with
resources and information so that they, in
turn, could effectively support their teams
and answer questions.
After working from home became the
“new normal” in early 2020, we listened to
feedback from our employees and enacted
policies to help ease the blurring of lines
between home and work. In response, in
2021 we launched “Zoom-Free Fridays”
for internal meetings to combat the well-
recognized fatigue from virtual meetings.
We asked colleagues whenever they could to
designate noon to 1 p.m in local times as an
hour free of calls and meetings, as well as
to reduce hour-long meetings to 45 minutes
to give colleagues time in between sessions.
We also offered a “Reset Day” in May for
colleagues to take a day off to recharge
and added several new benefits to further
support work-life balance.
As the pandemic persisted

through 2021, we continued to put

the safety, health and well-being

of our colleagues first. Early on

in the health crisis, we developed

principles that have consistently

guided our decisions, including

how we returned to the office. We

focused on data, not dates, took

a localized approach, and were

transparent with colleagues that

we would continue to learn and

adapt as we go. Much of our atten-

tion was on creating a safe and

welcoming workplace for today,

while also pushing ourselves to

envision new ways of working for

tomorrow — a model that is more

flexible, agile and collaborative.

Despite the ongoing challenges

of the pandemic, we continued to

make progress on our commit-

ments to fostering a diverse and

inclusive workplace and using our

corporate voice to drive change.

Contents ESG at Citi Sustainable Finance Sustainable Progress Equitable & Resilient Communities Talent & DEI Risk Management & Responsible Business Appendices
CITI 2021 ESG REPORT 81
The Future of Work

One of the silver linings of the pandemic

was that our colleagues and teams learned

new and different ways of working when

the virus initially closed the doors of our

offices. At Citi, we felt it would be a missed

opportunity if we didn’t seize the moment

to reimagine the workplace once the

pandemic eases.

Our CEO, Jane Fraser, boldly embraced the

desire to be a bank with brains and a soul,

and to break out of the traditional mindset

that required our colleagues to be in the

office all day, every business day. We

established principles to guide our flexible,

future work model and related ways of

working — all with the aim to drive collabora-
tion and meaningful connections, maximize
apprenticeship and learning opportunities,
leverage technology to our advantage,
support colleague well-being and belonging,
and treat our colleagues equitably.
We announced this future work model will
take effect after colleagues return to the
office, and the model will provide hybrid,
remote and resident designations for
colleagues. Hybrid roles offer colleagues
the flexibility to work at least three days
per week in the office and up to two days
from home. The majority of Citi employ-
ees have been designated as hybrid.
Remote roles may be performed 100%
from outside the office location. Resident
roles are jobs that cannot be performed
remotely, such as tellers in our branches
and data center employees.
In 2022, we will roll out the future work
model and survey employees throughout
the early phases, using data to understand
what is working — and what isn’t — so we
can adapt where we need to. To support
hybrid and remote working, we have been
introducing enhanced technology and tools
that enable us to be more connected and
collaborative, no matter where we work.
The Benefit of Time

Having an opportunity to recharge or step away from work can boost job

productivity and morale. In 2021, we rolled out two new programs to do just

that for those who have been employed by Citi for at least five years.

Our “Refresh, Recharge, Reenergize” sabbatical program allows colleagues to

take up to 12 weeks away from work to pursue personal interests or education,

take extended travel or simply take time off. Employees will receive 25% of

their base pay, do not have to provide an explanation or reason for taking a

break, and are eligible for two sabbaticals during their full tenure at Citi. In

the first year of the program, which was launched in 2021, more than 200

employees began to take sabbatical.

Julie Berg, Head of Product and Segment Analytics, U.S. Consumer Analytics,

took advantage of the new program by driving coast-to-coast (and back again),

traveling more than 10,000 miles across 24 states with her dog, Hank, as her

CITI 2021 ESG REPORT 82

Diversity, Equity & Inclusion

Our workforce of more than

220,000 colleagues around

the globe reflects the diverse

backgrounds and perspectives

of our clients and customers.

This is why we ensure equity

and inclusion are embedded in

everything that we do.

Across the firm, there is tremendous

momentum to build on our efforts to

create a more diverse, equitable and inclu-

sive culture — from our pay equity work

to our representation goals to our diverse

interview panels and candidate slates to

our engagement with Historically Black

Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). We

believe in setting clear goals to measure

our progress and holding ourselves

accountable to building a company

where the best talent wants to work and

where people of all races, gender, sexual

orientation, disability status veteran status
or ethnicity can reach their full potential.
Our approach to diversity, equity and
inclusion (DEI) isn’t limited to broadening
the representation of those working within
the top levels of our own firm and creating
a more inclusive environment. We also look
at diversity holistically, thinking of ways to
widen our impact for our suppliers, clients,
customers and communities we serve. Learn
about our Action for Racial Equity plan to
help close the racial wealth gap and increase
economic mobility in the United States.
Pay Equity

We continue to disclose our adjusted
and unadjusted (or “raw”) pay gaps for
both women and U.S. minorities to hold
ourselves accountable for making progress.
The adjusted pay gap is a true measure of
pay equity, or “like for like,” that compares
the compensation of women to men and
U.S. minorities to non-minorities when
adjusting for factors such as job func-
tion, title/level and geography. The raw
gap measures the difference in median
compensation when we don’t adjust for any
of the aforementioned factors.
The existence of our raw pay gap reflects a
need to increase representation of women
and U.S. minorities in senior and higher-
paying roles.
Our latest results, released in early 2022,
found that, on an adjusted basis, women
globally are paid on average more than
99% of what men are paid at Citi, and
that there was no statistically significant
difference in adjusted compensation
for U.S. minorities and non-minorities.
Following the review, appropriate pay
adjustments were made as part of Citi’s
2021 compensation cycle.
The Interconnected Nature of Pay Gaps and Representation Goals

Citi was the first company to disclose adjusted pay results, and in 2019 we became one of the first companies to disclose our unadjusted or “raw” pay

gaps for both women and U.S. minorities. Being transparent about our median pay helped us achieve our firm-wide, aspirational representation goals in

By increasing representation of women and U.S. minorities in higher-compensated roles, we can continue to work toward closing the raw pay gaps.

CITI 2021 ESG REPORT 83

Citi’s 2021 raw gap analysis showed that

the median pay for women globally is

74% of the median for men, similar to

2020 and up from 73% in 2019 and 71% in

2018; the median pay for U.S. minorities

was more than 96% of the median for

non-minorities, which is up from just

under 94% in 2020, 94% in 2019 and

93% in 2018. Continuing to reduce our

raw pay gap requires that we increase

representation of women and U.S.

minorities in senior roles across the firm.

These pay equity reviews represent

a “moment in time” snapshot of our

employee base, which is constantly chang-

ing as people come in and out of the firm,

as colleagues are promoted and as market

dynamics change. We’re continuing to

innovate how we recruit and develop talent

and to use data more effectively to help us

increase diversity at more senior levels at

Citi. Our philosophy is that every member

of Citi’s team is responsible for progress

in making Citi an even more inclusive and

equitable workplace.

Citi collaborated with The Female Quotient,

a women-owned business dedicated to

advancing equality in the workplace, to

develop a free digital tool that provides

companies with a snapshot of their raw

pay gap. We view it as a way to further

equity across all types of companies and

see it as a concrete measure to increase

diversity more broadly. For more informa-

tion, visit The Female Quotient’s Advancing

Equality CalculatorTM.

Representation Goals

In 2018, we set aspirational representa-

tion goals to increase women leadership

globally and Black leadership in the United

States at the firm by the end of 2021. We

are pleased to share that Citi exceeded

these goals. Globally, we increased

representation at the Assistant Vice
President to Managing Director levels for
women to 40.6% (up from 37% in 2018),
and in the United States we increased
Black representation for those same
job levels to 8.1% (up from 6% in 2018).
Additionally, when we include colleagues in
the United States who self-identify as two
or more races, Black representation at the
same job levels increased to 9.1%.
Our commitment doesn’t stop here, and we
recognize there’s still work to do to build a
more diverse, equitable and inclusive firm.
We will build and expand on our representa-
tion goals in the future and will continue to
be transparent while holding ourselves
accountable. Diversity, equity and inclusion
factors, including the representation of
women and racial/ethnic minorities, continue
to be included in senior executives’ score-
cards. Learn more in the ESG at Citi section.
Pipeline analyses help us assess the avail-
ability and flow of diverse talent at Citi and
how we can achieve better representation
among women and racial/ethnic minori-
ties. Such analyses also play an important
role in succession planning at Citi, ensuring
that we have diversity of employees who
are ready for promotion now, and that we
have appropriate development plans for
those who would be ready for promotion
in several years. Intentionality in talent
development is essential if we’re going
to elevate more women and racial/ethnic
minorities to high-level positions at Citi —
and across our industry as a whole.
According to McKinsey & Company, there’s
a strong business case for gender and
racial diversity in corporate leadership,
with the most diverse companies outper-
forming their peers on profitability. A
report issued by McKinsey^1 in 2020 found
that companies in the top quartile for
gender diversity on executive teams were
25% more likely to have above-average
profitability than companies in the fourth
quartile. That’s up from 21% in 2017 and
15% in 2014.
Our representation goals, as well as other
work we are doing around gender equality
in the workplace, directly contribute to
SDG 5 in support of gender equality
and empowering all women and girls.
Specifically, we are enabling progress
toward target 5.5 , which aims to ensure
women’s full and effective participation
and equal opportunities for leadership at
all levels of decision-making in political,
economic and public life.

and women-owned businesses in our

CITI 2021 ESG REPORT 84

A Roadmap for Black Equity

In November 2021, we announced our participation in the Management Leadership for Tomorrow (MLT) Black Equity at Work
Certification — a first-of-its-kind standard and roadmap for employers that want to achieve Black equity internally while support-
ing Black equity in society. Citi was the first major Wall Street bank to sign on. Our participation complements our Action for
Racial Equity efforts, including our commitment to conduct a third-party racial equity audit. (Learn more in the Equitable and
Resilient Communities section.)
MLT’s unique accreditation program calls on corporations to take a stand for Black equity and provides a critical resource
for employers to make progress toward their Black equity goals. Through our participation in this program, Citi will receive
MLT’s expertise, counsel and feedback on our internal Black equity initiatives and practices, including how we can increase
Black representation, drive equal pay and invest in Black equity causes. The validation process will help Citi develop a robust,
comprehensive plan that will enable us to achieve a Black Equity at Work Certification in one to three years.
DIVERSITY AT THE
EXECUTIVE LEVEL
Gender equity is something we
demonstrate from the very top
of our organization. Jane Fraser
is our first woman CEO — and
was the first woman to lead a
major Wall Street bank. Based
on existing self-identification
data, five (29%) of our 17-person
Executive Management Team
are women and six (35%) are
racially/ethnically diverse. As
of April 25, 2022, eight (53%)
of the 15 members of our Board
of Directors are women and
three (20%) are racial/ethnic
minorities. Citi was among the
first financial services firms
to achieve gender parity on
its Board.

Recruit, Retain and

Promote

We are committed to continue building a

team that is inclusive and representative

of our customers and clients. To make

progress, we have been evolving the way

we bring new colleagues into Citi, including

accelerating the use of diverse slates in our

recruiting and deepening our capabilities to

measure our success.

In 2021, we expanded the use of diverse

slates in our recruiting to have at least two

women and/or U.S. minorities in our inter-

views for U.S. hires and at least two women

in our interviews for global hires. These

include candidates at various senior levels,

from Assistant Vice President to Managing

Director. As of December, nearly 75% of

roles that were posted globally included a

diverse slate of candidates with at least two

women and/or two U.S. minorities. In 2021,

we launched a Diversity Sourcing team in

the United States to consistently identify

diverse talent in the marketplace and

accelerate our hiring of diverse talent.

We have expanded engagement with exter-

nal partners, including diversity professional

organizations. These relationships have

enhanced our ability to attract and hire mid-

to senior-level talent demonstrating Citi’s

inclusive culture.

Campus Recruiting

Our campus recruiting program is another
important way for us to diversify our
employee base, and we have a robust
pipeline of talent from HBCUs and other
leading universities.
- Our Citi® University Partnerships
in Innovation & Discovery (CUPID)
Program enables us to accelerate inno-
vation projects across Citi by engaging
diverse students and developing a
robust, diverse pipeline of talent from
leading universities (see callout above).
- In 2021, we held our third annual
HBCU Innovation and Leadership
Symposium , which brought together

42 first- and second-year students
(58% first years and 32% sophomores)
from 15 HBCUs for an introductory,
virtual experience focused on helping
them understand financial services,
gain technical skills and kick off the
career-planning process. While we
would like the students to consider
the possibility of a future with Citi, our
primary goal is to provide them with
helpful tools on their path to profes-
sional success, without regard for
industry or profession.
- Our Early Insights Programs for
college students in their first and
second years of undergraduate studies
are focused on identifying, mentoring
and hiring top diverse talent for
summer analyst programs across the
firm. These programs provide early
exposure to, and education around,
Citi’s businesses, technical training,
mentorship and culture.
- Our Freshman Discovery Day is a
two-day exploratory program that
helps educate underrepresented
minority college freshmen about the
various roles in financial services.

MILITARY OFFICER LEADERSHIP PROGRAM

Our Military Officer Leadership Program (MOLP) focuses on recruiting,
developing, training and preparing transitioning service members for mid- to
senior-level leadership roles at Citi. Over a two-year time period, candidates
rotate three times, giving them a peer network of mentorship and support
and a path to a successful career at Citi. “As a former combat veteran, with
no direct experience in the financial industry, the MOLP was a great opportu-
nity,” said Rob Carter, a graduate of the program who has been with Citi for
about five years. “The exposure to different businesses allowed me to find
an area within the firm that leveraged the skills I developed during my time
in the Army,” says Carter, Senior Vice President in Human Resources and
one of the more than 2,400 U.S. employees who have disclosed their veteran
status to us.
CUPID BY THE NUMBERS

The Citi® University Partnerships in Innovation & Discovery (CUPID) Program
embeds students from top universities in innovation activities across Citi.
CUPID students — many of them underrepresented minorities — gain exposure
to various aspects of our business and help us develop a robust, diverse
pipeline of talent. Since we launched CUPID in 2017, we have:
Engaged 3,600+ students and early career professionals
Hired 202 CUPID participants
Hired 43 HBCU students
Worked with 90 colleges and universities, including 38 HBCUs
Hosted 40 events, such as hackathons, competitions and symposiums

platforms that attract diverse students,

enabling our recruiters to communicate

and engage with students to promote job

opportunities. We were also honored to

receive the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion

Award and received an Honorable Mention

for Recruiting Excellence from the National

Association of Colleges and Employers.

Developing Diverse Talent

Hiring, promoting and retaining more

women and racial/ethnic minorities in

senior, high-paying roles is critical to our

success — and key to helping solve the

two-pronged issue of representation and

pay equity. Career development is one of

our top priorities, and we promote from

within to continue developing our existing

talent. In 2021, 41% of open positions at
Citi were filled with internal candidates.
“Owning My Success” (OMS), for example,
is a group coaching program for Black
colleagues that provides exposure to
Citi’s senior leadership and supports
professional and personal development.
More than 700 Black colleagues have
participated in OMS since the program
began in 2018. Over the course of several
months, participants join group coaching
circles, led by an external executive coach
and a senior leader at Citi. Managers of the
participants also take part in group coach-
ing to better understand the experience of
Black colleagues in the workplace.

Citi Personal Banking & Wealth

Management and our Risk and Controls

group each piloted advocacy programs for

underrepresented talent in 2021, pairing

participants with senior leaders to offer

career advice and support. Black Leaders

for Tomorrow, an initiative within the

Institutional Clients Group, also offers an

Advocacy program for Black directors.

More than 600 Black employees each year

participate in one of five programs offered

through Black Leaders for Tomorrow.

We also launched the Black Managing

Director Engagement initiative, a quar-

terly small group gathering of Executive

Management Team members and Black

Managing Directors who get to know each

other, share ideas on ways to enhance Citi’s

strategy and discuss opportunities for

personal and professional growth.

Our Role-Based Assessment Program,

meanwhile, focuses on building a robust

succession plan for our Black and women

leaders. The career development program

includes executive assessment and coach-

ing. In 2021, 31 high-performing Black and

women Managing Directors and Directors

were selected for the program.

We provide a range of internal development

and rotational programs for leaders at all

levels, and we continued to evolve our learn-

ing programs to meet new needs. Our Citi

Women’s Leadership Development Program

was held remotely in 2021, bringing together

a group of Senior Vice Presidents and

Directors from around the world to network

and develop leadership skills.

In Latin America, our Women’s Virtual

Development Program continues to be one

of our most valued in the region, with more

than 1,600 participants in 2021. Across

Asia Pacific, 780 participants joined one of

four programs supporting women as they

transition to more senior roles. And in Europe,

for our “reverse mentoring” program, we

paired senior leaders from the region with

junior mentors from the LGBTQ+ community.
The goal of the program, which was subse-
quently rolled out in Latin America, Asia
Pacific and the United States, was to educate
the mentees about the lived experience of
their LGBTQ+ colleagues.
To better support our colleagues with
disabilities, we made enhancements to
our tools and resources to build a more
inclusive workplace, including a strong
team of doctors, digital accessibility
experts and accommodations specialists.
The Global Consumer Technology team
launched a partnership with Neurodiverse
Solutions (formerly Autism2Work), and in
May 2021, the team added five contractors
who have autism spectrum disorder, or
ASD, to the Global Consumer Bank ATM
team based in our Florence, Kentucky,
ATM Lab. After seeing such strong results
in just six months, the Neurodiverse
Solutions program has expanded across
Citi with 12 contractors and plans to
grow the team to 50 contractors by
the end of 2022. Citi recently began a
partnership with Disability:IN, a global
nonprofit resource for disability inclusion.
Disability:IN partners with over 400
companies worldwide with the vision to
create an inclusive global economy where
people with disabilities participate fully
and meaningfully.
PARTNERSHIP WITH THE EXECUTIVE LEADERSHIP COUNCIL

We invest in career development and planning for diverse talent through
mentorship, networking, rotational programs and partnerships, such as our
longstanding relationship with The Executive Leadership Council (ELC). In
2021, we signed a million-dollar, multiyear agreement with ELC to enhance our
investment in Black leadership and establish a cohesive development journey
and continuum for Citi’s Black leaders. Through this partnership, Citi plans
to help develop 850 mid- to senior-level employees over three years. The
program is focused on Black colleagues at the Assistant Vice President through
Managing Director levels who are tapped for further development at Citi.
The intent is to invest in their continued professional growth and mobility by
providing personalized coaching and greater exposure to senior-level leaders.
The Black Women at Citi Power Panel, presented by Black Women at Citi and Citi Inspires,
was a successful hybrid event in 2021, with 3,300 colleagues tuning in. A panel of senior
Black women at the firm discussed mental health, work/life balance, self-advocacy, building
community, sponsorship and career development. Following the panel, our Chief Diversity,
Equity and Inclusion Officer and Global Head of Talent, Erika Irish Brown, hosted a fireside
chat with Grammy-award winner Gladys Knight.

Inclusion

Inclusive practices and policies lead to

improved business performance and a

company culture where employees feel

welcome, safe and respected, and where

they can focus on their work without fear

of prejudice or discrimination. We work

hard to establish a strong DEI foundation

for the company at all levels, creating

paths for the next generation of leaders

across every dimension of diversity.

We want all of our colleagues to feel

empowered to share all aspects of their

identity so that we may continue to honor

what makes them diverse and unique while

also strengthening a culture that values
and promotes diverse perspectives.
Core to our data-driven approach is
gaining better understanding of how
our employees self-identify so that we
can better meet their needs. In 2021
we launched a global Self-ID campaign
to nearly 190,000 employees (90%
of our workforce), who were invited to
self-identify their race and ethnicity,
gender identities, sexual orientation,
disability status and military status, as
permissible by local laws and regulations
in the 46 countries we survey. For 2021,
we expanded the sexual orientation
dimension from 15 to 34 countries and the
race and ethnicity dimension from 18 to
31 countries. Additionally, we continued to
encourage the reporting of multiple races/
ethnicities for those employees who self-
identify as such by enabling the selection
of specific races/ethnicities. We achieved
a response rate of nearly 100% for global
gender and U.S. race/ethnicity.

mation about our workforce composition.

Our Employee Networks in Action: 2021

Our Employee Network chapters serve as local representatives of our Affinities. Initiated and led by colleagues at
our work sites, the Networks offer professional development, mentoring, networking and community engagement
opportunities to members and colleagues. Consistent with our inclusive culture, Employee Network chapters are open
to all Citi employees, regardless of whether they identify with a particular Affinity. Each of our nine Affinities is co-led
by a member of our CEO’s leadership team. The number of our global Employee Network chapters increased from 198
in 2020 to 226 in 2021, while the total number of unique members in the groups increased from 21,420 to 26,950
globally. The following are some examples of our colleagues’ experiences from participating in our Affinities.
I always feel my intersectionality

being a woman, an Asian and an

immigrant is celebrated at Citi,

and my perspectives are valued

by my co-workers. I received

overwhelming support from

our senior leaders when I first

approached them with the idea to

initiate an Asian Heritage Network

in Canada. Working remotely and

separated from families during

the pandemic have been very

challenging for many in the Asian

communities, who experienced or

witnessed race-based abuse, hate

and even violence. Citi’s Affinity

networks have created a safe

space for us to share emotions and

offer support to each other. Being

able to support my community at

work adds a sense of purpose and

belonging for me.”

In addition to learning even more about my own culture as a part
of the Black Heritage Network, I have also been able to expand
my network, increase my exposure to Citi leaders and focus on
career development through many of the lessons learned from the
network’s events and sessions. This is also true regarding all of
the employee networks sponsored by Citi. Citi truly exemplifies
a diverse, equitable and inclusive culture through the Employee
Network program and through the act of investing in cultures and
communities within and beyond our Citi walls.”

America Service Initiative groups. I started off small by taking on
volunteer responsibilities such as our USO Bike Build and Thank
You Card events, and with each new opportunity I was able to
meet so many unique people who also wanted to help veterans. I
am proud to serve as the Citi Salutes New York Chapter co-chair
and always look forward to working with our other New York-based
networks.”

Our Employee Networks in Action: 2021 (continued)

Citi Women Networks in Asia had a
momentous year with many key initiatives
and successful program launches. For
example, here in China we launched a
maternity buddy program that received
overwhelmingly positive reviews from those
who participated. We also partnered with
other networks to lead November Gratitude
Month, where we sent out 8,000 thank you
cards to employees and staff, building on
our already strong sense of community and
showcasing our leadership principle of ‘We
Succeed Together.’ Citi Women has brought
tremendous value to my own experience
and to Citi overall by creating an inclusive
culture for women to thrive.”
The Networks have the incredible mission to not only
act upon the specific themes of each of the diversity
groups, but also to expand the overall engagement
and awareness among our population — creating an
environment for empathy, connection and ‘call to
action.’ In that sense, Families Matter provides us
the amazing opportunity to work across Affinities:
learning, supporting and acting together, especially
in a moment when work, home and families are more
intertwined than ever before. Understanding the
realities and particularities of our diverse team and
acting together with other Affinities allows us to
support our Citi family.”
I was originally approached to join London Disability Network in
2006 and found a fantastic group of folks looking to ensure that
anyone with a disability, injury or illness felt that they had a voice.
I went on to serve as co-chair for the London Disability Network
on two occasions, where I believe we enhanced representation,
engaged with senior management and weaved Inclusion into the
business conversation. I am a firm believer that as an employee
I need to set an example on how, with the right level of support
from my amazing managers over the years, I was able to grow
my career and begin to ask not what Citi can do for me, but
what can I do for Citi and the disability community. I have been
working with various groups and technology experts to raise the
understanding on how assistive technology enables inclusion. By
being myself, I have allowed my managers to be their very best for
me, and together we can work on what we need to do to support
our clients.”
I have been with the firm for almost a decade, and I
am really proud of how we have stepped up in recent
years to strategize on diversity, equity and inclusion
efforts to create an inclusive culture at Citi. Our
colleagues who participated in Network initiatives
continuously share feedback that they experience
great value and learnings from our content. I am
especially fond of sessions where safe spaces are
created to speak up. Inviting people to talk about
topics relating to diversity, equity and inclusion
increases awareness so we can break down barriers
and enable people to be comfortable with certain
topics. This helps create an understanding of the role
we can all play in supporting one another.”

Our Employee Networks in Action: 2021 (continued)

I raised my hand to be part of the

Hispanic/Latino Heritage network

shortly after joining Citi in 2018

as a Senior Executive Assistant.

I hadn’t met many colleagues

who looked like me in my office,

and the Network has provided

me with a sense of community.

Working closely with our Hispanic/

Latino Affinity leadership on a

membership drive initiative, the

group I began to work with brings

co-chairs from all of our 11 chapters

in the United States and United

Kingdom together on a monthly

cadence, where we exchange ideas

collectively. This leadership role

has allowed me to hone my public

speaking and presentation skills,

as well as pursue opportunities to

develop a network of connections

I wouldn’t have otherwise

encountered. I’m certain it has

prepared me for my role as a

recently promoted Assistant Vice

President.”

The value I’ve gotten from the Pride Network is the ability to
see not only tangible and measurable results from our network’s
projects as we progressed, but also the positive and proactive
feedback from folks who have benefited from our efforts. Hearing
from both senior leaders and LGBTQ+ people on their beneficial
experiences and how this has impacted their work lives has
made all the difference. Being able to connect with colleagues
from other regions, learn from each other and work together has
been a great experience. Specifically, being able to lead the Citi
SpeakOUT project with other colleagues from North America and
Latin America has been one of the best experiences I’ve had at
Citi. Providing access to opportunities for development, such as
the Out & Equal Summit and the LGBTQ+ Development Program,
are just some of the many ways we support one another. ”

Voice of the Employee

Our annual Voice of the Employee (VOE) survey provides valuable insights regarding employee engagement and perceptions about

our firm — our successes as well as our pain points. In 2021, participation was high — 87% of colleagues globally responded.

We heard employees are embracing the Leadership Principles we rolled out in March, with all three principles approaching 90%

favorability. Overall, 91% of employees said they are proud to work for Citi and felt that our commitments to an ethical culture and

diversity are strong.

Nearly 90% of employees said their managers promote diversity, equity and inclusion on their teams. But many colleagues are looking

for their managers to provide greater support in their career development — a perennial area for improvement across the firm.

While colleagues gave us high marks for our response to COVID-19, employees shared they are feeling the strain of life during the

pandemic and increased workloads. These feelings were especially acute among our women colleagues. Their responses have reaffirmed

the importance of our efforts, and we will continue to address this feedback to help relieve stress, simplify our working processes,

develop tools for collaboration and ensure that our managers continue to support their people.

CITI 2021 ESG REPORT 96

Using Our Corporate Voice

to Drive Change

At Citi, we believe we can use our

power as a global bank to effect

social change, and we continue

to take a stand on a wide range

of issues, such as racial and pay

equity, immigration, gun violence

and climate change. We also

believe it’s important to speak

up and speak out on issues that

impact our colleagues.

For example, in the United States in 2021,

there was an alarming rise in bills proposed

at the state level that would single out

LGBTQ+ individuals for exclusion or differ-

ential treatment. Legislation promoting

discrimination could negatively impact our

colleagues and their families, as well as our

clients, customers and our business. In May,

Citi signed the Human Rights Campaign’s

Business Statement Opposing Anti-LGBTQ+

State Legislation, reiterating our belief

that all people have a fundamental right

to equality and our opposition to harmful

legislation aimed at restricting the access

of LGBTQ+ people in society.

Citi has a long history of outspoken advo-

cacy for the LGBTQ+ community. In 2020,

Citi became the first major bank to provide

transgender and nonbinary customers with

the ability to have account profiles and

credit cards that match their chosen first

name. Since the initial launch, more than

18,000 consumers have updated their Citi

U.S. branded credit cards with their chosen

name. Learn more in the Serving Our

Customers and Clients Responsibly section.

When members of the Asian American

and Pacific Islander (AAPI) community

endured rising instances of violence in

response to the pandemic, our Executive

Management Team condemned the xeno-
phobia while voicing support for our AAPI
colleagues and the broader community.
We also held internal listening sessions
and hosted community forums to show our
support for our employees. Watch a public
service message we produced. We hosted
a “Hollaback Bystander Intervention”
training, which is designed to provide
colleagues with practical tactics on how to
intervene in a safe way if they witness an
incident in public. In 2021, we hosted three
sessions, and more than 500 colleagues
joined the training. We plan to host addi-
tional sessions in 2022.
We also expanded our partnership with
Ascend, a non-profit organization focused
on professional development of the AAPI
community, and sponsored the Ascend
National Convention week, which more
than 200 colleagues attended.
Furthermore, Citi was one of many U.S.
businesses that condemned efforts in
2021 to restrict voting access in the state
of Georgia. We opposed voting restriction
laws because we believed it would “under-
mine the ability of Americans to avail
themselves of this fundamental right.”
For 17 consecutive years, Citi
has received a perfect score on
the Human Rights Campaign
Foundation’s Corporate Equality
Index, a national survey that
benchmarks corporate policies
and practices for LGBTQ+
workplace quality.
MARKING HOLIDAYS OF SIGNIFICANCE

Starting in 2022, we have a new paid holiday for U.S. employees: Juneteenth
Day, a federal holiday that marks the end of slavery. We also had the
opportunity to be more inclusive and acknowledge Indigenous Peoples Day in
addition to Columbus Day. In 2020, Citi implemented one additional floating
holiday called Heritage Day, which employees can take at any time to honor a
day of personal signficance.

We strive to maintain an environment in which development opportunities are
widely available, where people are hired and advanced on their merits and where
our employees treat each other with respect. We are fully committed to equal
employment opportunities, fair employment practices and nondiscrimination.

Our Transformation

Through our transformation we

are working to modernize and

simplify the bank so that we can

better manage risk, improve our

service to customers and clients

and make Citi an easier place to

work. Through the modernization

of our data infrastructure and

operations, and by evolving our

culture, we are strengthening

our safety and soundness as a

bank and improving our ability to

compete in the digital age.

Transforming Our

Risk and Control

Environment

In October 2020, the Federal Reserve

Board and the Office of the Comptroller

of the Currency issued consent orders to

Citi requiring improvements in the way we

manage enterprise-wide risk, compliance,

data and internal controls. This, combined

with an increasingly competitive land-

scape and our clients’ acceleration toward

digital solutions through the pandemic,

became the catalyst for Citi’s transforma-

tion strategy.

Citi has been in operation for more than

200 years. But our transformation isn’t

about looking back; it’s about looking

ahead, to become an even stronger bank for

all our stakeholders. This transformation is

an interconnected, enterprise-wide effort.

In addition to remediating issues, we are

addressing root causes, simplifying the way

we operate and doing so more effectively.

We are redesigning our key processes from

end to end, automating them and ensuring

we have the proper controls in place while

eliminating complexity.

Governance and

Leadership

Putting the right teams and governance in
place is critical to creating consistency in
our approach across the firm and driving
the ultimate success of our transformation.
Our Transformation Steering Committee,
chaired by our CEO, sets the overall
direction for our transformation efforts
and communicates progress to our Board
of Directors, as well as seeks input and
feedback from the Board. In addition,
one or more members of our Executive
Management Team lead program groups
that are central to our transformation. To
encourage enterprise-wide engagement,
each of these groups includes representa-
tion from across our businesses and func-
tions. The executives in charge of these
programs are held accountable for their
group’s success, and their compensation is
linked to achieving results.
Senior leaders are setting the tone for
their teams, showing a high level of
engagement with, and commitment to, our
transformation activities.
OUR DATA GOVERNANCE PROGRAM

Data quality is one of the areas of focus for our transformation. To lead this
effort, we have established a Data Governance Program to elevate our data
governance and to help drive necessary improvements to our technology and
processes. Our goal is to make it easier to locate, collect and use the infor-
mation our colleagues need to do their jobs and mitigate risk.
In 2021, we rewrote our Citi Data Governance Policy (which governs how we
manage and use our data) to be more concise, provide greater clarity and
embed accountability across the firm. The policy clarifies and simplifies the
way we govern data, with a focus on achieving access to trusted, high-quality
data in a controlled way.
Contents ESG at Citi Sustainable Finance Sustainable Progress Equitable & Resilient Communities Talent & DEI Risk Management & Responsible Business Appendices

CITI 2021 ESG REPORT 104

Our Path to Transformation

To establish a baseline for our transforma-

tion strategy, we conducted a gap analysis

exercise, started in 2020 and completed

in 2021, to review the issues raised in the

consent orders and define the gap between

where we were and where we need to be.

Following the gap analysis, we designed a

roadmap to get us to our target state. The

roadmap comprises several distinct areas

that feed into Citi’s integrated vision of

transformation for our company.

One of the first actions we undertook in

2021 was to develop and roll out a new

Enterprise Risk Management Framework to

assess risk across our enterprise. The inte-

grated approach of the framework seeks to

drive consistency across key areas of risk,

strengthening the way the firm identifies,

measures and monitors risk so that we

can implement appropriate controls and

reporting mechanisms. The framework

helps bring consistency and structure to
the varied types of risks we face across
Citi — leading to better scenario-planning,
stress testing and root-cause analyses
across the risk lifecycle.
All colleagues are empowered to apply the
Enterprise Risk Management Framework
to their work and are responsible for
promptly escalating risk-related concerns.
We rolled out training on the new frame-
work to all employees globally in 2021, and
98% completed the training by the end of
the year.
We are also developing standards, plans
and training curricula for a more modern,
streamlined approach to our control envi-
ronment, which we will be implementing in
future years. For example, we are ensuring
that when incidents arise, our employees
can conduct robust root-cause analyses
and then apply the lessons learned hori-
zontally across the organization to prevent
similar issues from arising elsewhere.
In addition, we are working to simplify,
streamline and automate our controls —
strengthening our ability to prevent issues,
not just to detect them after they arise.
To empower our employees and increase
the effectiveness of their day-to-day work,
we are undertaking a full update of our
policies to make them easier to under-
stand and take action against. We’re also
planning to migrate our policies to a new
platform in 2023, making them easier to
access and navigate.
During 2021, we continued to build teams
focused on transformation activities
across the company. These teams are
a hybrid of employees with a depth of
institutional knowledge and newer employ-
ees who bring diverse expertise and
perspectives.

management and our control environ-

ment. We believe this will allow us to build

a culture of excellence in which we each

take ownership for managing risk and

controls and where we continue to take

pride in working together to always do

the right thing for our clients, colleagues

and communities.

To achieve this, we introduced a new set

of Leadership Principles in 2021, to help

us embed the behaviors and conditions

we need in order to sustain the changes

we are making as part of our transfor-

mation. To further embed the Leadership

Principles, Citi is deploying a three-year,

firm-wide culture change program,

designed to change the way we work by

introducing small, everyday habits that

we can all adopt to make Citi a stronger,

simpler and more enjoyable place to work.

We are working to ensure that we have the

right number of employees with the right

skills in place to achieve risk and control

excellence, and that we use our employee

development programs, promotion and

performance management processes and

compensation to reinforce and incentivize

that excellence. Our compensation struc-

ture captures individual impacts on risk

and control, and each of our employees

has a related performance goal they are

working toward.

Ethics and Culture

at Citi

Each of our employees shares a common
responsibility to earn and maintain our
clients’ trust by applying our values and
principles every day, to everything they
do, wherever Citi operates. We expect our
employees to prioritize excellence — for our
clients, in our operations, and in our risk
and controls environment — and to provide
our products, services and expertise in
a systemically responsible manner, while
complying with all applicable laws, regu-
lations and Citi policies. To reinforce this,
we establish and communicate our core
values and principles through our Mission
and Value Proposition, our Leadership
Principles, Citi’s Code of Conduct, various
training and development opportunities,
employee engagement initiatives and
communications from our senior leaders.
Tone from the Top

We foster a culture of ethics through
our governance framework, programs
and efforts that embed our culture and
expectations for behavior throughout
the organization. Our approach begins
with a strong “tone from the top,” start-
ing with our Board of Directors. With
oversight from the Ethics, Conduct and
Culture Committee of the Board, our
senior leaders consistently reinforce a
culture of ethics, appropriate conduct and
accountability within the organization, and
empower our employees to make ethical
decisions, escalate issues and adhere to
Citi’s standards of conduct.
WE ASK OUR COLLEAGUES GLOBALLY TO ENSURE THAT THEIR
DECISIONS PASS THREE TESTS:
They are in our clients’ interests.
They create economic value.
They are always systemically responsible.
These three tests help our colleagues to responsibly deliver on our core
activities of safeguarding assets, lending money, making payments and
accessing capital markets on behalf of our clients — each of which creates an
obligation to act with integrity, to do everything possible to create the best
outcomes for our clients, and to prudently manage risk. The tests demon-
strate our commitment to using good judgment and taking pride in doing the
right thing — even when it’s not the easiest thing.

CITI 2021 ESG REPORT 106

Acting with Integrity

We empower our employees to do what’s

right by setting clear expectations through

our Mission and Value Proposition,

Leadership Principles and Code of

Conduct, as well as by providing the tools

and resources our employees need to act

ethically, along with clear information

about the various resources available to

escalate concerns.

Code of Conduct

Citi’s Code of Conduct outlines the

standards of ethics and professional

behavior expected of employees and

representatives of Citi when dealing

with clients, business colleagues,

shareholders, communities and each

other. It also provides an overview of key

legal and regulatory requirements and

select global policies.

Our Code reinforces for employees that

Citi’s culture is one in which we take

pride in always doing the right thing, hold

ourselves and each other accountable, and

feel comfortable and equipped to promptly

escalate concerns about actual or potential

misconduct. It also reflects Citi’s ongoing

commitment to fostering a culture of diver-

sity and inclusion — one in which doing the

right thing includes showing empathy for

our colleagues, clients and communities;

treating each other with respect and civility;

and continuing to invest in colleagues from

all backgrounds.

Citi’s Code of Conduct applies to all

directors, officers and employees of Citi

worldwide. Upon joining Citi, employees

must acknowledge that they have read and

will comply with our Code. To best serve

our global workforce, we publish our Code

of Conduct in 21 languages and make it

publicly available on our Investor Relations

website. Individuals performing services

for Citi may also be subject to our Code

by contract or agreement. As explicitly

stated in our Code, violations can result

in disciplinary action up to and including
termination of employment or other rela-
tionship with Citi.
We provide Code of Conduct training to
new hires globally when they join Citi,
as well as to nonemployee contingent
workers performing services for Citi at
their time of onboarding. In addition, we
ask employees and contingent workers to
periodically reaffirm their commitment to
our Code through required Code of Conduct
training. The training includes hypothetical
work-related ethical scenarios that focus
on making good decisions and performing
our work in a way that is consistent with
Citi’s values, culture, applicable laws, and
Citi policies, standards and procedures. The
training includes hypothetical work-related
situations that allow employees to practice
ethical decision-making and reinforce key
concepts from our Code of Conduct, Mission
and Value Proposition and our Leadership
Principles. Like our Code of Conduct, the
training emphasizes employees’ obligation
to promptly report actual or suspected
misconduct and provides information on
the various resources available to them to
do so.
Leadership Principles

In early 2021, we launched a new set of
Leadership Principles that reflect the
behaviors and expectations we have for
ourselves in line with our transformation
to become a better, stronger bank. We
encourage all employees to demonstrate
the Leadership Principles in all that they do.
Holding ourselves and each other to these
high standards is part of our culture and
our commitment to operating in our clients’
best interests, driving economic value and
managing risk.
We expect managers to lead by example
and inspire their employees to live Citi’s
values. Every manager is responsible for
creating a work environment that is free of
Citi’s Leadership Principles

These principles represent the qualities, behaviors and expectations we all must
exhibit to deliver on our mission of enabling growth and economic progress. They
will contribute to creating a culture that drives client excellence, controls excel-
lence and operational excellence.
We take ownership: Challenging each other to high standards and welcoming
that challenge; greeting change with optimism, curiosity and resilience; speaking
with candor; learning from experience; and contributing to and honoring group
decisions
We deliver with pride: Striving for excellence across our business; simplifying,
standardizing and clarifying our work; holding ourselves and others accountable
for managing risk; fixing root causes of problems; and taking pride in doing the
right thing
We succeed together: Valuing and learning from different perspectives; breaking
down barriers; measuring performance through a stakeholder lens; investing in
colleagues from all backgrounds; and showing empathy for our colleagues, clients
and communities.

discrimination, harassment and retaliation.

Managers are expected to reinforce the

importance of following our Leadership

Principles, Code of Conduct and Mission

and Value Proposition, as well as to

encourage employees to speak up and

raise any concerns about potential legal

or ethical issues. Managers must properly

resolve or promptly escalate concerns

through appropriate channels, promote

awareness of all resources available for

reporting concerns and neither engage in,

nor tolerate, retaliation of any kind.

Escalating Business and

Ethical Concerns

Each member of our workforce plays a crit-

ical role in escalating business and ethical

concerns so that they can be addressed

quickly and effectively. Citi’s Code of

Conduct emphasizes the principle that,

when in doubt, employees should always err

on the side of escalation. Our Code provides

an overview of the types of misconduct

and concerns that require escalation and

the resources available to employees for

prompt escalation of concerns, as well

as a link to the full Citi Escalation Policy,

which provides even more information for

employees about escalation requirements

and resources.

As part of Citi’s escalation resources, the

Ethics Hotline provides multiple channels

for employees and any third party, includ-

ing members of the general public, to

report concerns about unethical behavior

to Citi’s Ethics Office. In addition to internal

and public-facing websites (enhanced in

January 2022 with upgraded features)

that facilitate submission of concerns, a

telephone line is available 24 hours a day,

seven days a week, with live operators

who can connect to translators in multiple

languages.

We believe it is essential that individuals

feel secure when raising a concern. All

contacts to the Ethics Office and Ethics
Office investigations are treated as
confidentially as possible, consistent with
the need to investigate and address the
matter, and subject to applicable laws and
regulations. Concerns may be raised either
anonymously or with attribution, subject
to applicable laws and regulations. Further,
Citi prohibits any form of retaliation against
anyone who raises a concern or question
regarding ethics, discrimination or harass-
ment matters, as well as against anyone
who participates in a subsequent investiga-
tion. Employees who engage in retaliation
against a colleague because they raised a
concern or question, asked for a reasonable
accommodation, reported a violation or
was involved in an investigation are subject
to disciplinary action, up to and including
termination of employment or other rela-
tionship with Citi.
ASSESSING OUR CULTURE OF ETHICS

Hearing from employees is one important way we assess the strength of ethics
and accountability across our company. As part of Citi’s annual Voice of the
Employee survey, we include an Ethical Culture Index to gather feedback from
employees about the following items:
Comfort with reporting unethical practices without fear of reprisal
A feeling of accountability to identify and escalate issues
Confidence that Citi will act upon reported legal or ethical violations
A belief that colleagues act with integrity
Manager encouragement of ethical conduct even in the face of pressure
In dex results stayed stable in 2021, with 91% of our employees responding
positively to the index. We will continue to listen to our employees and raise
the bar in this area.
Staying on Top of Your Ethical Game

Through our global Ethical Fitness Challenge, led by our Executive Management
Team, we provided employees with the equipment they needed to get in their
best ethical shape. Through this campaign, we released a series of eight modules
over three years, incorporating senior leader videos, case studies and knowledge
checks, as well as support to help managers guide conversations around each
topic. Each part in the series highlighted a different element of ethical fitness,
such as behavior rationalization, the importance of speaking up, misplaced loyalty
and finding clarity in ethical situations. This campaign concluded in 2021, with
a required training for all employees to consolidate and reinforce key themes
presented over the course of the campaign.

TRANSPARENCY FOR EMPLOYEES

Annual Ethics Hotline Summary

Each year, the Citi Ethics Office provides all employees with a summary of the types of concerns received through
the Ethics Hotline and the types of corrective actions that may arise from substantiated concerns. This summary
demonstrates that the Ethics Hotline process is used by our colleagues globally and that raising concerns to the Citi
Ethics Office leads to meaningful action within our organization, such as disciplinary action, termination of vendor
relationships, referrals to law enforcement or governmental authorities, employee communications, additional training,
control enhancements, and changes to Citi policies, business processes and procedures.
Spotlight on Ethics

Citi shares with employees the results of ethics investigations, including a summary of corrective actions, through
a quarterly communication called the Spotlight on Ethics. This communication reinforces for employees that their
concerns are investigated and highlights commonplace areas in which ethical lapses can occur. In 2021, the Spotlight
on Ethics focused on select risk areas such as protecting information from inappropriate uses, the prohibition on using
unapproved communication methods to conduct Citi business, preventing retaliation or the suppression of concerns, and
the requirement to cooperate with appropriately authorized internal or external investigations.

Risk Management

We employ robust policies and

practices to thwart corruption,

address potential environmental

and social risks in our portfolio,

and safeguard data and customer

privacy. These rigorous practices

enable us to grow a successful,

respected business that delivers

the best possible results for

our clients, customers and

communities.

Managing Corruption

and Tax-Related Risks

Anti-Corruption Activities

Citi’s Financial Crimes Unit includes the

Global Financial Crimes Investigations

and Intelligence (GFCII), Anti-Bribery

and Corruption, Anti-Money Laundering

(AML) and Sanctions teams. Our Chief

Compliance Officer, who reports directly to

our CEO, provides regular reports on the

performance of our compliance program,

with regard to these areas, to our Board

of Directors or a committee of the Board,

as appropriate. Through our Financial

Crimes unit, Citi works to prevent, identify

and counteract the many and varied

corruption-related risks that confront the

financial sector.

For example, since its inception in 2018,

Citi has been an active member of United

for Wildlife’s Financial Taskforce, a collab-

oration between financial institutions and

nongovernmental organizations to fight

illegal wildlife trafficking. In 2021, Citi

worked with United for Wildlife, TRAFFIC

and two telecommunications companies

to create an illegal wildlife trade country

threat profile outlining critical risk scenarios

and indicators for countries in sub-Saharan

Africa, beginning with Kenya as a pilot.

In addition, during 2021, Citi’s GFCII
and Anti-Bribery and Corruption teams
participated in a working group led by the
Organisation for Economic Cooperation
and Development (OECD) to develop a
credible certification framework for eval-
uating infrastructure projects under the
auspices of the OECD’s Blue Dot Network.
Once implemented, this framework will
set a standard to develop market-driven,
transparent, financially sustainable
development projects. The working
group is made up of leaders and experts
from the private sector, civil society and
academia and is focused on the following
core themes: investment efficiency and
outcomes, environmental and social
considerations, and transparency and
integrity. Citi participants are shaping the
framework by sharing their expertise in
standards, guidelines and practices related
to AML and anti-bribery and corruption,
including third-party and advisor/inter-
mediary risk management, procurement
lobbying, controls, risk assessments,
metrics, Financial Action Task Force guid-
ance and customer due diligence.
In 2021, Citi also contributed to a multi-
session workshop sponsored by the
Terrorism, Transnational Crime and
Corruption Center, in conjunction with
the Association of Certified Anti-Money
Laundering Specialists. Participants
included several financial institutions
and leading nonprofit organizations with
expertise in environmental crimes, such
as TRAFFIC and key U.S. government
development agencies (e.g., USAID). The
workshops were designed to address key
aspects of global environmental crime
and corruption. GFCII provided several
presentations and led discussions on the
capability of financial institutions and
the importance of information-sharing
regarding typologies and red flags, to
address crimes related to environmental,
social and governance (ESG) issues.
As an outcome of the roundtable
discussions, TRAFFIC worked with GFCII
to provide specialized training to Citi
employees in our Europe, Middle East and
Africa region. This included a series of
webinars co-hosted by Citi, TRAFFIC and
the Environmental Investigation Agency,
a nongovernmental organization that
investigates and campaigns against envi-
ronmental crime and abuse. The training
series focused on how to identify red flags
in client onboarding and transactional
activity to disrupt the flow of income
generated by environmental crime.

Programs and Training to Combat Financial Crimes

Anti-Bribery Program

Citi has policies, procedures and internal controls to comply with anti-bribery laws, and we conduct an annual bribery risk assessment of all global

business lines. We provide our staff with anti-bribery training annually and supplement it with targeted training and communications as needed. For

more information, see the Citi Anti-Bribery Program Statement, which is updated at least annually.

Anti-Money Laundering Program

Citi’s Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Program protects our clients, our franchise and the global financial system from the risks of money laundering

and terrorist financing. The program includes more than 5,600 employees globally, including 225 designated AML Country Officers covering every

Citi business, function and geographic area. These specialists partner with various functions, including Compliance, Audit, Technology and our insti-

tutional and consumer businesses, to provide effective enterprise AML risk assessment and to meet our AML-related requirements at both the global

and the local levels. For more information, visit our AML Program website.

Global Financial Crimes Investigations and Intelligence

Global Financial Crimes Investigations and Intelligence (GFCII) is uniquely positioned within our Compliance function to tackle financial crime and

provide a globally consistent approach to the prevention and detection of risk. GFCII leverages its many trusted partnerships with law enforcement,

nonprofits and internal stakeholders to obtain actionable intelligence, primarily through participation in public/private forums, allowing for proactive

identification of illicit activity and effective mitigation of risk. This connectivity results in the execution of a data-driven global strategy addressing

emerging risk trends and typologies across business lines and geographies.

Sanctions Program

Citi is obligated to comply with applicable sanctions, laws and regulations in the countries where we operate and maintains a robust, risk-based

Independent Compliance Risk Management Sanctions Program that applies globally. As a financial institution organized in the United States, Citi and

our subsidiaries globally comply with applicable U.S. sanctions requirements, among other requirements. Our Sanctions Program includes policies

and procedures, risk category statement and tolerance thresholds, enterprise-wide screening, annual risk assessments and audits of sanctions

control processes, employee training and a diverse team of Compliance professionals stationed around the world.

For more information on our Financial Crimes programs, please see Citi’s Code of Conduct.

Taxation Policies

and Standards

Citi does business in more than 160

countries and jurisdictions, and maintains

strong review and escalation processes

that enable us to adhere to high standards

of compliance with applicable tax laws. We

are a current income taxpayer, both within

and outside the United States. Our tax

profile is consistent with the locations of

our business operations.

We emphasize strong internal controls and

transparency with global tax authorities

and share information relevant to our tax

profile. We supplement this transparency

with additional country-by-country report-

ing, which is required under the OECD’s

action plan to address base erosion and

profit shifting. Our tax policy is overseen
by our Chief Tax Officer, who reports to
the Chief Financial Officer. Tax policies and
related matters are reviewed by the Audit
Committee of the Board of Directors.
Citi maintains a strong system of controls
to facilitate reporting and withholding
requirements. We have systems and
processes to comply with the Foreign
Account Tax Compliance Act, and we are
in compliance with the Common Reporting
Standard in all applicable countries where
local implementing guidance has been
issued. Similarly, we have a firm-wide policy
applicable to customer transactions under
which Citi will only engage in transactions
where there is a high degree of certainty
that any tax aspects will be accepted by the
respective taxing authorities.
For more information on how taxation
impacts Citi, see page 128 of our
2021 Form 10-K.
Public Policy

Being a responsible corporate citizen
includes engagement in the political
process as a part of our strong ESG prac-
tice. The potential impact of public policy
on our business, employees, communities
and customers is an important reason
why Citi works to advance and protect the
global business interests of our company
directly and indirectly through engage-
ment with trade associations, governments
and elected officials around the world. Citi
advocates for public policies that support
the interests of our company, clients and
employees, such as trade, cybersecurity,
data localization, tax and financial reform.
Guided by Citi’s Political Engagement
Statement, company political activities are
performed in compliance with applicable
laws and regulations.
Under U.S. Federal Election Commission
rules, Citi’s Political Action Committee (Citi
PAC) pools the voluntary contributions of
eligible employees to support U.S. political
candidates and campaigns that support
the financial industry and complementary
pro-business policies. In 2021, we reviewed
and strengthened our principles for deter-
mining future support by Citi PAC. The
updated criteria include:
- Support of business issues important
to Citi
- Position on a committee with jurisdic-
tion over policy issues important to Citi,
or elected leadership position
- Representation of a state or district
where Citi has a significant employee
presence
- Character and integrity, and demon-
strated commitment to bipartisanship,
governing and protecting democratic
institutions

Safeguarding Data

and Protecting

Customer Information

As digital solutions expand and become

more integrated into our daily lives, we

see increasing concerns related to privacy

and security breaches. Data security and

customer privacy are top priorities for Citi

and for our stakeholders. The COVID-19

pandemic has led to an even greater

reliance on digital technologies, which

makes safeguarding data and customer

information even more vital.

Cybersecurity

Citi’s Chief Information Security Office

(CISO) organization ensures that an appro-

priate level of cybersecurity governance,

capabilities and controls are in place to

protect Citi’s and our clients’ information

assets, with end-to-end accountability

across the firm. Our approach rests on

ensuring we have the right architecture,

technology, policies, processes and talent

in place to prevent, detect, respond to and

recover from cyber threats quickly.

Our Cybersecurity Program is overseen by

Citi’s Board of Directors and is regularly

reviewed by regulators, as well as by inter-

nal and external auditors. The program

is managed by the Chief Enterprise

Operations & Technology Officer and

the Chief Information Security Officer

on a global enterprise basis; the Chief

Executives of each business sector and

region are responsible for implementation

and compliance with program require-

ments. Annually, we provide our employees

with training on how to properly handle

and maintain the security and privacy of

Citi’s and our clients’ information.

During 2021, Citi’s cybersecurity team
organized a series of preparedness
exercises for employees, including
cybersecurity scenarios for global
functions and lines of business across
both our Institutional Clients Group and
Personal Banking & Wealth Management
divisions. Due to the continued impact
of COVID-19, these events were again
conducted remotely. During the year,
we saw continued growth in demand
from senior executives for cybersecurity
exercises. The Citi cybersecurity team
conducted a series of linked exercises for
our various regions, culminating with an
exercise for our CEO and Global Operating
team. Citi’s Cybersecurity Fusion Center
participated in these global cybersecurity
exercises and conducted additional drills
dedicated to its operations.
To safeguard information, we invest in
and develop advanced security solutions
that allow us to better support our
digital strategy. For instance, we are
implementing a multifaceted approach to
move toward password-less capabilities,
including biometric options such as voice
recognition or fingerprints. These solutions
create a frictionless and more secure
experience for both internal and external
users. In addition, Citi has invested in
next-generation security components
that support digital and mobile growth,
by enabling enhanced security features
for our mobile applications. Further
investments in advanced technology have
provided Citi with improved cyber incident
monitoring, detection and response
capabilities, strengthening the bank’s
cybersecurity posture.
Citi conducts regular cybersecurity risk
assessments and has internal controls to
defend against cybersecurity breaches.
We maintain technology and cybersecurity
policies based on established industry
standards and employ robust technol-
ogies to protect our data and systems,
supported by a strong team with deep
expertise from industry and government.
Our CISO team safeguards information
from data breaches and misuse by
maintaining secure networks to protect

CITI 2021 ESG REPORT 113

our systems and databases, and we

continuously improve our capabilities to

meet the challenge of an evolving threat

environment.

In the event of a potential breach, we have

a robust process to ensure appropriate

reporting and notification, which includes:

- Reviewing the breach to determine

whether it meets any regulatory or
legal reporting requirements in the
country(ies) where the breach occurred
or in the country(ies) impacted by the
breach. If deemed necessary, a legal
assessment is conducted.
- Notifying the impacted customers as

required by the laws or regulations
of the impacted country(ies) and as
directed in the legal assessment, if it
results in a requirement to perform
customer notifications.
We understand that simply defending

ourselves is not enough. We must also

influence the broader cybersecurity

landscape within which Citi operates. As

such, we collaborate with our clients, peer

financial institutions, governments, law

enforcement and intelligence agencies

on a global scale to share best practices,

exchange tactical information about

specific cybersecurity threats, conduct

joint cyber resilience exercises and work to

drive adoption of industry-wide standards

and approaches that will best enable the

collective defense of the financial services

sector against cybersecurity challenges.

Our security teams receive and share

threat data with our partners in near

real time, leveraging that information to

strengthen our internal controls and prac-

tices and to protect Citi from attacks being

perpetrated against other firms. Citi takes
a leadership role in fostering a culture of
sharing amongst our competitors on secu-
rity issues, putting competitive instincts
aside for the sake of strong information
security practices.
Privacy

The fair, ethical and lawful collection, use
and processing of customers’ personal
information is essential to build trust,
provide best-in-class services and achieve
our corporate objectives. To help meet
this goal, Citi has established a dedicated
Chief Privacy Office team, led by a global
Chief Privacy Officer. The Chief Privacy
Office, part of our Independent Compliance
Risk Management team, manages the
Citi Global Privacy Program, which is
overseen by Citi’s Privacy Advisory Body.
The program provides a framework for
managing privacy and confidentiality risks
for the company. Citi has also established
the Global Chief Privacy Counsel under the
General Counsel’s Office. The Global Chief
Privacy Counsel provides guidance and
strategic direction regarding privacy and
data protection laws to the Chief Privacy
Office and to businesses and functions
across the enterprise.
Citi’s Privacy and Bank Customer
Confidentiality Policy articulates principles
relating to the collection and processing
of personal information, requiring, in part,
that personal information only be collected
and used as necessary for the perfor-
mance of the services offered and for the
purposes disclosed in a privacy notice. Citi
is transparent in our collection and use
practices and offers customers choices
about how their personal information may
be collected or otherwise used (as required
by law), including opting out of marketing
or other communications or reviewing and
correcting information. Citi employees are
required to take privacy and information
compliance training that covers these
privacy concepts.
Protecting Digital Identity

For financial institutions such as Citi,
verifying our customers’ identity is funda-
mental to safeguarding their financial
assets and protecting their privacy. Our
aim is to deliver solutions that provide
seamless, intuitive interactions with digital
tools that won’t compromise personal
data. To provide ongoing training for
our employees, we have created digital
identity learning packs that help build
awareness of — and skills related to — new
digital identity technologies. In addition,
we engage with clients, partners and
industry experts to discuss the trends,
challenges and opportunities related to
digital identity and to explore cutting-edge
technologies that have the potential to
meet our customers’ needs.
We also provide our customers with
timely resources and information related
to safety and security. Our U.S. online
Security Center enables customers to
learn about what Citi does to protect them
and what they can do to protect them-
selves against identify theft and other
security risks.

If a transaction impacts any of the following Areas of
High Caution, ESRM will conduct enhanced due diligence
The ESRM team reviews transactions subject to policy

and benchmarks against relevant industry standards/

best practice, identifying opportunities for improvement

and engagement.

Environmental

and Social Risk

Management

Our Environmental and Social Risk

Management (ESRM) Policy helps us

identify potential risks within the billions of

dollars in global transactions we facilitate

worldwide. This policy also sets a frame-

work for us to evaluate how our clients are

managing those risks.

Our ESRM Policy

Our ESRM Policy, which is summarized

publicly in our Environmental and Social

Policy Framework, helps us finance

projects and activities responsibly by

engaging our clients on environmental
and social risks and best practices. We
established the Policy in 2003, and
we continue to evolve our approach in
response to emerging risks and new
product development. In 2021, we
updated our ESRM Policy by adding a
policy prohibition against financing for
companies constructing or operating
private prisons as a primary business.
Although this has not been an issue for
our company in the past, we decided to
formalize this commitment through an
official policy update.
Our comprehensive ESRM Policy covers
a broad scope of financial products and
client sectors and guides how we assess
client impacts on air quality, water
quality, climate change, biodiversity, local
communities, labor, human rights and
other environmental and social issues.
Our internal policies and procedures
reference international industry stan-
dards, such as the International Finance
Corporation’s Environmental and Social
Performance Standards and the World
Bank Group’s Environmental, Health, and
Safety Guidelines. Where relevant, we
also require clients to adhere to sector
and commodity-specific guidelines and
certifications such as the Roundtable
on Sustainable Palm Oil and the Forest
Stewardship Council.
Citi’s ESRM Policy at a Glance

ESRM Policy objective: Effectively assess and manage the

environmental and social risks associated with financing

client activities in sectors with sensitive environmental

and social impacts. A transaction or client relationship may

trigger the ESRM Policy for three reasons:

Citi’s ESRM Sector Approaches apply sector-specific
review requirements for certain clients in sensitive sectors
Citi’s ESRM Policy also includes a number of prohibitions
for highest concern environmental and social risks. Refer

review under our ESRM Policy. We also

provide ESRM training to key risk and

banking personnel globally, enabling

them to spot potential risks. In addition,

our ESRM Champions, located around

the world, use their regional expertise

and additional ESRM training to serve as

bridges between our local banking teams

and our global ESRM team. This network

approach enhances the global coverage

capacity of our centralized specialist

team. The ESRM team shares information

and best practices with ESRM Champions

to support and strengthen the entire

network.

When the viability of a deal is first

explored, our ESRM team works with Citi

bankers to evaluate the magnitude of the

potential environmental and social impacts

associated with the transaction and to

determine what action, if any, is needed to

comply with our ESRM Policy prior to final

approval of the transaction. If Citi receives

a mandate to move forward with a trans-

action that involves such risks, the ESRM

team continues to work with the banking

team to conduct due diligence commensu-

rate with the risks faced.

Higher-risk, project-related transactions

may receive in-depth reviews by indepen-

dent environmental and social consultants

to benchmark against international

standards. If gaps are found between a

client’s environmental and social plans,

policies or practices and international

standards, we require the development of

an Environmental and Social Action Plan

(ESAP) to fill the gaps. As a condition of

financing, we require the client to imple-

ment the ESAP by specifying covenants

in the loan agreement, and we monitor

its progress over time. In some cases,

we decline to participate in a transaction

because we do not believe we can
adequately address the environmental and
social risks through mitigation measures
or because the risks are too high.
Applying our ESRM Policy helps us to
identify risks beyond traditional credit
risks, guides how we evaluate transactions
related to companies or projects in high-
risk sectors and presents opportunities
for us to advise clients on solutions to
thematic risks.
Over the last few years, we have seen a
rapid increase in the volume and variety
of transactions flagged for ESRM review.
This is due to increased interest from
regulators on ESRM-related issues and the
growth in ESG-related financial products,
as well as greater engagement across
the firm as employees receive additional
training and become more aware of the
potential environmental and social risks in
the transactions they are managing. For
example, the responsibility and activities
of our ESRM team have expanded in recent
years to account for increasing attention
and concern related to climate risk. For
information about our approach and
management activities in this area, see the
Climate Risk and Net Zero section.
The ESRM section of our Environmental
and Social Policy Framework outlines the
scope of our ESRM Policy, including the
types of transactions that trigger a review,
and provides additional detail about our
risk-screening practices and categories,
independent reviews and action plans. The
Framework also includes an overview of
our Areas of High Caution, sector-specific
approaches and policy prohibitions.
Ongoing engagement with our clients is
an important part of our ESRM process.
When we first established our ESRM policy,
our engagements were tied to specific,
project-related financial transactions and
their associated environmental and social
risks and mitigation efforts. However, as
we have developed Sector Approaches
and Areas of High Caution over the years,
we have added corporate-level reviews
and client engagements in a number of
Contents ESG at Citi Sustainable Finance Sustainable Progress Equitable & Resilient Communities Talent & DEI Risk Management & Responsible Business Appendices

CITI 2021 ESG REPORT 116

sectors. These sector-specific risk review

processes encourage dialogue between

Citi and our clients about the material envi-

ronmental and social risks associated with

their operations, enabling us to develop a

better understanding of prevailing indus-

try practices and our clients’ performance

and to guide our clients toward more

sustainable practices.

Monitoring the Changing

Risk Landscape

The ESRM team uses a number of methods

to proactively scan the changing risk

landscape for new, emerging risks, as well

as risks with increased prominence and

prevalence. Through internal research,

engagement with our regional ESRM

Champions, collaboration with others in

our industry, and the use of third-party

environmental and social data, we monitor

relevant developments in high-risk

industries and stakeholder concerns to
flag emerging issues.
Proactive monitoring enables us to identify
issues and the interrelated impacts of
various sectors, so we can be responsive
to evolving risks, raise awareness within
Citi about emerging issues and identify
clients that may be impacted for further
engagement. We are beginning to
incorporate new tools to scan for emerging
environmental and social risks. The team
has reviewed a range of technologies
for use in our due diligence approach,
such as environmental DNA gathering to
conduct biodiversity baseline studies and
benchmark improvements in biodiversity
values over time. This technique enables
the analysis of DNA in water or soil
samples to identify the fauna living in a
given project area without the need to
visually verify their presence.
Another way we monitor risk is by conduct-
ing sector-specific reviews to identify and
mitigate emerging risks in our existing
portfolio. These evaluations are based on
information published or provided by the
client as well as information from special-
ized ESG rating agencies and topic-specific
databases. This process enables us to
better understand how our clients manage
environmental and social issues and
provides valuable insight into the level of
related risk across our portfolio. In 2021,
we conducted reviews of our mining, oil
and gas, and power portfolios as well as a
portfolio review of our clients in Malaysia
related to human rights.
PROTECTING BIODIVERSITY AND ADDRESSING RESETTLEMENT CONCERNS IN PANAMA CITY

In 2021, Citi, in coordination with other financial institutions, closed a $2 billion transaction to finance Metro Line 3,
an expansion of Panama City’s metro system. Citi worked with Consorcio HPH, a consortium of Korean companies
responsible for the construction of Metro Line 3. Because this is a project-related corporate loan for more than
$50 million, due diligence processes required an independent review before the close of the transaction. Consorcio HPH
and the lenders engaged environmental and social consultant, ERM, to evaluate the project’s environmental and social
impacts and benchmark management plans against international standards. This due diligence revealed two primary
risks related to the project: potential biodiversity impacts and physical/economic displacement of individuals and
businesses along the path of the new metro line.
To address biodiversity concerns and align the project with IFC Performance Standard 6 for biodiversity, ERM performed
a Critical Habitat Assessment to study potential impacts on migratory and/or congregatory species within the project’s
area of influence. ERM identified an Important Bird Area, including habitat for species such as the broad-winged hawk,
Swainson’s hawk and turkey vulture. The assessment revealed that a small area of Critical Habitat (0.54 hectare) would
be directly impacted by the project. In order to ensure a net gain of critical habitat and no net-loss of natural habitat,
Consorcio HPH will implement reforestation and biodiversity monitoring programs to measure results.
After a review of impacts related to resettlement and livelihood displacement, it was determined that the project’s need
for resettlement would be minimal. Nonetheless, Consorcio HPH is working with Metro de Panama S.A. (MPSA) to ensure
that proper protocols are followed when engaging with residents about the need for resettlement, attaining willing seller
consent, providing adequate compensation and developing livelihood restoration plans for those who may be impacted.
MPSA is also working with a social consultant to enhance its local resettlement process to align with international
best practice, including the IFC Performance Standard 5 for resettlement. As an additional precaution, the project’s
construction schedule is tied to review by ERM and the lenders to ensure that resettlement risks are fully assessed and
benchmarked before construction begins in areas where resettlement or displacement may occur.

Client Engagement

Our ESRM team is collaborating with our

Sustainability and Corporate Transitions

team to engage with clients working to

transition toward more sustainable strat-

egies and business models. This provides

opportunities for in-depth discussions of

specific sustainability topics, identifies ways

of proactively mitigating environmental and

social risks, and supports our clients in their

efforts to align with international standards

and benchmarks. For example, during an

engagement with mining clients in 2021, our

ESRM team provided insight and analysis

related to the sustainable finance market

and the challenges and opportunities for

mining companies related to environmental

and social risk. The breadth and depth of our

ESRM team’s knowledge in these areas is a

valuable tool to help us assess new trans-

actions and to guide and advise our clients

as we work toward achieving our net zero

commitment. For more information about

the work Citi is doing to help clients transi-

tion to a low-carbon future, see the Financing

the Low-Carbon Transition section.

Industry Collaboration

We participate in many environmentally
and socially focused initiatives and orga-
nizations, such as the Equator Principles
Association and the Roundtable on
Sustainable Palm Oil.
Citi is also a member of the Taskforce
on Nature-related Financial Disclosures
(TNFD) Forum. We participated in an
informal working group prior to the official
launch of the Taskforce to develop the
TNFD’s workplan for creating a comple-
mentary framework to the Task Force on
Climate-related Financial Disclosures, but
with a focus on reporting nature-related
risks rather than climate-related risks.
Climate and biodiversity are intercon-
nected, and there are increasing concerns
that climate change, along with other
human activity, has stressed natural
systems and contributed to ongoing
extinction events.^1 Through our collabora-
tion with TNFD, we are able to contribute
to important nature-related reporting
standards and continue to refine our
understanding of the complex interaction
of climate and biodiversity and our
connection with those impacts through our
financial relationships with our clients.
ESRM Training

Each year, we train key risk and banking
personnel on our ESRM Policy to help them
identify triggers for engagement with
our ESRM specialist team. Topics include
environmental and social risks relevant
to certain regions and sectors, implemen-
tation of the Equator Principles and Citi’s
Sector Approaches, as well as specific
topics such as human rights, biodiversity
and emerging climate risk analysis. Due to
increased focus from key stakeholders in
ESG issues, more bankers across our firm
are receiving ESRM training, which enables
them to spot potential risks and engage
with our ESRM team more effectively. In
total, 950 Citi employees underwent ESRM
training during 2021, significantly more than
in 2020. All training in 2021 was conducted
on live webinars for employees globally.

Serving Our Customers

and Clients Responsibly

We have policies and systems

in place to help ensure that we

always treat customers responsi-

bly and fairly, such as our Code of

Conduct and the internal checks

and balances we employ when

creating new products.

Responsible Marketing

We are committed to offering clients an

array of products and services based on

their needs, wants and preferences, while

adhering to our internal policies and proce-

dures as well as applicable laws and regula-

tions. We work diligently to clearly disclose

all features and terms and conditions,

including applicable fees and charges, for

the products and services offered, so that

clients can select and use the products or

services best suited to them.

Our chosen name initiative for U.S.

Branded credit card members offers

transgender and nonbinary customers the

ability to use their chosen first name on

their eligible card and within our servicing

channels. As of early 2022, more than

22,000 customers had updated their first

name on their physical credit cards, and

citi.com/updatemyname had received

more than 210,000 visits. Most impor-

tantly, we’ve received notes like this from

customers: “I wish that there was some-

thing like this when I began my transition.

This will remove one of the many worries

that we have all had when we were intro-

ducing our true selves to the world.”

To celebrate the launch of the chosen

name initiative, we created an advertising

campaign featuring people from across

the gender diversity spectrum, both in

front of and behind the camera. This initia-
tive has been a significant step forward in
helping this community feel recognized,
accepted and empowered. In recognition
of its impact, the initiative was honored
as one of Fast Company’s 2021 World
Changing Ideas.
Another example of how we continue to
amplify our purpose-driven initiatives is
through Citi’s global, mission-led part-
nership with the International Paralympic
Committee, which focuses on positively
changing societal perceptions of people
with disabilities. Over the past several
years of our partnership, Citi sponsored 23
National Paralympic Committees and more
than 50 Para athletes across the globe in
their quest to compete at the highest level.
In Summer 2021, we celebrated our Team
Citi Para athletes and showed the world
that “It’s Okay to Stare” at the talents and
accomplishments of the disability commu-
nity through the #StareAtGreatness
campaign. Our advertising and social
media campaign successfully raised
awareness of the incredible achievements
of these athletes and others within the
disability community, earning recognition
as a finalist in two categories at the 2022
Halo Awards. In early 2022, Citi extended
the #StareAtGreatness campaign with 15
sponsored Team Citi Winter Para athletes
to continue driving conversations around
the world.
As part of Citi’s Action for Racial Equity
goals, we are collaborating with our
agency partners to increase the percent-
age of people of color working on Citi
accounts and to increase representation
of people of color in our marketing. By
the end of 2023, we aspire to achieve the
following:
Aim to increase representation in the
agencies we work with
- People of color making up at least 25%
of the agency teams working on Citi
accounts
- People of color comprising at least
8% of senior agency leadership, in line
with Citi’s own commitment

DESIGNING FOR ACCESSIBILITY

As we strive to put all customers at the center of what we do, we recognize
the importance of providing products and services that meet accessibility
needs and preferences. The videos our U.S. Branded Cards business creates
to heighten customer comprehension of key topics are designed to be fully
accessible. This includes real-time descriptive transcripts, embedded closed
captions and content readability.
In addition, we offer Braille and talking ATMs, large print and Braille
statements and raised-line checks for the visually impaired. We also offer
TTY or Text Telephone for the hard of hearing. Many of our services are
provided in multiple languages to support the diverse populations we serve,
and our products are tailored to meet the needs of the individuals in the
countries where we do business.

CITI 2021 ESG REPORT 121

Aim to increase representation in our

marketing

- People of color making up at least

25% of casting for Citi marketing
- Aim for at least 25% of brand stories

highlighting minority-owned businesses
and organizations annually
To cultivate greater diversity and inclusiv-

ity in our marketing and communications,

we collaborated with Getty Images to

develop Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DE&I)

Imagery Toolkits. Each toolkit harnesses

Getty Images’ proprietary data (Visual

GPS) and Kantar’s Global MONITOR

research to provide marketers, communi-

cators and creatives with useful insights to

create authentic and multifaceted depic-

tions of people in our global marketing

and communications. We began rolling

out these toolkits in 2021, including in the
United States, and will launch in additional
markets in 2022. The toolkits feature coun-
try-specific data and consumer insights to
capture cultural and regional nuances, and
custom training is provided to Citi employ-
ees for each market. The toolkits will be
available to the public on the Getty Images
DE&I Imagery Toolkit hub.
These initiatives are just some examples
of our firm-wide commitment to promote
activities that are in the best interests of
our clients. More broadly, new products are
approved by cross-functional committees
that include senior executives from Risk,
Legal, our Independent Compliance Risk
Management team and other relevant units,
supported by specialists from Consumer
Fairness, as needed. Citi also does peri-
odic testing or monitoring of marketing
materials and disclosures. In addition,
Personal Banking & Wealth Management
has a global approach for handling
customer complaints and concerns in a
timely and effective manner, in line with our
commitment to provide financial services
responsibly and treat customers fairly.
Helping Customers Give Back

We offer our U.S. cardholders an opportunity to make a difference
by turning their ThankYou® Points into charitable gifts to nonprofits.
In 2021, we joined the (RED)EEM initiative which enables eligible
cardmembers to make donations with PayPal’s Pay with Rewards
feature and supports organizations working to ensure equitable
access to COVID-19 testing, treatment and vaccines in the
world’s poorest countries. We also expanded the list of eligible
organizations to include Susan G. Komen. The list also includes
American Red Cross, No Kid Hungry, UNICEF USA and others.
Since 2014, Citi’s support has also helped No Kid Hungry provide up
to 290 million meals for the millions of kids facing hunger across
America. In 2021, Citi encouraged clients to enroll their Citi credit
cards in the Dine and Do Good campaign. For every $5 or more
spent dining out, Citi donated $1 to No Kid Hungry until the $1 million
donation goal was met. Additionally, on Giving Tuesday, Citi engaged
colleagues and general consumers to help raise enough to provide
more than 10 million meals in a single day, with Citi’s support alone
driving 40% of dollars raised.
No Kid Hungry is the only national campaign solely
dedicated to ending childhood hunger.

Eliminating Overdraft Fees for Our Customers’ Financial Wellness

Citi recently announced plans to eliminate overdraft fees, returned item fees and overdraft protection transfer fees for U.S.
Retail Banking consumers by Summer 2022. This makes Citi the only top-five U.S. bank (based on assets*) to completely eliminate
these fees, and it demonstrates our commitment to expanding access to inclusive banking products and services that can help
advance economic progress, especially for underbanked and unbanked populations.
For 20 years, we have put measures in place to minimize overdraft fees for our consumers in order to put their financial wellness
first. In addition to the upcoming changes, Citi will also continue to offer a robust suite of overdraft protection transfer services
for our consumers including:
Overdraft Protection Transfer Services: Citi offers two services that help consumers avoid checking account overdrafts and
retutrned items — Safety Check and Checking Plus
® (variable rate) line of credit
. The fees associated with these services will
also be eliminated.
Access Account Package: Citi’s industry-leading, checkless account package with low or avoidable monthly charges provides
consumers with a simple, transparent way to manage their finances and systemically limits point-of-sale, ATM and ACH
transactions that could cause negative balances.
Common Sense Protection Measures: Citi will not authorize ATM or point-of-sale debit transactions in cases when funds are not available.
Low Balance Alerts: Consumers can enroll in Low Balance Alerts via their account online or through the Citi Mobile® App.
The elimination of overdraft fees complements many of our firm-wide Action for Racial Equity efforts in the United States that
aim to expand banking and credit for communities of color.

CITI’S TREATING CUSTOMERS FAIRLY
PRINCIPLES
We aim to deliver products and services that provide
value, clarity and dependability, guided by the Treating
Customers Fairly principles that define the standards
for our products and services. These principles
include:
Works as described: Consumers can predict how
products and services will work.
Appropriate: Consumers can rely on Citi to offer
appropriate products and services that meet their
needs.
Value: Consumers receive value that is reasonably
related to the cost of the products and services.
Ease of understanding: Consumers understand the
terms and conditions of the products and services
(particularly limitations and exclusions). In November 2021, we opened a new branch and Client Center at
our global headquarters in New York City.

Treating Customers

Fairly

Through Citi’s commitment to our Treating

Customers Fairly principles and our Global

Consumer Fairness Policy, we strive to

earn and maintain the public’s trust by

adhering to high ethical standards in

conducting our business.

The Global Consumer Fairness Policy

provides a framework for reviewing

consumer fairness concerns and a

sustainable model for managing emerging

risks. The policy covers all aspects of the

consumer product and services life cycle,

including new product development,

marketing, sales (including variable

incentive compensation), underwriting

and onboarding, as well as all other

stages. There are established, formalized

escalation processes to Citi’s governance

committees and Board of Directors

that facilitate consistent, timely and
appropriate identification, analysis and
escalation of potential consumer fairness
and reputational and franchise risk issues.
In relation to designing variable incentive
plans, we consider a number of factors,
including whether plans align with our
Treating Customers Fairly principles. For
example, we leverage client satisfaction
metrics, where available, along with other
product-based metrics, to incentivize
achieving business results that adhere to
internal policies and our Code of Conduct.
We routinely evaluate incentive plans,
training content, controls, monitoring
results and oversight activities to maintain
a sales force that delivers on Citi’s
commitment to serving our customers with
fairness, value, clarity and dependability.
As part of the program, Personal Banking
& Wealth Management and Institutional
Clients Group employees complete annual
Treating Customers Fairly training to
ensure they understand how to identify
issues of fairness and how fairness influ-
ences real-world results. The 2021 course
was launched to more than 95,000 Citi
employees globally.
We also have measures in place to monitor
sales practices, including auditing and
metrics that assess client risk profiles.
When appropriate, we proactively contact
delinquent clients, using their credit risk
profile and previous payment perfor-
mance to determine how quickly and
how often to contact them. We ensure
that contact strategies are vetted for
privacy and fairness considerations before
implementation.
The Global Financial Access Policy is a key
component of our commitment to fair and
equitable access to products and services.
This policy establishes the guiding
principles and minimum standards for fair,
equitable and nondiscriminatory access to
credit. Further, it prohibits discrimination
against actual or prospective clients on
the basis of race, ethnicity, sex (which
encompasses gender as well as sexual
orientation, gender identity and gender
expression), religion, national origin,
disability or other prohibited factors.
This commitment is backed by training,
processes, controls and oversight to
prevent discrimination. In addition, we
continually work to understand evolving
discrimination risks and update our
approach to preventing such risks in our
business strategies, as well as in the design
and delivery of our products and services.
True to our commitment to responsible
finance, we hold an annual Fair and
Inclusive Banking offsite with senior
management from across the company, to
deepen their understanding of fair lending,
consumer fairness and accessibility.

Human Rights

Citi’s rigorous human rights

policies, standards and due

diligence practices guide our

business and lending decisions.

We consistently engage with our

employees, suppliers, peers and

industry experts, as well as civil

society organizations focused on

our clients and the projects we

finance, to advance the protection

of human rights.

Our Commitment

to Respect Human

Rights

We are committed to respecting human

rights wherever we do business. We

engage human rights experts, clients and

peers to support our efforts to respect

human rights in line with the UN Guiding

Principles on Business and Human Rights

— a global framework for preventing and

addressing the risk of adverse impacts on

human rights linked to business activity.

The UN Guiding Principles draw upon

existing international human rights instru-

ments whose principles Citi has endorsed,

such as those in the UN Universal

Declaration of Human Rights and the

International Labour Organization’s (ILO)

Core Conventions. To illustrate our imple-

mentation of the UN Guiding Principles, we

have mapped how this ESG Report aligns

with the UN Guiding Principles Reporting

Framework (see index).

Citi regularly updates our policies and

practices to strengthen our human rights

due diligence. During the development

and subsequent updates of our Statement

on Human Rights, which we first adopted

in 2007, we engaged internal and external

stakeholders to help assess our actual
and potential human rights impacts and
to identify the most salient human rights
risks faced by our employees, workers
connected to our supply chain and
individuals who might be affected by our
clients’ operations.
Citi’s Environmental and Social Risk
Management (ESRM) Policy, summarized
in our Environmental and Social Policy
Framework, guides our approach to assess-
ing environmental and social risks related to
financing our clients’ business activities. For
more information about our ESRM Policy
and our related due diligence processes,
see the Environmental and Social Risk
Management section of this report.
We regularly review and update our ESRM
Policy to ensure that it reflects our most
recent understanding of potential envi-
ronmental and social risks. For example,
during 2021, we updated the Policy to
include a formal prohibition against
financing for companies whose primary
business is constructing or operating
private prisons. Although we do not have
such clients directly connected to private
prisons, we decided to formalize this policy
prohibition for the future in alignment with
our Action for Racial Equity commitments.
ELEVATING ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE CONCERNS FOR
ENHANCED DUE DILIGENCE
Over the last several years, there has been growing global acknowledgment
that climate change is a human rights issue. In 2021, the UN Human Rights
Council recognized the right to a healthy environment as a stand-alone
human right. Citi has also recognized for many years the right to a healthy
environment and the need to evaluate the potential environmental risks
to communities surrounding the industrial developments we finance. For
example, due diligence related to environmental justice concerns is critical
for identifying projects with significant impacts to local communities
from fossil-fuel-related activities, including extraction, refinement and
transportation or air and water pollution due to heavy industry.
Environmental justice is also important as we consider low-carbon projects
with positive environmental benefits that might have negative impacts
on local communities. For example, a dam construction project to create
renewable hydro-electric power could threaten human rights if it is sited
without consideration of the rights of Indigenous or other marginalized
peoples. While we want to champion projects that help combat climate
change, we need to keep our eyes open to other adverse impacts that may
occur, particularly in relation to already marginalized communities.
As of 2020, we formalized environmental justice as a specific risk within
the Areas of High Caution section of our ESRM Policy that triggers enhanced
due diligence.

to understand and mitigate the most

salient human rights risks related to our

business — those that pose the greatest

risk to people — including the activities of

our clients and other business partners.

The most severe potential risks posed to

people by our clients’ activities, partic-

ularly in the context of project-related

finance, are identified under our ESRM

Policy. Our work to address these risks

began in 2003 when we helped to found

the Equator Principles (EP) framework to

enhance and standardize risk management

across the banking sector, established an

internal ESRM team, and began developing

our risk identification and mitigation

policies and procedures. While our formal

ESRM processes give us the most leverage

when we are directly financing a project,

we also screen for human rights risks and
opportunities to engage clients in other
types of corporate financing covered by
our ESRM Policy and in targeted ESRM
portfolio reviews of high risk sectors
or geographies. In addition, we work to
identify and address salient human rights
risks that could arise in other areas of
our value chain such as our supply chain,
our workforce and our consumer banking
activities. For a full list of our salient
human rights risks and the stakeholders
they may impact, see the table on the
following page.
Efforts to achieve racial equity and promote
diversity and inclusion relate directly to
the protection of human rights, as these
efforts seek to remedy disparities and
protect individuals from discrimination on
the basis of essential characteristics. We
have identified salient human rights risks
in this area, including discrimination in the
provision of financial services and threats
to diversity and inclusion. You can learn
about Citi’s Action for Racial Equity commit-
ments, established in 2020, and additional
inclusion initiatives related to our supply
chain, our workforce and the communities
we serve throughout this report.
For human rights concerns related to a
particular client, transaction or portfolio,
we escalate those issues to the relevant
internal Reputation Risk Committee.
In addition, in 2021, we established an
Asia Pacific Human Rights Task Force,
comprised of senior bankers and risk
managers. The aim of the task force is to
enable a more standardized approach to
addressing salient human rights risks that
arise in that region. For more information
about our governance of ESG issues,
including human rights, see the ESG
Governance at Citi section.

Salient Human Rights Risks: Stakeholder Impacts

This table illustrates which stakeholders could be impacted by the human rights risks we have identified as most salient

to our company. Rows shaded in gray indicate risks related to the Areas of High Caution defined in our ESRM Policy and

trigger additional due diligence for project transactions, general corporate purpose transactions and regular reviews of

client relationships. Additional context about our approach to mitigate these risks and related due diligence processes

can be found throughout this report, in our Statement on Human Rights and in our Environmental and Social Policy

Addressing Forced Labor in Malaysia

Migrant laborers have the potential to become the victims of forced labor practices, due largely to the significant debt they incur through the process

of recruitment, obtaining travel documentation and gaining entry into a foreign country. During 2021, this issue gained heightened attention due

to the increased focus of the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol on migrant working conditions, with the agency issuing a number of Withhold Release

Orders refusing entry of products into the U.S. market that were suspected of being made in whole or in part by forced labor. This included several

Malaysian companies involved in the manufacture of personal protective equipment and palm oil products.

When migrant workers arrive in Malaysia, they sometimes find that the salaries they earn are too low to cover the cost of repaying recruitment fees

and expenses. Compounding the problem, their employers often withhold employee identity documents. This can put migrant workers in a precarious

position as they are dependent on their job to repay their debts and, if they face challenging working conditions, they may be unable to look for other

employment given the inaccessibility of their work permits and identity documents.

Citi has a longstanding prohibition against providing financing to any company that uses forced labor practices as defined by the ILO’s 11 Forced

Labour Indicators. The Citi Malaysia team partnered with our global ESRM team to conduct a portfolio review in Malaysia to determine which Citi

clients may have higher risk for potential forced labor practices and whether those clients have policies and procedures in place to address that risk.

Out of hundreds of corporate and subsidiary client relationships reviewed, we identified 29 in higher-risk sectors with high migrant labor employee

populations that required enhanced ESRM due diligence to assess client practices against international labor practices. In situations where this

review uncovered high risks that were not adequately addressed through company policies and practices, or when credible accusations of forced

labor existed, we engaged those clients on improvements needed. When necessary, we required clients to bring in labor rights experts to audit and

suggest improvements for their policies and procedures, and we set up regular meetings to assess progress to close these gaps.

While this is an important step, we also acknowledge that due to the long history of precarious migrant labor working conditions in Malaysia, and in

other countries that rely on similar systems, it will take time and continued work to raise awareness to change ingrained practices. With this in mind,

Citi Malaysia and the ESRM team took an additional step to educate clients and raise awareness by working with a forced labor expert to develop a

webinar for our Malaysian clients. This webinar focused on international standards based on the ILO’s Forced Labour Indicators, risk identification

methodologies and best practices for preventing forced labor in corporate operations and supply chains, such as employer payment of recruitment

fees, reimbursement of debt, ethical recruitment procedures, employee access to identity documents, and proper pay, overtime management and

grievance mechanisms. More than 100 clients in Malaysia attended this webinar and it was very well received.

Learn more about this issue on the U.S. Customs and Border Protection and ILO websites.

CITI 2021 ESG REPORT 128

Respecting the

Human Rights of

Our Employees

We expect every Citi employee to adhere

to our Code of Conduct, which includes

a commitment to human rights, and to

participate in relevant training. Our Code

of Conduct prohibits unlawful discrimina-

tion, harassment and other behavior that

infringes on individual rights. As stated

in our Code of Conduct, Citi expects all

employees, as well as suppliers, clients and

community partners globally to respect

the principle of nondiscrimination.

Citi has identified workplace discrimination

and threats to diversity and inclusion

as salient human rights risks for our

company. As such, respect for diversity

and inclusion is a high priority wherever

we operate. It can become a particular

concern in countries where there is no

legal protection against discrimination

based on gender, gender identity, race,

ethnicity, age, religion, physical or mental

disability or medical condition, or sexual

orientation, in addition to a range of other

essential characteristics inherent to iden-

tity and personhood. Citi prohibits discrim-

ination and harassment of our employees

in all forms, regardless of whether or not

individual protections are legally mandated

in the countries and communities where

we operate. In fact, we know that even in

locations with anti-discrimination laws,

there is still a need for companies to

ensure that they are doing their part to

respect individual rights.

In 2021, we established a team in the

United States to identify and accelerate

hiring of diverse talent. We also strive to

increase the diversity of our workforce

through the use of diverse slates in our

hiring process and by setting aspirational

goals related to diverse representation

for Assistant Vice President to Managing

Director levels. Citi has also signed the
Human Rights Campaign’s Business
Statement Opposing Anti-LGBTQ+ State
Legislation. Learn more about our
diversity, equity and inclusion efforts
in the Talent and Diversity, Equity &
Inclusion section.
Freedom of Association

Citi has employees who are represented by
unions and works councils in a number of
countries where we operate. In addition,
a portion of our employee population
is covered by collective bargaining
agreements. We engage directly with our
employees and through these associations
to discuss issues such as health and safety,
remuneration, work hours, training, career
development, work time flexibility and
equal opportunity. Information related to
freedom of association is communicated
to employees through various mediums,
including employee handbooks, our
intranet and employee emails.
Extending Respect

for Human Rights

Through Our Suppliers

Our nondiscrimination policies extend
to Citi’s suppliers, and we do not work
with suppliers that are discovered to
discriminate on the basis of personal
characteristics, such as gender, race and
sexual orientation. Since 1977, we have
used our supplier diversity program to
empower communities around the world.
We communicate our approach to human
rights to our suppliers in our Statement
of Supplier Principles. Our approach is
reinforced by our Corporate Responsibility
Questionnaire (CRQ). This questionnaire
helps our procurement team determine
how potential and current suppliers
manage environmental and social issues,
including human rights issues.
Building on our prior efforts, we have
updated and expanded our CRQ to improve
supplier engagement and evaluation of
their operations. The latest assessment
expands on our previous questions in the
areas of modern slavery, supplier diversity,
environmental sustainability, corporate
responsibility, labor rights and workplace
safety. In addition, we have introduced
additional screening related to modern
slavery for suppliers in high-risk sectors
and countries.
Citi is committed to SDG 8 , which aims
to promote sustained, inclusive and
sustainable economic growth, full and
productive employment and decent work
for all. This is exemplified by our work to
fight modern slavery in our value chain,
along with our related reporting, policies,
due diligence and risk assessments. In
particular, our initiatives in these areas
address target 8.7 , which includes a
mandate to eradicate forced labor, end
modern slavery and human trafficking
and end child labor in all its forms.
SDG Goal 8: Decent Work and Economic
Growth
MODERN SLAVERY
DISCLOSURES
Each year, we disclose our
approach to identifying and
mitigating the risks of modern
slavery in our operations
(including client transactions)
and in our supply chain. The
disclosures cover information
about our governance and
policies related to modern
slavery, risk assessment and due
diligence processes, and training.
In 2021, we released our first
Modern Slavery Statement
specific to Australia.

CITI 2021 ESG REPORT 129

Respecting Human

Rights in Our

Financing Decisions

Effectively evaluating human rights risks

related to our clients and the projects we

finance is challenging. We work diligently

to meet this challenge and respect the

human rights of the individuals and

communities impacted by the clients we

finance and their projects.

We have established policies and practices

that help us influence the protection of

human rights. For instance, our anti-money

laundering efforts help us prevent crimi-

nally sourced funds — including funds asso-

ciated with human rights abuses, such as

human trafficking — from passing through

our bank. Disrupting the flow of money to

those perpetrating human rights abuses

and denying those abusers safe harbor for

illicit proceeds tied to corruption or human

rights violations are effective ways to

undermine their efforts.

Additionally, under our U.S. Commercial

Firearms Policy, adopted in 2018, we

require clients or partners that are

U.S. firearms retailers or firearms

manufacturers that sell through U.S.

retail channels to adhere to a set of best

practices regarding the sale of firearms.

For retailers, these practices include

selling firearms only to individuals who

have completed a background check, not

selling high-capacity magazines or bump

stocks (which modify semiautomatic

firearms to fire faster, at rates comparable

to fully automatic firearms), and selling

firearms to individuals under age 21 only if

they have received firearms safety training

(e.g., as part of active or former military or

law enforcement employment or via hunter

safety training). For manufacturers, best

practice entails selling firearms only to

retailers that follow these same practices.

Such examples illustrate our ability to
proactively avoid certain business trans-
actions with adverse impacts on human
rights, but other situations can occur
in which the link between our financial
services and human rights impacts is less
direct. That complexity may mean we have
less leverage, and it diminishes our ability
to ensure that on-the-ground outcomes
are consistent with Citi’s values. In these
instances, we work to improve our clients’
awareness and business practices. In
addition, where a transaction’s financial
and legal structure allows it, we put loan
covenants in place and monitor mitigation
efforts through our ESRM systems and
corrective action plans.
Due Diligence in Client

Transactions

Citi has thousands of corporate and insti-
tutional clients. The UN Guiding Principles
acknowledge the challenges presented
by extensive business relationships, and
we have adopted the approach set out in
the UN Guiding Principles of prioritizing
our due diligence and risk mitigation first
in areas where the risk of adverse human
rights impact is most significant from the
perspective of the people who may be
affected.
We use our ESRM Policy, where applicable,
to assess and manage risks consis-
tently and to evaluate client operations
against a common set of standards
grounded in international best practice,
including the UN Guiding Principles on
Business and Human Rights, ILO Forced
Labour Indicators, Voluntary Principles
on Security and Human Rights, and
International Finance Corporation (IFC)
Performance Standards, among other
international human rights norms and
emerging standards. Our ESRM team
screens transactions covered by our
ESRM Policy during the initial marketing
Contents ESG at Citi Sustainable Finance Sustainable Progress Equitable & Resilient Communities Talent & DEI Risk Management & Responsible Business Appendices

CITI 2021 ESG REPORT 130

phase to identify potential heightened

environmental or social risks related to

the client. Our policy prohibits financing

any project for which our due diligence

identifies the use of forced labor, harmful

or exploitative child labor, or when the

relevant labor forces have been subjected

to human trafficking. Under the ESRM

Policy, Citi screens for human rights

risks in project-related transactions and
clients subject to ESRM sector-specific
requirements. In addition, the ESRM Policy
includes Areas of High Caution, which
identify flags for heightened human rights
risk factors to escalate to the specialized
ESRM team for review regardless of finan-
cial product or sector.
If, during our initial screening for a trans-
action, we find a risk of adverse impacts,
we conduct more in-depth due diligence,
and we evaluate the client’s commitment
and capacity to avoid, mitigate and/or
manage those impacts in accordance
with international industry best practices
and human rights norms and the client’s
willingness to continuously improve. We
escalate the most challenging cases with
the highest potential for adverse impacts
to senior business and risk managers for
collective discussion on the risks and the
client’s commitment and capacity. In some
cases, senior management will conclude
that the likelihood for adverse impacts
is too great — posing an imminent threat
to people or communities — and we will
decline involvement in the transaction. In
severe circumstances, where we cannot
otherwise effectively influence different
human rights outcomes despite our best
efforts of sustained engagement, we will
end the client relationship. This is a move
we take very seriously, since we recognize
that it can have a number of ramifica-
tions, including removing any leverage
we might otherwise have had to improve
practices over time through constructive
engagement.
After the financial close of a transaction
or a client onboarding that was subject
to a time-bound environmental and social
action plan, we monitor the company’s
implementation of those actions. For
project-related transactions this often
involves the retention of an independent
environmental and social risk consultant
who periodically reports to lenders after
on-the-ground audits. In addition, for
non-project related transactions where
human rights risks have been flagged for
ongoing monitoring, our ESRM team uses
annual client credit reviews as touchpoints
to assess progress on human-rights-
related issues.
Protection of

Indigenous Rights

in Latin America

Citi understands that Indigenous
Peoples’ distinct identities,
languages, beliefs, cultural values,
lands and use of natural resources
may be under threat, representing
a higher degree of vulnerability.
Activities that may impact
Indigenous People have long been
acknowledged as an Area of High
Caution under our ESRM Policy, and
require enhanced due diligence.
In 2021, we put additional emphasis
on the evaluation of our Latin
American oil and gas clients and
mining clients during new trans-
actions and annual credit reviews,
to continue identifying clients
with operations that may overlap
Indigenous territories. All clients
were assessed on their community
engagement and biodiversity
management practices. When
overlap with Indigenous territories
was identified, Citi engaged clients
to assess how they incorporated
free, prior and informed consent
into their engagement practices
with Indigenous Peoples.

CITI 2021 ESG REPORT 131

Identifying Human Rights Risks in Transactions

Citi’s ESRM team screens transactions under the ESRM Policy for potential human rights risks. The specific types of human rights risks we screen for

are outlined in the table below. Further data related to ESRM Policy screening can be found in the Environmental and Social Risk Management section.

When human rights risks are identified for a project-related transaction during screening, the ESRM team may either decline to approve the oppor-

tunity outright, if the risks are deemed too high to address, or we may outline what further due diligence would be needed for the transaction to

proceed. There are a number of reasons why initial opportunities may not move forward, including a client declining to move forward with our due

diligence review requirements.

If an opportunity progresses to the due diligence phase, our requirements include gaining access to project information that allows us to benchmark

according to relevant standards, such as the IFC Performance Standards, UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, ILO Forced Labour

Indicators and the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights among other international human rights norms. In project-related lending this

due diligence would be supported by a qualified independent consultant. In circumstances where a project is not aligned with applicable international

standards, we will not approve financing until we are satisfied that the client has appropriate plans and capacity to mitigate project risks. For

example, in 2021 we declined a project-related financing opportunity for an industrial agricultural project in Africa with concerns related to involun-

tary resettlement, child labor and biodiversity impacts.

For general corporate-level transactions (e.g., renewing revolving credit facilities, issuing corporate bonds) that have elevated human rights risks,

we have less direct leverage than in project-related financing, but we review our clients’ policies and practices relevant to human rights issues to

evaluate their ability to avoid, manage and minimize these risks. We also engage our clients to understand their implementation of those policies and

whether they have appropriate staffing to manage these issues, and we review and encourage strong disclosures of human rights policies.

Human Rights Risks Screened During Transaction Reviews

Conflict Risk: Project-induced conflict risk, which may be tied to competition for resources or land

Cultural Heritage: Properties and sites of archaeological, historical, cultural, artistic and religious significance;
unique environmental features and cultural knowledge; intangible forms of culture embodying traditional lifestyles
Environmental Justice: Potential environmental risks to historically marginalized communities, especially
surrounding industrial developments
Indigenous Peoples: Concerns regarding the extent to which Indigenous communities are consulted during project
development and have consented to impacts to their land, livelihood and cultural heritage
Labor Risks: Risks related to labor forces used in the construction of projects or other operations, including those
associated with forced labor, child labor and human trafficking by project operators and their subcontractors
Resettlement: Resettlement of local communities, including Indigenous groups, as necessary for project
implementation; requires resettlement action plans and should include efforts to gain the free, prior and informed
consent of Indigenous communities
Security Practices: Concerns about how project sponsors engage with public or private security forces protecting
project sites
Water: Project-related impacts that hinder access to water or negatively affect water quality for local communities

CITI 2021 ESG REPORT 132

Providing Access

to Remedy

The UN Guiding Principles call on

governments and companies to play their

respective roles in ensuring that victims of

human rights abuse have access to effec-

tive remedy. Remedy can take many differ-

ent forms, including apologies, financial

or nonfinancial compensation, or efforts

to prevent future harm through policy

commitments and changes in operational

practice. The purpose of remedy is to help

make victims whole again or to restore

them, as much as possible, to their lives

and enjoyment of their rights before those

rights were violated. Remedy can also help

ensure that they and others will not suffer

similar harm in the future.

When we are made aware of a potentially

severe adverse human rights impact,

our approach to remedy usually involves

working with clients to ensure they have the

right policies in place and that channels are

available to enable victims to lodge griev-

ances. In addition, in line with our ability

to prioritize adverse impacts based on

severity, we will encourage clients to follow

up on allegations and to have established

processes to offer remedy or to cooperate

with authorities to make sure effective

remedy is provided. For example, in 2021,

as the result of our portfolio review in

Malaysia related to forced labor and related

client engagement, several clients have

improved their practices in this area, or

are in the process of doing so, by providing

workers compensation for recruitment fees

and constructing better accommodations

to house those working for them.

Learning and

Engagement

Engaging Stakeholders

To ensure that we are living up to our

commitment to respect human rights and

anticipate emerging risks, we regularly
communicate our approach externally,
engage with stakeholders on their issues
of concern and work to advance respect
for human rights more broadly.
During 2021, we led an Equator Principles
Association collaboration with Shift to
develop enhanced guidance for EP finan-
cial institutions for evaluating adequate
grievance mechanisms and access to
remedy. Citi is also a member of the Shift
Financial Institutions Practitioners Circle,
through which we participate in workshops
related to skill building on human rights
due diligence for ESRM practitioners and
deep dives into emerging salient human
rights risks. This collaboration has helped
us refine our approach to forced labor and
human rights in the Asia Pacific region.
In addition, we continued to pay close
attention to human rights issues raised
by stakeholders regarding specific indus-
tries. In 2021, concerns were raised by
stakeholders relating to the oil and gas,
manufacturing, technology and palm oil
sectors. We engage with these industries
directly through client relationships, stake-
holder meetings and active participation in
relevant initiatives. For instance, our partic-
ipation in the Roundtable on Sustainable
Palm Oil enables us to engage with multiple
stakeholders connected to the palm oil
value chain, to improve the collective effort
to reduce human rights risks associated
with this commodity. In addition, our touch
points during annual reviews allow us to
evaluate human rights risks and manage-
ment through client engagements.
Although banks are often under pressure
to disclose specific findings related to
client projects, we are bound by legal
requirements related to confidentiality
that limit our ability to disclose such infor-
mation without client consent. As a result,
addressing requests for transparency is
a balancing act between protecting the
confidentiality of our clients’ information
and disclosing information to stakeholders
as appropriate to advance the protection
of human rights.
Reporting Mechanisms

for Stakeholders

Our Ethics Hotline provides a way for our
employees, suppliers and other external
stakeholders, including the public, to
report concerns about unethical behavior
to Citi’s Ethics Office. Stakeholders and
whistleblowers can report violations to the
Ethics Hotline using a 24-hour phone line,
email address, fax line, website or physical
mailing address.
In addition, for project-related finance,
we apply the Equator Principles to assess
and manage environmental and social
risks. This includes an assessment of the
project sponsor’s stakeholder engagement
process, as well as its operational-level
grievance mechanisms that allow affected
communities to raise concerns proactively
with the project developers.
Employee Training

Human rights content is integrated into
the training we provide for the employees
responsible for implementing our ESRM
Policy and in our Code of Conduct train-
ing, which is required of all employees.
In recent years, we have developed a
comprehensive training module on modern
slavery, which we provided to our Resource
Management Organization (our employees
responsible for procurement and supply
chain activities). In 2021, we updated that
training with the goal of expanding it to
other functions globally.

Responsible

Sourcing

As a global firm that engages with

thousands of suppliers across

the world, our commitment to

responsible sourcing can have

wide-ranging effects. Citi’s goal

is to have a positive impact on

people, the environment and the

economy through our supply chain

decisions. We seek to work with

suppliers that share our values,

and we set high standards for

performance, measurement and

responsible business practices.

We are committed to providing more

opportunities for certified diverse suppli-

ers. Citi’s Supply Chain Development,

Inclusion and Sustainability (SCDIS)

Program provides the framework and

governance that guide Citi employees

to make sourcing decisions that support

inclusive processes and increase our roster

of diverse suppliers. Additionally, the

SCDIS Program works across our supply

chain to enhance sustainability practices,

while mitigating social and environmental

risks for all suppliers.

Supplier Diversity

Citi is committed to integrating supplier

diversity across our entire business. Our

SCDIS team sets clear supplier diversity

goals and embeds them in our sourcing

processes. Every bid over $250,000

requires the consideration of diverse firms.

Promoting the inclusion of diverse suppli-

ers in the bidding process helps us to build

a supplier base that more fully represents

the communities we serve.

Racial Equity

One of Citi’s Action for Racial Equity
commitments is investment in Black
entrepreneurship, which includes a goal to
increase our overall spend with certified
diverse suppliers to $1 billion annually,
including $250 million with Black-owned
firms. We achieved over $1 billion in diverse
supplier spend in 2021. We have also estab-
lished a task force that meets bi-weekly
to review progress against our supplier
diversity goals, evaluate spend with diverse
suppliers and discuss new opportunities
with broader initiatives across the company.
In 2021, we introduced more than 200
diverse suppliers, who have expertise in
information technology staffing, learning
and development, customer experience,
neurodiversity, career entry, and advertising
and marketing, to Citi business leaders.
Supplier Policies

Citi has detailed standards and policies, which guide responsible sourcing
initiatives and communicate our expectations related to environmental and social
issues to our suppliers:
The Citi Statement of Supplier Principles outlines the foundational guidelines
for our sustainable supply chain initiatives, including those related to human
rights in the workplace, ethical business practices, implementation of required
management systems and environmental sustainability.
The Citi Requirements for Suppliers provides detailed processes and procedures
that our suppliers must follow for contractual compliance and facilitates
awareness of other key Citi policy obligations.
We also ask suppliers to abide by the Citi Statement on Human Rights. For more
information about our approach in this area, see the Human Rights section.
Consistent with applicable modern slavery regulations, Citi publishes disclosures
outlining our approach to identifying and mitigating the risks of modern slavery in
our operations and supply chain.

In addition to increasing our spend with

diverse suppliers, we have an Action for

Racial Equity commitment to strengthen

Citi’s policies and practices to become an

anti-racist institution. This includes expand-

ing Citi’s capital market activities with

minority-owned broker-dealers to assist

with business and franchise development.

In 2021, we engaged diverse broker-

dealers to participate in 92% of Citi’s

benchmark debt issuances, including 100%

of our USD transactions. During the year,

we also issued our first Citi Social Finance

bond, with a notional value of $1 billion.

For this transaction, we worked with a

syndicate of minority- and women-owned

businesses, of which Black-owned broker-

dealers comprised approximately 20%. In

addition, to commemorate Martin Luther

King Jr. Day, we worked exclusively with

Black-owned broker-dealers to syndicate a

$2.5 billion bond issuance.

To promote additional opportunities, we

host an annual breakfast, during which

our diverse broker-dealers can share best

practices and network with Citi leaders.

Women-Owned Businesses

Citi is committed to procuring goods and

services from women-owned businesses

and identifying opportunities for these

firms, with an emphasis in developing

markets. In 2021, we procured $172 million

in goods and services from women-owned

businesses.

During 2021, Citi participated in

WEConnect International sessions for

women-owned businesses globally,

that emphasized diversity and supply

chain development and sustainability.

We also joined WEConnect matchmaker

and supplier showcase sessions in Latin

America that enabled women-owned

businesses to present their capabilities

and make connections with Citi’s procure-

ment colleagues. Similarly, Citi Indonesia

was part of capacity-building workshops
held by WEConnect to strengthen market
access for women-owned businesses.
We worked with the Women’s Business
Enterprise National Council (WBENC) to
expand our Bridge built by CitiSM program, a
lending platform that connects businesses
with local banks for loans. Through this
partnership, Citi collaborated with WBENC
to identify more than 2,000 women-owned
businesses based in locations where the
Bridge built by Citi program lending oppor-
tunity is available to them.
Additionally, we rolled out an initiative with
our major IT suppliers in India to further
the participation of women in technology.
This included sessions with suppliers to
discuss best practices for recruitment,
hiring, retention and career progression
for women, as well as a “Return to Career”
program focused on bringing women back
into the workforce who were on sabbatical
or long leave.
Our efforts to support women-owned
businesses align with SDG 5: Achieve
gender equality and empower all women
and girls. Our work in this area helps
address target 5.5 , which aims to ensure
women’s full and effective participation
and equal opportunities for leadership at
all levels of decision-making in political,
economic, and public life.
SDG Goal 5: Gender Equality
Building Capabilities

of Diverse Suppliers

The SCDIS team provides U.S.-based small
firms and women-, veteran-, disability-,
LGBTQ+- and minority-owned businesses
access to business opportunities, training
and mentoring. Our team identifies diverse
suppliers, including small businesses
that can meet our supply chain needs,
then subsequently works to build their
capabilities.
In 2021, we established our Mentor-
Protégé program, designed to strengthen
our diverse suppliers’ capabilities and
expand their opportunities both inside and
outside Citi. Through this program, Citi
connects established Tier 1 suppliers with
minority-, Black-, and/or women-owned
Tier 2 suppliers in a mentoring relation-
ship. This provides smaller, diverse suppli-
ers with an opportunity to gain valuable
experience in financial services and build
important skills to help them compete in
the marketplace. One successful pairing
within this program is that of mentor
company Tata Consultancy Services (TCS),
a Tier 1 supplier offering IT & Operations
services to Citi, and protégé firm
Technology Concepts Group International
(TCGi), a Black-, woman-owned supplier
that provides IT services to TCS for the
benefit of Citi. The unique element of this
pairing is that TCS has contextualized and
structured the mentorship around TCGi’s
current challenges and shifted gears from
COLLABORATING TO BUILD SUPPLIER DIVERSITY

In addition to advancing our own supplier diversity, our SCDIS team engages
with others to support broader supplier diversity efforts. Our memberships
with mission-centric organizations include the National LGBT Chamber of
Commerce, WEConnect International, WBENC and the National Minority
Supplier Development Council (NMSDC) along with several of its global part-
ners, including the Canadian Aboriginal and Minority Supplier Council, the
South African Supplier Diversity Council, Minority Supplier Development UK
and Supply Nation in Australia.

training to capability building. As a result,

TCGi is building holistic expertise including

technical, functional and soft skills.

We continue to host events for diverse

businesses across the globe to share best

practices for doing business with Citi and

other large companies. Our global “Doing

Business with Citi” session is open to any

supplier affiliated with select diversity

certification agencies. The 2021 event had

nearly 700 attendees, most of whom were

diverse suppliers.

In addition, Citi participated in the NMSDC

Emerging Entrepreneurs Program, which

includes a new mentoring approach called

Success Circles. Entrepreneurs are placed

with a group of experts who use their

collective talents and connections to help

the entrepreneurs build their businesses.

Citi also provided a scholarship to the

Tuck School of Business Minority Business

Enterprise Program as part of this
initiative.
During 2021, we collaborated with the
New York & New Jersey Minority Supplier
Development Council to host the 11th
annual Sustainability Symposium, where
Citi hosted and moderated a Sustainability
panel. Panelists shared perspectives on
supply chain sustainability, ESG metrics,
human rights, net zero carbon emissions
programs and the impact of COVID-19
on business growth. The panel included
leaders from Citi, UN Women, Ernst &
Young and Accenture.
We continue to support the Broad-Based
Black Economic Empowerment (BBBEE)
program in South Africa, maintaining a
Level 3 BBBEE Scorecard for the inclusion
of diverse suppliers during 2020/2021 for
local operations.
Supplier Engagement

and Evaluation

Since 2013, the SCDIS team has used a
Corporate Responsibility Questionnaire
(CRQ) to gauge how effectively our suppli-
ers are managing critical issues, such as
human rights, environmental manage-
ment, health and safety, labor practices
and diversity.
In 2020, we began rolling out an updated
version of this evaluation tool, which
includes an expanded assessment in
the areas of modern slavery, supplier
diversity, environmental sustainability,
corporate responsibility, labor rights and
workplace safety. This latest version of
the CRQ brings more rigor to our supplier
assessment process and will continue to
raise the bar for our ESG practices across
Citi’s supply chain. It is also helping raise
awareness about supply chain corporate

responsibility with our colleagues across

the company.

Our goal is for all suppliers to complete the

CRQ every two years. This helps improve

environmental and social practices

throughout our supply chain.

Supply Chain

Sustainability

Focus Areas

Citi has three sustainability focus areas

for our supply chain: paper and paper

products, IT hardware and e-waste

disposal, and travel and logistics. We have

developed actions for each of these areas
and incorporated them into our supply
chain Global Operating Procedures.
As a result of choosing EPEAT-certified
options for 99% of our deployed servers,
laptops, desktop computers, monitors and
mobile phones, we estimate an energy
savings of 273 million kilowatt-hours and
a greenhouse gas reduction of 57,200
metric tons of CO 2 over the life cycle of the
products.
In support of responsible forestry, Citi
made a commitment in 2020 to use
Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) Chain
of Custody-certified paper for the outer
envelopes used for statements and
customer communications. During 2021,
we made the transition to and began using
FSC-certified paper for outer envelopes.
We also began integrating a requirement
for FSC-certified bulk roll paper (used for
printing statements) into our Request for
Proposal (RFP) process. However, we have
paused this effort due to global supply
chain disruptions that have posed serious
challenges to sourcing adequate amounts
of FSC-certified paper. We will reassess
whether it is possible to move forward with
updated RFPs in 2022 and continue to
advance our use of digital alternatives.

409-1 Operations and suppliers at significant risk
for incidents of forced or compulsory labor
We have not identified any operations as having significant risk for incidents of forced or compulsory
labor. In addition, we do not directly source high-risk agricultural commodities, conflict minerals
or other raw materials in significant amounts from suppliers in high-risk jurisdictions. While our
own business operations and supply chain are not at high risk because of the nature of work in
the financial services industry, our ESRM policy includes processes to evaluate corporate clients

The Principles for Responsible Banking Index

The Principles for Responsible Banking (PRB) are a framework for ensuring that signatory banks’ strategy and practice align with Sustainable

Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris Climate Agreement (Paris Agreement). The Principles encourage a sustainable banking system and help

the industry demonstrate how it makes a positive contribution to society. They embed sustainability at the strategic, portfolio and transactional

large number of external principles and standards that inform our approach to
sustainable finance and risk management and allow us to provide innovative
financial services that enable growth and economic progress while meeting our
responsibilities to people and the planet. Please refer to our Environmental and
Social Policy Framework for a full list.

Principle 2: Impact and Target Setting
We will continuously increase our positive impacts while reducing the negative impacts on, and managing the risks to, people and environment resulting
from our activities, products and services. To this end, we will set and publish targets where we can have the most significant impacts.
2.1 Impact Analysis:
Show that your bank has identified the
areas in which it has its most significant
(potential) positive and negative impact
through an impact analysis that fulfills
the following elements:
a) Scope: The bank’s core business
areas, products/services across
the main geographies that the bank
operates in have been as described
under 1.1. have been considered in the
scope of the analysis.
b) Scale of Exposure: In identifying
its areas of most significant impact
the bank has considered where its
core business/its major activities lie in
terms of industries, technologies and
geographies.
c) Context & Relevance: Your bank
has taken into account the most
relevant challenges and priorities
related to sustainable development
in the countries/regions in which it
operates.
d) Scale and intensity/salience of
impact: In identifying its areas of
most significant impact, the bank has
considered the scale and intensity/
salience of the (potential) social,
economic and environmental impacts
resulting from the bank’s activities and
provision of products and services.
Show that building on this analysis, the
bank has
Identified and disclosed its areas of
most significant (potential) positive
and negative impact
Identified strategic business oppor-
tunities in relation to the increase
of positive impacts / reduction of
negative impacts
Introduction
Building on our track record of over 20 years of work on climate change,
sustainability and ESG issues, Citi’s approach to impact analysis is a process
that has developed organically for our priority strategic initiatives. Prior
to becoming a signatory to the Principles, we were engaged in this impact
assessment process and we continue to learn from it and adapt it to new
and emerging best practices. As such, our process involves concurrent
workstreams that provide continuous feedback for the monitoring of potential
impacts.
This integrated process aligns with the directional intent of the Principles
to “embed sustainability at the strategic, portfolio, and transactional levels
across all business areas.” We recognize that any approach towards impact
analysis is never complete, and the guidance developed by the PRB working
groups can be used to help complement our existing work. Additionally, for
financial institutions that are beginning their work to explore areas of greatest
impacts, we regard the Principles as an efficient framework for embarking on
this level of analysis.
We plan to use the Principles and reporting from our peers to benchmark the
impact areas we have identified and ensure that we are addressing society’s
needs in the regions in which we operate and the markets that we serve.
Citi’s Approach
Citi’s approach to impact consists of multiple concurrent processes,
summarized below. Note that these processes, as described, do not necessarily
occur in the order presented.
1. Feedback Pathways: To identify potential impact areas, we engage a number
of internal and external stakeholders, partners and tools, including:

a) Periodic stakeholder engagement:
Citi regularly reviews its stakeholder partnerships across a range of functions
including Global Public Affairs; Investor Relations; Human Resources and
Corporate Governance as well as Sustainability; Government Affairs and other
teams in Public Affairs. Examples of our stakeholder engagements from 202 1
are highlighted in the Stakeholder Engagement at Citi section of this report.
Furthermore, we periodically have feedback sessions for stakeholders
including clients, investors and NGOs facilitated by the nonprofit sustainability
advocacy organization Ceres. These sessions focus on areas such as our
Sustainable Progress Strategy and approach to addressing climate change
including, most recently, our setting of net zero targets and measurement of
baseline emissions. For more information, please see pages 26-27 of our 20 21
TCFD Report.
b) Partnerships with trade organizations:
Becoming a signatory to global industry initiatives and participating in
working groups keeps us abreast of emerging issues and best practices
for addressing them. Engagements with organizations such as the Equator
Principles, Institute of International Finance (IIF), United Nations Environment
Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI) and GISD highlight potential issues,
increasing awareness of our own potential impacts as a global bank. Such
involvement also allows for opportunities to support public policy and
regulation that encourages sustainable development.
c) Third-party ratings:
Analyses conducted by third-party organizations allow Citi to benchmark
our approaches to certain ESG issues against standardized frameworks and
methodologies. Such ratings and their accompanying reports identify areas for
improvement and provide useful data that can help drive performance.

d) Public-Private Partnerships:
Working with research organizations, academic institutions and in the case of our racial equity work, initiatives like the U.S. Treasury OCC’s Project REACh
(Roundtable for Economic Access and Change) allows Citi the opportunity to direct private sector resources towards public-sector initiatives while also providing
first-hand insight into the issues facing the clients, countries and communities with which we work.
2. Normalization of Feedback: Given the myriad streams of incoming feedback and the numerous potential impact areas identified by the pathways described above,
we use the following tools to help identify which areas are the most salient and actionable:

a) Materiality Assessments:
We periodically conduct materiality assessments to identify our most relevant (or “material”) reporting topics from an ESG perspective — which is a broader
standard than that used in our financial disclosures. Such assessments provide a methodological way to gauge and quantify the relative salience of potential
impact areas to our key stakeholders. This assessment also mirrors — and informs — our increased strategic efforts on these issues. It has also driven our increased
reporting on these material topics.
b) Research:
Citi maintains strong relationships with academic institutions, think tanks and industry groups that periodically publish reports highlighting developing trends and
areas of economic and social impact. Citi also considers research conducted by our thought leadership group, Citi Global Perspectives & Solutions (Citi GPS), which
analyzes the global economy’s most demanding challenges.
c) Consideration of core business areas, products/services and the geographies we work in:
Qualitative and quantitative factors such as market presence, sectoral exposure and revenue associated with certain businesses and regions may also contribute
to our assessment of our potential impacts.
Citi’s Initial Impact Areas
The following describes considerations taken as part of our ESG impact analysis approach, which identified our two areas of greatest impact: climate change
globally and racial equity in the United States.
Note: As mentioned in our response to disclosure 1.1 of this index, during 2021, Citi was managed pursuant to two operating segments, ICG and GCB, and and the
reporting structure changed in Q1 2022, as described on page 6 of our 2021 10-K. The findings below are based on the GCB and ICG reporting structure during
However, we believe the conclusions will be applicable to the new structure in 2022.
Scope and Scale:
In our initial review of potential impact areas, we consider our core business activities under our two primary segments, GCB and ICG, the regions they serve and
the revenues attributed to businesses within each.
Regions:
GCB: North America; Latin America; Asia
ICG: North America; Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA); Latin America; Asia
Core Business Activities:
GCB: Retail banking; Branded cards; Retail services*
ICG: Investment banking (advisory and equity and debt underwriting), Markets (fixed income markets, equity markets, securities services and other),
Treasury and trade solutions, Corporate lending and Private bank
* This GCB business is in North America only
Findings (Based on 2021 10-K filing):
GCB: In 2021, revenues for retail banking activity in Latin America and Asia were nearly double the revenue of branded cards in these regions. In North America,
the opposite was true, with branded cards exceeding retail banking revenues. However, absolute revenue from retail banking in North America was highest among
the three regions. Likewise, aggregate revenue for all three GCB businesses in North America exceeded Latin America and Asia combined.
ICG: Unlike GCB, which had a majority of its revenue concentrated in North America, revenues for aggregate ICG activity were more evenly distributed among the
primary regions, reflecting this segment’s global work. Among the highest revenue-generating activities were markets and securities services (particularly fixed
income activity) and treasury and trade solutions.
Additionally, we consider activity outside of our core businesses. For example, through strategic grant-making efforts, the Citi Foundation promotes economic
progress in low-income communities around the world, including programs that increase financial inclusion. The Citi Impact Fund is a $200 million venture capital
fund with a mission of investing in double bottom line companies that are addressing societal changes. The fund prioritizes companies that are led or owned by
women or racial/ethnic minorities and that are addressing societal challenges, such as reaching low- and moderate-income households with innovative financial and
workforce services, delivering solutions for the climate transition economy and addressing needs for inclusive healthcare and housing.
Initial Areas of Focus:
GCB: Based on the screening above, we focused on North America, given the concentration of revenue generation there, and focused on global activity for ICG.
While GCB revenue in North America during 2021 was driven by our branded cards activity, we feel that a focus on retail banking has more impact, considering the
potential societal benefits from small business lending and greater access to financial services and credit through programs like the Citi® Access Account Package.
ICG: Although our fixed income markets and treasury and trade solutions activity generated the most revenue during 2021, they serve to support market-making
activity and cash-management capacity for clients and thus have more indirect impact. We concluded that our corporate lending and underwriting activity is
the most directly associated with impact, and that through these activities we can be more influential and actionable. This is supported by our industry group
partnerships described in the Context and Relevance section below. Therefore, global corporate lending is the scope of our initial focus.

CITI 2021 ESG REPORT 158

High-Level Summary of Bank’s Response (continued)

We also consider activities of the Citi Foundation and Impact Fund, where they complement Citi’s ESG-related goals and efforts alongside our core business
activities. In the future we will consider corporate underwriting.
Context and Relevance
From the feedback pathways described in the Citi’s Approach section above, we maintain awareness of the most relevant sustainable development challenges and
priorities in the countries and regions in which we operate. Below, we discuss our focus on climate change mitigation globally and racial equity in the United States.
Global Context:
The climate crisis is one of the most critical challenges facing our global society and economy in the 21st century. The data is irrefutable and the world’s climate
scientists agree: Urgent action must be taken to address the current and potential impacts of climate change, including chronic changes to temperature and
precipitation, diminishing polar sea ice, rising sea levels and more intense and frequent extreme weather events. 2021 was the sixth warmest year on record. That
year, we experienced devastating wildfires on the West Coast of the U.S. and in Australia, and one of the most active hurricane seasons in the Atlantic. Additionally,
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC’s) 6th Assessment Report, released in 2021, further highlights the urgent need to address climate change.
Reports also show that vulnerable and marginalized communities are likely to bear a disproportionate share of any physical climate impacts.
U.S. Context:
A wide range of data and studies have found that many major gaps in economic opportunity, education, income, housing and wealth run along racial lines,
particularly between Black and white households. Some gaps remain wide 60 years after the civil rights movement and some, including in homeownership rates and
college degree attainment, are even wider now. These gaps have not only had implications for Black Americans and other people of color but the broader economy
as well. Over the last few years, the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on communities of color and growing demand for racial justice further highlighted the
impacts of racial inequity.
Intensity and Salience
Climate Change:
We have employed a number of tools to assess the intensity and salience of climate change impacts: We published baseline emissions for our Energy and Power
loan portfolios in accordance with the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) standard and established emissions targets, with intentions to analyze
the emissions of other carbon-intensive sectors in the future.
Several industry-wide initiatives also identify corporate lending as a key impact area with potential to mitigate climate change:
The PCAF standard was established to assess financed emissions with an initial focus on lending
The UNEP FI Guidelines for Climate Target Setting for Banks (“UNEP FI Guidelines”) focus on lending and investment activities
PCAF also formed a Capital Markets Working Group, with which Citi has been involved, to develop standards for measuring emissions associated with underwrit-
ing activity — an area of activity that Citi will also explore for its potential impacts.
Racial Equity:
For over 20 years, Citi and the Citi Foundation have invested in organizations and partnerships that support financial inclusion and expanding economic opportunities for low-
income families and communities of color, such as the Asset Building Policy Network. Through engagement with these and other stakeholders, including minority depository
institutions (MDIs), we have enhanced our understanding of the structural inequities that fuel the racial wealth gap and their impact on communities. Numerous publications and
research reports articulate the scale, intensity and salience of racial equity (see External References).
Additionally, the Citi GPS report, Closing the Racial Inequality Gaps, articulates the economic impacts of the racial wealth gap. The analysis in the report shows that if four key
racial gaps for Black people — wages, education, housing and investment — had been closed 20 years ago, $16 trillion could have been added to the U.S. economy. And if the gaps
were closed as of 2020, $5 trillion could have been added to U.S. GDP over the next five years.
Next Steps
Our work towards addressing our areas of greatest impact is never complete, and we anticipate the following areas of activity as we move toward further implementation of the
principles.
Climate Change:
As per our NZBA commitments, we will set targets for and establish baseline emissions for additional carbon-intensive sectors, such as Auto Manufacturing, Commercial
Real Estate, Steel and Thermal Coal Mining, with additional sectors such as Agriculture, Aluminum, Cement, Iron and other segments of the Transportation sector to follow, as
methodological capabilities evolve to accommodate them. Additionally, once a capital markets methodology is finalized and published by PCAF, Citi plans to integrate these
emissions into annual disclosures and targets.
Racial Equity:
As discussed in the Action for Racial Equity section of this report, we seek to lead and expand firmwide engagement with MDIs, diverse broker-dealers and diverse asset
managers through our newly formed Diverse Financial Institutions Group. We are also conducting a third-party racial equity audit to assess our efforts to address the racial
wealth gap in the United States through implementation of Action for Racial Equity.
Biodiversity:
We recognize that loss of biodiversity globally is an increasing emergency, and we are continuing to expand our understanding of the complex dynamics between climate and
biodiversity. These two topics are interconnected, and there are increasing concerns that climate change, along with other human activity, has significantly stressed natural
systems and contributed to ongoing extinction events. Although there is increasing focus on biodiversity, there has historically been limited information available to understand
how companies rely on and impact natural capital as well as natural capital’s impact on climate. Citi is a member of the Taskforce on Nature-Related Financial Disclosures (TNFD)
Forum and participated in an informal working group prior to the TNFD’s launch to develop its workplan to create a complementary framework to TCFD focused on reporting
evolving nature-related risks.
For our impact analysis, we have identified impacts associated with our core businesses and their portfolios as described in the introduction to this
section. We may further refine this process and increase the scope of our impact analysis as we explore different methodologies in subsequent reporting.

2.2 Target Setting
Show that the bank has set and
published a minimum of two Specific,
Measurable (can be qualitative or
quantitative), Achievable, Relevant and
Time-bound (SMART) targets, which
address at least two of the identified
“areas of most significant impact”,
resulting from the bank’s activities and
provision of products and services.
Show that these targets are linked to
and drive alignment with and greater
contribution to appropriate SDGs, the
goals of the Paris Agreement, and
other relevant international, national or
regional frameworks. The bank should
have identified a baseline (assessed
against a particular year) and have set
targets against this baseline.
Show that the bank has analysed and
acknowledged significant (potential)
negative impacts of the set targets on
other dimensions of the SDG/climate
change/society’s goals and that it has
set out relevant actions to mitigate
those as far as feasible to maximize the
net positive impact of the set targets.
As part of our initial impact analysis work, we have developed targets for each
of the identified impact areas:
Climate Change
Net Zero Commitment:
In 2021, we announced our commitment to net zero GHG emissions by 2050,
including net zero GHG emissions for our own operations by 2030. In early
2022, we published our initial net zero plan, baseline emissions and interim
2030 targets for our Energy and Power loan portfolios. For more information,
see the Climate Risk and Net Zero section of this report.
$1 Trillion Commitment to Sustainable Finance:
In 2021 we announced our $1 trillion sustainable finance by 2030 commitment,
which includes a $500 Billion Environmental Finance Goal toward the financing
and facilitation of a wide array of climate solutions, such as renewable energy,
clean technology, water conservation and sustainable transportation. The
$1 trillion commitment also includes $500 billion in social finance toward
investments in affordable basic infrastructure, affordable housing, diversity
and equity, economic inclusion, education, food security and healthcare.
Thermal Coal Mining Exposure:
Within our ESRM Policy, we have included a commitment to eliminate our
exposure to thermal coal mining companies by 2030, and in early 2021, we also
expanded our policy related to coal-fired power. For more information, see our
Environmental and Social Policy Framework.
These goals will drive alignment with SDGs 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), 9
(Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure) and 13 (Climate Action).
Racial Equity
Action for Racial Equity:
In 2020, Citi and the Citi Foundation committed $1 Billion in strategic
initiatives through 2023 to help close the racial wealth gap. Our pledge focuses
on four key goals and outcomes:
Expand banking and access to credit in communities of color
Invest in Black entrepreneurship
Invest in affordable housing and promote the growth of Black
homeownership
Strengthen Citi’s policies and practices in order to become an anti-racist
institution
These goals will drive alignment with SDGs 8 (Decent Work and Economic
Growth) and 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities).

additional carbon-intensive sectors in our portfolio.
$1 Trillion Sustainable Finance Goal:
Building on our $250 Billion Environmental Finance Goal, we announced a
commitment to a $1 trillion in sustainable finance by 2030. The commitment
expands the prior $250 Billion Environmental Goal to $500 Billion and
includes $500 Billion toward Social Finance. Detailed progress toward the first
two years of tracking toward this commitment is provided in the Sustainable
Finance section of this report. As of YE2021, we have financed and facilitated
$163.1 billion toward our Environmental Finance Goal and $59.0 billion toward
our Social Finance Goal for a total of $222.1 billion toward the $1 trillion
commitment.
Thermal Coal Mining Exposure:
Following the publication of the 2020 baseline, we saw a reduction of 30% in
2021, as detailed in this report.
Action for Racial Equity:
By November 2021, one year into our three-year pledge, Citi and the Citi
Foundation had already exceeded our $1 billion commitment to invest in
initiatives expanding economic opportunity for communities of color. For more

3.2 Describe how your bank has worked
with and/or is planning to work with its
clients and customers to encourage
sustainable practices and enable
sustainable economic activities. This
should include information on actions
planned/implemented, products
and services developed, and, where
possible, the impacts achieved.
Through our $1 trillion commitment to sustainable finance, we will finance
and facilitate a wide array of climate solutions, such as renewable energy,
clean technology, water conservation and sustainable transportation as
well as activities in social finance, which include investments in education,
affordable housing and basic infrastructure, healthcare, economic inclusion
and food security. Reaching the goal will require the development of innovative
financing solutions, increasing engagement and helping clients across all
sectors, no matter where they are in their own sustainability journeys, to
enable more sustainable business models and practices. For more information,
please see the Sustainable Finance section in this report.
To facilitate these transitions, we have established dedicated teams embedded
across our businesses to offer strategic sustainability and ESG services
and solutions. Our business groups, including Banking, Capital Markets and
Advisory; Global Markets; Global Wealth Management; and Treasury and Trade
Solutions, all have dedicated bankers or teams focused on advising clients and
offering customized ESG-themed products and services.
Under our net zero commitment, we will engage clients in carbon-intensive
sectors that have low-carbon transition opportunities. We have formed
specialized business units to work closely with clients to support their
business plans as they transition to net zero including the Natural Resources &
Clean Energy Transition team; the Sustainability & Corporate Transitions team;
and the Sustainable Debt Capital Markets team. For more information, please
see our 2021 TCFD Report.
Our ESRM Policy helps us finance projects and activities responsibly by
engaging our clients on environmental and social risks and good practices.
Ongoing engagement with our clients is an important part of our ESRM
process. When we first established our ESRM Policy, our engagements were
tied to specific, project-related financial transactions and their associated
environmental and social risks and mitigation efforts. However, as we have
developed Sector Approaches and Areas of High Caution over the years, we
have added corporate-level reviews and client engagements in a number of
sectors. These sector-specific risk review processes encourage dialogue
between Citi and our clients about the material environmental and social
risks associated with their operations, enabling us to develop a better
understanding of prevailing industry practices and our clients’ performance
and guide our clients toward better sustainability practices.

Principle 5: Governance & Culture
We will implement our commitment to these Principles through effective governance and a culture of responsible banking.
5.1 Describe the relevant governance
structures, policies and procedures
your bank has in place/is planning
to put in place to manage significant
positive and negative (potential)
impacts and support effective
implementation of the Principles.
Citi’s Board of Directors plays an important role in providing oversight of our
efforts to ensure responsible business practices. For example, the Nomination,
Governance and Public Affairs Committee (NGPAC) of the Board oversees Citi’s
global ESG activities and performance, and the Risk Management Committee
(RMC) provides oversight of Citi’s Risk Management function, reviews Citi’s
risk appetite framework, including reputational risk appetite, and reviews key
risk policies, including those focused on environmental and social risk. The
Ethics, Conduct and Culture Committee of the Board oversees management’s
efforts to foster a culture of ethics within the company and receives regular
reports from senior management on the progress of those efforts.
In 2021, we formed a new Global ESG Council consisting of senior members
of management in order to provide enhanced oversight of our ESG activities
and goals. Additionally, to support the development and launch of our net
zero plan, we formed a Net Zero Task Force in 2021. The Task Force, led by our
CSO, includes leaders from diverse business units and many other functions
throughout Citi.
Citi also has a Global Sustainability Steering Committee, a senior-level
committee formed to advise on our sustainability and climate change strategy.
For more details on governance for ESG and sustainability issues, please refer

change governance, please see our 2021 TCFD Report.

High-Level Summary of Bank’s Response References

5.2 Describe the initiatives and
measures your bank has implemented
or is planning to implement to foster a
culture of responsible banking among
its employees. This should include a
high-level overview of capacity building,
inclusion in remuneration structures
and performance management and
leadership communication, amongst
others.
Citi has implemented a number of programs and initiatives that instill a culture
of responsible banking among its employees, listed below:
Cod e of Conduct:
Citi’s Code of Conduct outlines the standards of ethics and professional
behavior expected of employees and representatives of Citi when dealing with
clients, business colleagues, shareholders, communities and each other. It
also provides an overview of key legal and regulatory requirements and select
global policies. Citi’s Code of Conduct applies to all directors, officers and
employees of Citi worldwide. Upon joining Citi, employees must acknowledge
that they have read and will comply with our Code.
Programs and Training:
Citi has policies, procedures and internal controls to comply with anti-bribery
laws, and we conduct an annual bribery risk assessment of all global business
lines. We provide our staff with anti-bribery training annually and supplement
it with targeted training and communications as needed.
Citi’s Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Program protects our clients, our
franchise and the global financial system from the risks of money laundering
and terrorist financing. The program includes more than 5,600 employees
globally, including 225 designated AML Country Officers covering every Citi
business, function and geographic area.
Global Financial Crimes Investigations and Intelligence (GFCII) tackles
financial crime and provides a globally consistent approach to the prevention
and detection of risk. GFCII leverages partnerships with law enforcement,
nonprofits and internal stakeholders to obtain actionable intelligence, allowing
for proactive identification of illicit activity and effective mitigation of risk.
Our Sanctions Program includes policies and procedures, risk category
statement and tolerance thresholds, enterprise-wide screening, annual risk
assessments and audits of sanctions control processes, employee training and
a diverse team of Compliance professionals stationed around the world.
For more information, please see Managing Corruption and Tax-Related Risks
section of this report.
ESRM Training:
Key risk and banking personnel are provided with annual training on our ESRM
Policy to help them identify triggers for engagement with our specialist ESRM
team. For more information, please see the ESRM Management section of this
report.
Serving Our Customers and Clients Responsibly:
We have policies and systems in place to help ensure that we treat customers
responsibly and fairly including our Code of Conduct, responsible marketing
practices, our Treating Customers Fairly Principles, our Global Financial
Access Policy and our Global Consumer Fairness Policy.
Remuneration:
The Personnel and Compensation Committee of the Board holds senior
executives responsible, and in turn senior executives hold their team
members responsible, for managing our sustainability and other ESG-
related efforts through incentive compensation decisions. Citi’s incentive
compensation program is discretionary, not formulaic. For details on ESG-
linked remuneration for key executives and managers, please refer to the
Remuneration section of this report.

5.3 Governance Structure for
Implementation of the Principles
Show that your bank has a
governance structure in place for the
implementation of the PRB, including:
a) target-setting and actions to achieve
targets set
b) remedial action in the event of
targets or milestones not being
achieved or unexpected negative
impacts being detected.
Our Sustainability & ESG team, in collaboration with partners across the
bank, is responsible for developing sustainability and climate-related targets,
monitoring progress toward their achievement to ensure we are on track
and identifying and addressing any unexpected negative impacts. Our Chief
Sustainability Officer, Head of Community Investing and Development and
other senior executives have oversight over target-setting, measures put in
place to achieve the targets and determining remedial action where targets
are not on track, or where measures need to be put in place to address
unforeseen negative impacts.
We track our progress toward achieving our targets via reports to the NGPAC
and/or the full Board of Directors. The Chief Sustainability Officer and Head
of Community Investing and Development periodically report to the Board on
progress made with achieving our targets and any remedial action taken to
ensure achievement of targets and/or how negative impacts were addressed.
Reports are also provided to the Global ESG council on a periodic basis
for progress towards our Action for Racial Equity commitments, $1 trillion
sustainable finance commitment and net zero targets.

Our Transformation > Ethics and
Culture at Citi
We have progressed substantially in fulfilling this requirement. The firm has a governance structure with oversight of ESG issues and will ensure that
the Principles are implemented, managing significant impacts and setting and monitoring targets. The Sustainability & ESG team leads day-to-day
implementation of the Principles in concert with other teams throughout the organization.
Principle 6: Transparency & Accountability
We will periodically review our individual and collective implementation of these Principles and be transparent about and accountable for our positive
and negative impacts and our contribution to society’s goals.
6.1 Progress on Implementing the
Principles for Responsible Banking
Show that your bank has progressed
on implementing the six Principles over
the last 12 months (up to 18 months in
your first reporting after becoming a
signatory) in addition to the setting and
implementation of targets in minimum
two areas (see 2.1-2.4).
Show that your bank has considered
existing and emerging international/
regional good practices relevant for the
implementation of the six Principles for
Responsible Banking. Based on this, it
has defined priorities and ambitions to
align with good practice.
Show that your bank has implemented/
is working on implementing changes
in existing practices to reflect and
be in line with existing and emerging
international/regional good practices
and has made progress on its
implementation of these Principles.
In 2021, Citi made considerable progress toward implementing the Principles
and our targets, as described below.
Net Zero Commitment:
In January 2022, we released our initial net zero plan, including baseline
emissions and 2030 emissions reduction targets for our Energy and Power
loan portfolios. Additionally, in developing our initial net zero plan, we have
participated in key net zero frameworks, including our continued participation
in PCAF as well as the NZBA and the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero
(GFANZ) of which we are founding members. For more information on these
organizations and how they serve as converging net zero guideposts across
the financial industry, please see our 2021 TCFD Report.
Citi remains committed to working closely with clients to support their
business plans as they transition to net zero. In March 2021, we created the
Natural Resources & Clean Energy Transition team in order to drive client
engagement efforts in the Energy, Power and Chemicals sectors. This team
includes corporate and investment bankers with deep knowledge of these
sectors and unites them under a single umbrella to more effectively evaluate
and pursue opportunities to assist our clients with the net zero transition.
$1 Trillion Sustainable Finance Commitment:
We recently established a $1 trillion by 2030 sustainable finance commitment,
which expands our Environmental Finance Goal to $500 billion, with a focus
on circular economy, clean technology, energy efficiency, green buildings,
renewable energy, sustainable agriculture and land use, sustainable
transportation and water quality and conservation. This commitment
also includes $500 billion in social finance activity in affordable basic
infrastructure, affordable housing, diversity and equity, economic inclusion,
education, food security and healthcare. The expanded emphasis on social
finance allows Citi to address a more holistic set of societal needs, in
addition to protecting the environment and fighting global climate change, all
supporting the UN SDGs. Multiple businesses and banking teams across Citi
contribute environmental and social activities that count toward the $1 trillion
sustainable finance commitment. Progress toward the $1 trillion commitment
can be found in the Sustainable Finance section of this report.

High-Level Summary of Bank’s Response (continued)

Climate Risk:
In early 2022, we released our 2021 TCFD Report, detailing our continued work to incorporate climate risk and opportunity identification and management into
our overall business strategy and efforts. Additionally, during 2021, we expanded our climate change governance through the formation of a Global ESG Council,
consisting of senior members of management. We also grew our dedicated Climate Risk team to accommodate additional areas of expertise. For more information,
please see our 2021 TCFD Report.
Action for Racial Equity:
By November 2021 — one year into our three-year pledge — Citi and the Citi Foundation had already invested $1 billion into initiatives expanding economic
opportunity for communities of color, putting us on track to exceed our original $1.1 billion commitment set in 2020. In 2021, we created a Diverse Financial
Institutions Group, a dedicated team within Citi that is serving as a hub to lead and expand firmwide engagement with MDIs, diverse broker-dealers and diverse
asset managers. Additionally, we have committed to conducting a Racial Equity Audit to evaluate our Action for Racial Equity work by the end of 2022. For more
information, see the Action for Racial Equity section in this report.
Engagement on SDGs:
Citi remains a member of the GISD Alliance, which includes 30 of the world’s largest investors committed to accelerating the financing of the SDGs.
Biodiversity:
Following our participation in the informal working group for the TNFD, we have become a member of the TNFD Forum. Through our ongoing collaboration with
TNFD, we are able to contribute to the development of nature-related reporting norms and standards and continue to refine our understanding of the complex
dynamics between climate and biodiversity and our connection to those impacts through our financial relationships with our clients.
Citi has made considerable progress towards implementing the principles including, identifying areas of impact, setting targets related to these impact
areas and setting up internal resources to support the implementation of these targets and the Principles throughout the firm.

In 2021, we identified risks of impacts to racial/ethnic minorities in global supply
chains. We took steps to mitigate the risks of our involvement in such impacts by
limiting the scope of our financing to clients in some cases and ceasing business
relationships in others. In particular, we enhanced our governance of human rights
risks in the Asia Pacific region with a special Human Rights Task Force and also
initiated a portfolio review of the Malaysia franchise, to evaluate forced labor
concerns in clients’ operations across different industries.

CONCLUSIONS WITH REGARDS TO EQUATOR PRINCIPLES REPORTING DATA FOR 2021
In our opinion the “Citi’s 2021 ESG Report” reported information of the Equator Principles, as detailed at the
section “ 2021 Projects Covered by Equator Principles” and is presented in accordance with the Equator
Principles IV (EP4), Annex B “Minimum Reporting Requirements”.
SGS based this opinion in the review of Citi’s internal documents and a sample of EP-covered financial
products and their respective EP checklists and Independent Reviews.
Citigroup Inc. reported information is aligned to the EP Reporting Criteria requirements as follows:
Public Reporting of the EP-covered financial products separately: Project Finance Advisory Services,
Project Finance Loans, Project-Related Corporate Loans, Bridge Loans and Project-Related Refinance
and Project-Related Acquisition Finance. There were only Project Finance Loans and PRCL in 2021.
The loans were categorized as A, B or C, dependent on the environmental and social risks posed.
Total number of Project Finance Loans and Project-Related Corporate Loans that reached Financial
Close during the reporting period ( 2021 )
The Project Finance Loans and Project-Related Corporate Loans were broken down by: Sector,
Region, Country Designation, and whether an whether an Independent Review has been carried out.
Independent review is required for A projects and, for B projects when needed. Both Project Finance
transactions were category B, and both had an Independent Review.
The EP transactions were over the threshold of:
o 10 million USD for Project Capital Cost required in the Equator Principles IV for project
finance loans, and
o Over 50 million USD for Project-Related Corporate Loans (total aggregate loan amount and
the EPFI’s individual commitment) in the Equator Principles IV
It was identified the transactions which their combined Scope 1 and Scope 2 Emissions are expected
to be more than 100,000 tonnes of CO 2 equivalent annually. In these cases, an annual GHG
emissions report and a climate change risk assessment is requested for the transaction.

Introduction

The publication of the Sustainability Accounting Standard (“Standard”) for the Investment Banking & Brokerage

Industry marks an important milestone for the industry and for global capital markets more generally. It is the first

Standard designed to assist companies in the Investment Banking industry in disclosing financially material, decision-

useful sustainability information to investors.

The Investment Banking Industry Standard was first released in a provisional form in June 2015 after an extensive

standard-setting process. Following the release of the Provisional Standard, the SASB staff, under the guidance of the

SASB standard-setting board (“the Standards Board” or “the SASB”), engaged in further due process to revise the

Standard. In October 2018, the Standards Board approved revisions to the Standard. The Standards Board

subsequently voted to approve the Investment Banking Industry Standard, thereby including it in as one of the 77

industries for which the SASB has developed and published an industry standard.

The Basis for Conclusions describes the rationale for revisions made to the provisional industry standard. Additionally,

the document outlines the standard-setting process the Standards Board used to codify the standard. All standard-

setting documentation, including prior drafts of the standard, summary reports, and comment letters, which informed

the development of the standard, are publicly available at the Standard Setting Archive of the SASB website.

The Standards Board

The Standards Board is charged with developing, issuing, and maintaining SASB standards. The Standards Board

operates in accordance with its primary governance documents, including the SASB’s Conceptual Framework and

Rules of Procedure. The Conceptual Framework sets out the basic concepts, principles, definitions, and objectives that

guide the Standards Board in its approach to setting standards. The Rules of Procedure establishes the due process

followed by the Standards Board and staff in their standard-setting activities. The standard-setting process is designed

to ensure each industry standard reflects the core objectives established in the Conceptual Framework to facilitate

companies’ cost-effective reporting of financially material and decision-useful sustainability information to investors.

In its standard-setting role, the Standards Board operates in a transparent manner, including holding public board

meetings. The Standards Board currently uses a sector-based committee structure, with three Standards Board

members assigned primary responsibility for each given sector. In addition to sector committee reviews, the full

Standards Board evaluates revisions to the standards. Information on Standards Board meetings, including minutes,

agendas, and a schedule of upcoming meetings is available on the SASB website. A list of Standards Board members

and their respective sector committee assignments is included in Appendix A.

Development of the Sustainability Accounting Standards

SASB staff initiated its standard-setting activities in 2012 under the oversight of the Standards Council.^1 From August

2012 to March 2016, the SASB staff developed provisional standards for each of the industries identified in the

Sustainable Industry Classification System® (SICS®).^2 The provisional standards were developed through an iterative

(^1) The Standards Council served in a process oversight role, distinct from the standard-setting role the Standards Board serves in. Upon
completion of the provisional phase in 2016, the Standards Council was disbanded.
(^2) At the time of the development of the provisional standards, SICS® contained 79 industries. SICS® was subsequently revised to 77
industries as a result of the combining of industries that contained similar sustainability-related risk and opportunity characteristics.

BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS | INVESTMENT BANKING & BROKERAGE INDUSTRY | 5

and transparent process centered on independent research, market input, and oversight from the Standards Council.

Each provisional industry standard was developed based on staff research, industry working group (“IWG”) feedback,

public comments, and individual consultations with companies, investors, and other relevant experts. Throughout the

development of the provisional standards, more than 2,800 individuals participated in IWGs, 172 public comment

letters were received, and hundreds of individual consultations were conducted with market participants by the SASB

staff.

In 2016, following the issuance of the provisional standards across all industries, the SASB staff initiated a dedicated

market consultation period to gain further insight into market views on the provisional standards. Subsequently, the

Standards Board was seated and initiated a due process phase that culminated in the codification of 77 industry

standards in October 2018. This standard-setting phase that began with the provisional standards and concluded with

the codified standards is described more fully below. All standard-setting documentation discussed below are publicly

available at the Standard Setting Archive of the SASB website.

 Consultation: In the six-month period from Q4 2016 – Q1 2017, the SASB staff conducted
consultations to gather additional input from companies, investors, and relevant experts on the
provisional standards. Throughout this phase, the SASB staff received input on the complete set of
industry standards from individual consultations conducted with 141 companies, 19 industry
associations, and 271 investor consultations via 38 institutional investors. The Consultation Summary
comprises the findings from the consultations.
 Technical Agenda: In July 2017, after a period of review to evaluate market input from consultations
on the provisional standards, the Standards Board worked with the SASB staff to publish the Technical
Agenda. The Technical Agenda formally lists the areas of focus to address in preparing the standards
for codification, emphasizing those issues for which strong evidence surfaced and/or those which
received significant market feedback during the consultation period.
 Public Comment Period: In October 2017, the Standards Board published exposure drafts of the
standards, which incorporated proposed changes guided by the Technical Agenda to the provisional
standards. This opened a 90-day period, subsequently extended to a 120-day period, from October
2017 to January 2018, for public comment and review of proposed changes to provisional standards.
Market participants provided 120 comment letters during the comment period. All letters received and
a Summary of Public Comments are available at the Standard Setting Archive.
The Standards Board and the SASB staff evaluated the public comments received in conjunction with previous market

input and research to determine the revisions to be made to the provisional standard.

Approval of the Industry Standard

On October 13, 2018, the Standards Board voted unanimously to revise the Provisional Standard for the Investment

Banking industry. In light of these revisions, on October 16, 2018, the Standards Board voted unanimously in favor of

removing this Standard’s provisional status. In doing so, the Standards Board considered all phases of the standard-

setting process, including those detailed in the above documents, to assess their underlying rationale, their adherence

to due process, and their faithfulness to the essential concepts of sustainability accounting, as described in the

Conceptual Framework.

BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS | INVESTMENT BANKING & BROKERAGE INDUSTRY | 6

The following section of this document describes the rationale for the revisions. Appendix B contains a redline table

that summarizes these revisions. Revisions relative to the provisional standard that have not altered the scope or

content of disclosure topics or metrics, such as those that are intended to improve the consistency, clarity, and

accuracy of the standard, are not specifically addressed in the Basis for Conclusions.

Future Updates to the Standards

As social, economic, regulatory, and other developments alter an industry’s competitive landscape, the SASB

standards may need to evolve to reflect new market dynamics. The Standards Board will follow a regular standards

review cycle to address emerging and evolving issues that may result in updates to the SASB standards.

The Standards Board intends to direct the SASB staff to compile and publish a Research Agenda , which outlines items

that have been identified as requiring further analysis. Evidence-based research and market input, including feedback

from outreach and consultation, will inform reviews of issues on the Research Agenda. Items from the Research

Agenda may later be added to the Standards Board’s Technical Agenda for additional due process and formal

deliberation. All updates are subject to the standard-setting process described in the Rules of Procedure.

BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS | INVESTMENT BANKING & BROKERAGE INDUSTRY | 7

Revision FN-IB:01 – Industry: Investment Banking &

Brokerage; Topic Name: Employee Inclusion

2017 Technical Agenda Item #2-15 Description

The SASB is evaluating the revision of metric FN0102-06^3 to ensure the alignment, decision-usefulness, and cost-

effectiveness of the metrics associated with the topic.

Summary of Change – Revise Metric and Revise Topic Name

The SASB revised provisional metric FN0102-06 from “Percentage of gender and racial/ethnic group representation

for: (1) executives and (2) all others” to “Percentage of gender and racial/ethnic group representation for (1) executive

management, (2) non-executive management, (3) professionals, and (4) all other employees.”

Note: For integrated banks, the guidance is to report employees of the investment banking segment. If the company is

also involved in asset/wealth management, where the same metric is included, disclosure should include reporting by

segment rather than aggregated at the corporate level.

Additionally, the SASB revised the topic name from Employee Inclusion to Employee Diversity & Inclusion to improve

its representativeness of the associated metric and measured performance.

Adherence to Criteria for Accounting Metrics

The Investment Banking & Brokerage Industry Provisional Standard included a topic, Employee Inclusion, with an

associated quantitative metric meant to measure how companies in the industry manage their human capital and

ensure attraction and retention of talent by hiring diverse candidates. Investment banking companies face a high

degree of competition for skilled employees, and the ability of companies to attract and retain them is likely to

become increasingly material. By ensuring gender and racial diversity throughout the organization, companies are

likely to expand their candidate pool. Further, evidence suggests that diverse groups of employees at investment

banking and brokerage companies may reduce risk.

The provisional metric FN0102-06 provided a breakdown of gender/racial diversity at only two general levels:

executives and non-executives. The SASB revised the metric to include a more decision-useful breakdown of employee

categories. Specifically, the revised metric includes (1) executive management, (2) non-executive management, (3)

professionals, and (4) all other employee categories. For the U.S. workforce, these four categories directly match to

the (1) Executives/Senior Officials and Managers, (2) First/Mid Officials and Managers, (3) Professionals, and (4) All

Other Employees categories from the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s (EEOC’s) EEO-1 Job

Classification Guide. Although the provisional metric provided a picture of the company’s overall workforce diversity,

it failed to separate employees into categories where diversity may be a driver of corporate value, i.e., decision

makers. As highlighted by companies and investors and supported by the evidence discussed below, diversity among

employees involved in decision-making processes (e.g., portfolio managers, investment analysts, and traders) at

financial institutions may improve the risk-return profile of organizations. Employees occupying such positions would

generally be classified in the three of the referenced EEOC categories. Therefore, the revised breakdown provides

more decision-useful information.

(^3) FN0102-06 – Percentage of gender and racial/ethnic group representation for: (1) executives and (2) all others

BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS | INVESTMENT BANKING & BROKERAGE INDUSTRY | 8

The revised metric references the U.S. EEOC’s EEO-1 Job Classification Guide, which enhances the alignment of the

metric with standard practice, as well as the comparability and verifiability of the reported data. As supported by

market feedback, the revision also improves the fair representation, usefulness, and completeness of information

disclosed in line with the metric, as the revised breakdown reveals additional relevant information that is decision-

useful in assessing companies’ performance on the disclosure topic.

Further, the SASB updated the technical protocol of the metric to allow banks to report gender representation by

country and/or region outside of the U.S. The provisional version of the technical protocol requires gender diversity

data to be reported for global operations in a single table, in which employees from all geographic regions would be

aggregated. As workforce diversity can vary significantly by geographic region, and due to differing regulation, legal

risk, or reputational risks associated with workforce diversity depending on region, a geographic breakdown of

performance would provide more representative, useful, and comparable data for investors. As such, it would be

appropriate to provide diversity disclosure at a country or regional level to prevent potentially unrepresentative

datasets that are largely driven by company geographic exposure rather than workforce diversity within a given

geographic area.

Therefore, the SASB included the following note: “Where relevant, the entity may provide supplemental breakdown

of racial/ethnic group and/or gender representation by country or region.” The revision improves fair representation

and neutrality criteria of the metric by allowing the additional disclosure of such data for jurisdictions in which such

data would be a useful and relevant data point to understand company exposure to and management of risks and

opportunities related to the topic

Lastly, the SASB provided clarification that the U.S. EEOC’s EEO-1 Job Classification Guide shall be used for classifying

employees into four occupational categories only for the U.S. workforce. The SASB stated in the technical protocol

that non-U.S. workforce companies shall use occupational classifications systems adopted in countries where the

workforce is employed. Companies will further categorize non-U.S. employees into four occupational categories

equivalent to the EEO-1 categories using their best judgement by linking equivalent occupation categories from

occupational classification systems adopted in countries where non-U.S. workforce is employed. The revision therefore

enhances applicability of the technical guidance associated with the metric to companies with a globally diversified

workforce.

Supporting Analysis

Research suggests that diversity may be of particular importance within individual departments of investment banks,

such as trading desks, research teams, and sales, where diverse groups show better performance on metrics such as

return on investment, risk, and client attraction and retention. Diversity within those groups of employees, as shown

by evidence, can have a material impact on an investment bank. For example, one study shows that men are 2.5 times

more likely to break rules, which can lead to excessive risk taking and losses to the firm.^4

The provisional metric may obscure diversity levels within specific employee categories by grouping them together

across the organization, as highlighted by market feedback (see Market Input).

BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS | INVESTMENT BANKING & BROKERAGE INDUSTRY | 9

Analysis of corporate disclosure suggests that large financial institutions, including diversified banks with investment

banking operations, report diversity metrics referencing categories defined by the EEOC. Some of the largest

companies in the industry, including four of the ten largest investment banks, provide disclosure using the EEOC

categories referenced in the revision.

There are several challenges related to reporting racial/ethnic data outside of the U.S. First, classification categories

vary significantly country-by-country and region-by-region. Therefore, it would not be practical or necessarily

representative of racial/ethnic diversity for companies to aggregate their global number of employees by EEO-1

categories. Second, data are typically only available in some countries (e.g., Canada and Brazil) due to privacy laws

preventing disclosure. Finally, some countries also look at age, disability, gender identity, sexual orientation, or other

aspects of diversity, but these categories may be defined differently by each country.

The updated metric addresses these concerns by requiri ng gender breakdown globally but racial/ethnic breakdown

per the EEO-1 categories only for the U.S. workforce. Companies shall describe their policies for promoting inclusivity

and preventing the development of a homogenous workforce outside the U.S. that is not representative of the local

populations. They can also disclose racial/ethnic or other breakdowns by region or country-specific categories, if they

choose. This update recognizes that a perfectly representative workforce would mirror population demographics, but

that regional demographics and ideal representation may vary widely. Thus, it improves the representativeness and the

usefulness of the metric.

Lastly, the SASB revised the topic name from Employee Inclusion to Employee Diversity & Inclusion. The majority of

companies (including all of the largest publicly listed companies) in the industry refer to the sustainability human

capital issue covered by the disclosure topic as “diversity and inclusion” in their filings and/or websites. Financial

services companies develop policies and strategies around “diversity and inclusion” that are referenced in their

sustainability reports or other corporate communications and reporting documents. In the context of their diversity

and inclusion discussion, some companies report quant itative metrics, including those measuring gender and

racial/ethnic representation of their employees. Such quantitative metrics are essentially the measure of diversity as

well as inclusion, when provided by occupation category, rather than a measure of inclusion only. As the SASB metric

provides investors with information relevant to measuring both diversity and inclusion, the SASB revised the disclosure

topic name to more accurately reflect the intent of the topic and the underlying metric.

Market Input

Investors: Investors and companies across sectors, including analysts covering investment banks and asset managers,

consistently communicated that while a gender breakdown is relevant globally, a racial/ethnic group breakdown by

EEO-1 categories is feasible only in the United States. In addition, some stated that the provisional metric is overly

U.S.-centric and would not provide meaningful information for large multinational companies that operate in different

countries.

Companies: Several banks and asset management companies noted that aggregating diversity across an organization

may hinder its comparability, as companies reporting the data at the enterprise level while having a large retail

banking presence would likely appear more diverse. The vast majority of banks and asset management companies, as

well as companies across sectors, consistently communicated that while a gender breakdown is relevant globally, a

racial/ethnic group breakdown by EEO-1 categories is feasible only in the United States. In addition, some stated that

BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS | INVESTMENT BANKING & BROKERAGE INDUSTRY | 10

the provisional metric is overly U.S.-centric and would not provide meaningful information for large multinational

companies that operate in different countries.

One company expressed concerns regarding limitations for tracking employee data globally, as required by the

provisional metric. The company points out that depending on a geographic breakdown of operations, comparability

of the reported data may be negated due to its skewness, i.e., based on the percentage of total employees for whom

gender and racial data is available as well as based on difference of exposure to countries with differing levels of

diversity in the population and/or workforce.

Benefits

Improves decision-usefulness: Additional breakdown by EEOC categories, as well as reporting by segment improves

fair representation, usefulness, and completeness of the revised metric, and therefore provides more relevant

information about performance and improves comparability across companies that may have different exposures to

various segments.

Improves cost-effectiveness: As stated by companies, the revised metric is aligned with the framework used by human

resources departments and thus improves the alignment, comparability, and verifiability criteria of the metric, which

makes it cost-effective to collect and report. By limiting the required quantitative disclosure on race/ethnicity to U.S.

operations, the revision further improves cost-effectiveness.

Improves the SASB Standard: This change improves cost-effectiveness by limiting the required quantitative disclosure

on race/ethnicity to U.S. operations, which is measurable and complete. It also improves decision-usefulness by only

requiring the aggregation of gender data, which is more likely to be comparable across companies in different

industries and geographies.

Revision FN-IB:02 – Industry: Investment Banking &

Brokerage; Topic Name: Integration of Environmental,

Social, and Governance Risk Factors in Advisory,

Underwriting, and Brokerage Activities

2017 Technical Agenda Item #2-22 Description

The SASB is evaluating the suitability of the topic name.

Summary of Change – Revise Topic Name

The SASB revised the provisional topic name Integration of Environmental, Social, and Governance Risk Factors in

Advisory, Underwriting, and Brokerage Activities to Incorporation of Environmental, Social, and Governance Factors in

Investment Banking & Brokerage Activities.

Supporting Rationale

Several stakeholders highlighted that it is beneficial to streamline the topic name to make it encompass all investment

banking and brokerage activities.

The revised name is inclusive of all investment banking and brokerage activities. The SASB added an additional metric

focused on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) integration in proprietary investing and lending (which was

not addressed in the provisional name). Please refer to Revision FN-IB:04.

The SASB also removed the term “Risk” from the title, as ESG factors may present both risks and opportunities related

to investment banking and brokerage activities. The re vision improves neutrality of the disclosure topic.

Lastly, the SASB replaced the term “integration” with term “incorporation” to improve alignment with the industry

terminology. The Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) defines incorporation of ESG factors broadly, where

“integration of ESG issues” is one of the four ways it can be done in practice. The other ways of ESG incorporation

include screening, sustainability themed investment, or a combination of all three ways. As the scope of the disclosure

topic and associated metrics intends to capture a variety of approaches and strategies to ESG incorporation, the

change improves the appropriateness of the name.

Benefits

Improves the SASB standard: The revision improves the completeness, neutrality, and fair representation of the

disclosure topic name.

2017 Technical Agenda Item #2-23 Description

The SASB is evaluating the revision of metrics FN0102-16^5 and FN0102-17^6 to ensure the relevance, decision-

usefulness, and cost-effectiveness of the metrics associated with the topic.

Summary of Change – Revise Metrics

The SASB removed the following provisional metrics:

 FN0102-16 – Amount of sustainability-focused services , activities, and products, broken down by: (1)
origination, (2) market making, and (3) advisory and underwriting
 FN0102-17 – Deal size of advisory and underwriting transactions for companies in the following
sectors/industries: Energy/Oil & Gas, Materials/Basic Materials, Industrials, and Utilities
The SASB added the following new metric:

 FN-IB-410a.1 – Revenue from (1) underwriting, (2) advisory, and (3) securitization transactions
incorporating integration of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors, by industry
Adherence to Criteria for Accounting Metrics

The Investment Banking & Brokerage Industry Provisional Standard included a topic, Integration of Environmental,

Social, and Governance Risk Factors in Advisory, Underwriting, and Brokerage Activities^7 , with three associated metrics

to describe how and the extent to which investment ba nks manage their exposure to ESG risks and opportunities

through key business activities. The provisional metrics called for a description of the company’s approach to ESG

integration as well as for additional quantitative data. Specifically, provisional metric FN0102-16 called for the

disclosure of the company’s portfolio of ESG products in advisory and underwriting, origination, and market making.

Meanwhile, provisional metric FN0102-17 asked for the company to provide data on its exposure to carbon-intensive

industries.

The SASB addressed the concepts captured in both quantitative provisional metrics (exposure within a range of

investment banking activities and industry-specific ESG risks) with a single new metric. With respect to provisional

metric FN0102-16, replacing the terminology “sustainability-focused services, activities, and products” with a measure

of products and services “incorporating integration of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors” is likely to

(^5) FN0102-16 – Amount of sustainability-focused services, activities, and products, broken down by: (1) origination, (2) market making, and

BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS | INVESTMENT BANKING & BROKERAGE INDUSTRY | 13

remove subjectivity. For example, market feedback suggests that the labeling of a product or service as “sustainability-

focused” may not be consistently applied by companies, therefore limiting its comparability. Moreover, the provisional

metric, as written, failed to ensure the fair representation of the aspect of the topic it is intended to measure.

Specifically, in addition to being subjective, “sustainability-focused” products and services constituted only a subset of

products and services provided by investment banks that incorporate ESG factors. This is because investment banks

often consider ESG factors in their advisory, underwriting, and origination activities, even when those services may not

necessarily be labeled as ESG- or sustainability-focused. Finally, as investors increasingly encourage material ESG

factors to be holistically integrated into traditional business activities, measuring ESG-focused products and services in

isolation may have contradicted that objective by incentivizing companies to view ESG as an add-on to traditional

business activities rather than an integral part of them.

With respect to provisional metric FN0102-17, the SASB removed the focus on carbon exposure from the metrics and

instead incorporating a general breakdown of exposure by industry. ESG risks and opportunities are present in all

industries in the economy and the SASB does not make a judgment as to which issues are more or less important than

others. Therefore, the revised metric includes a breakdown of exposure through key business activities by industry,

improving the neutrality of the metric. Investment banks provide underwriting, advisory, and securitization services to

clients in various industries of the economy. Considering the ESG factors to which their clients are exposed—or failing

to do so—may have material impacts on investment banks. Such impacts may be both direct, through the risk profile

of the client, and reputational. Therefore, from a bank’s perspective, it is extremely important to understand and

consider the whole universe of ESG risks and opportunities to which its clients are exposed, rather than only those

applicable to carbon-intensive industries.

Therefore, in expanding the scope of disclosure to include ESG integration that banks may incorporate outside of their

“sustainability-focused” products or services as well as across the entire economy, the revision improves the

completeness, fair representation, and neutrality of the metrics associated with this topic, as defined by the SASB

Conceptual Framework.

Supporting Analysis

A review of ESG disclosure from investment banks suggests that companies report quantitative and qualitative data

inconsistently. One of the most consistently reported ESG metrics is the amount of green bond underwriting.

Nevertheless, analysts pointed out that even when the amount of green bond underwriting is disclosed by peers, the

data is unlikely to be comparable, as some companies report the value of the syndicate underwriting while others only

disclose the amount for which they were accountable. Further, the scope of projects/products that companies include

in the disclosure differs significantly. Companies also fail to provide clear definitions of certain ESG integration efforts

or product offerings. Feedback from companies echoed these findings and confirmed that a consistent definition of

ESG integration is needed. Aligning the format of disclosure per investment banking activity improves comparability of

the metric. Further, a holistic approach to integration of ESG factors rather than a focus on specific risks improves

completeness and neutrality of the metric.

Several large investment banks, including 2 of the 10 largest by market capitalization, mention in their sustainability

reports that they perform Environmental and Social Risk Management (ESRM) reviews of their transactions and

investments. For example, a large investment bank states, “In 2015, 782 deals across 12 industries and three regions

(Americas, EMEA, and Asia Pacific) were referred for environmental and social due diligence.” A significant share of

these deals may not necessarily fall under the definition of “sustainability-focused,” which supports the revision to the

BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS | INVESTMENT BANKING & BROKERAGE INDUSTRY | 14

metric to cover those that incorporate integration of ESG. Moreover, several large investment banks disclose exposure

to a broad set of industries rather than focusing on carbon-intensive ones. This highlights the fact that, in addition to

the revised SASB metric providing a more holistic view on exposure to ESG risks and opportunities, it is also in line

with industry practice.

Companies in the industry report total revenue from each of the segments, including (1) underwriting, (2) advisory,

and (3) securitization, on their income statement. Although breakdown and segment naming may not be consistent

across all companies, generally, the revenue data is publicly available information. Additionally, several data providers,

including Bloomberg, release League Tables which include information on the volume and number of transactions as

well as company market share in each of the segments.^8 Considering the current state of disclosure by companies in

the industry, the structure of the new SASB metric is likely to ensure the cost-effectiveness of reporting. As discussed

in the Market Input section, such a metric enhances comparability of disclosure around ESG incorporation, which is

desired by companies, and the decision-usefulness of information for investors.

Market Input

Investors: Investors generally recommended that the revised metrics for this topic reflected a more holistic approach to

ESG integration rather than focusing on specific risks (e.g., climate). All the analysts that provided feedback on the

revised metric found the revision very helpful and would like to see companies report their exposure to products such

as green bonds in a standardized manner. Along with the qualitative discussion of ESG risks and the strategies

companies employ to account for those risks when providing investment banking services (FN0102-15), this additional

quantitative metric provides users with a holistic view of a bank’s ESG exposure.

Companies: Large U.S.-listed, integrated banks provided extensive feedback on this topic. Companies stated that

while most of them report on their ESG integration strategies, such reporting is not consistent and not comparable

across the industry. All companies saw the benefit in standardizing disclosure by providing common categories of

reporting. The feedback confirmed that the focus should be on holistic integration of ESG factors rather than on

highlighting exposure to a few carbon-intensive industries, as individual companies may be integrating ESG factors

differently and have different levels of exposure due to their business decisions.

Other: The SASB received feedback from a subject matter expert that exposure to ESG risks is better assessed when

measured in U.S. dollars of revenue rather than in the number of transactions, total dollar value of transactions, or

other units of measurement. According to the stakeholder, higher fees are charged for transactions involving sectors

and industries that are perceived as “riskier” from an ESG standpoint, such as the Oil & Gas industry, Utilities, and

others. These fees directly contribute to higher revenues. For that reason, smaller number and total value of

transactions involving such sectors and industries may not fairly represent banks’ level of financial exposure through

the income generated from such transactions. Thus, revenue is a more representative measurement of exposure to

topic-level risks.

Benefits

Improves the SASB Standard: The revision improves the completeness of the metrics associated with the topic, as it

shifts the focus from only a small subset of ESG risks and opportunities to investment banks to a more holistic

approach for analyzing integration of ESG factors in the portfolio of services. The revision also improves the fair

representation and neutrality of the metrics.

Improves decision-usefulness: As highlighted by the feedback received from investors, the overall industry-level

exposure through the portfolio of investment banking services provides decision-useful information and allows for a

more holistic analysis.

Revision FN-IB:04 – Industry: Investment Banking &

Brokerage; Topic Name: Integration of Environmental,

Social, and Governance Risk Factors in Advisory,

Underwriting, and Brokerage Activities

2017 Technical Agenda Item #2-24 Description

The SASB is evaluating the addition of a metric to ensure the relevance and decision-usefulness of the metrics

associated with the topic.

Summary of Change – Add Metric

The SASB added the following metric:

 FN-IB-410a.2 – (1) Number and (2) total value of investments and loans incorporating integration of
environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors, by industry.
Adherence to Criteria for Accounting Metrics

The Investment Banking & Brokerage Industry Provisional Standard included a topic, Integration of Environmental,

Social, and Governance Risk Factors in Advisory, Underwriting, and Brokerage Activities^9 , with associated metrics to

describe how and the extent to which investment banks manage their exposure to ESG risks and opportunities

through key business activities. The provisional metrics called for a description of the company’s approach to ESG

integration as well as for additional quantitative data around the portfolio ESG products in underwriting, origination,

and market making.

The revision adds a metric to capture the bank’s level of integration of ESG factors in the investing and lending

business segment. As highlighted by research and feedback from companies and investors, investing and lending are

among the key business activities of investment banks; however, such activities are not addressed in the Provisional

Standard. Companies in the industry may be exposed to ESG risks and opportunities when they provide proprietary

investments and loans to various projects. Therefore, the inclusion of the new metric improves the completeness and

usefulness of reported information, enabling investors to better assess the company’s performance on the disclosure

topic.

Supporting Analysis

Analysis of corporate disclosure suggests that proprietary investing and lending are some of the primary activities of

investment banks in which integration of ESG factors is currently occurring and where related financial impacts are

most prominent. In their corporate filings, some of the largest investment banks by market cap discuss their

integration of ESG factors into investing and lending activities. For example, a review of disclosure by the top 10

investment banks shows that several of the largest companies provide quantitative disclosure on the amount they

have invested in sustainability-focused projects, such as those related to renewable energy, water efficiency,

sustainable infrastructure and transportation, and others. Most companies disclose these activities in their corporate

(^9) See Revision FN-IB:02 which discusses the provisional topic name change from Integration of Environmental, Social, and Governance Risk
Factors in Advisory, Underwriting, and Brokerage Activities to Incorporation of Environmental, Social, and Governance Factors in
Investment Banking & Brokerage Activities.

BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS | INVESTMENT BANKING & BROKERAGE INDUSTRY | 17

social responsibility (CSR) reports, while several banks also include disclosure in their Form 10-K or 20-F filings. This

evidence highlights that the investing and lending is one of the key business activities of investment banks though

which exposure to ESG risks and opportunities may materially impact corporate performance. Therefore, addressing

this business segment with a stand-alone metric improves the completeness of the accounting metrics associated with

the disclosure topic. As a result, the revision improves decision-usefulness of the information reported on the topic by

providing a more holistic view of the quality of management.

Market Input

Investors: Investors suggested that this segment should be addressed in the Investment Banking & Brokerage industry

and indicated that the ESG integration topic is particularly relevant to investing and lending activities.

Companies: A number of companies raised the point that investing and lending activities did not seem to be

adequately addressed in the disclosure topic, and that current disclosure from companies lacks comparability.

Companies stated that a metric focused on ESG integration through the investing and lending segment should be

included to supplement the existing metrics associated with the topic. Companies also stated that they already collect

and report data on such activities, specifically addressing ESG-focused products and services, so they thought that the

added metric would be cost-effective to report.

Benefits

Improves the SASB Standard: The added metric is likely to provide information that would be material to companies

and decision-useful to investors in analyzing investment banks’ integration of ESG factors holistically. The revision

enhances the completeness and usefulness of the data reported to investors.

BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS | INVESTMENT BANKING & BROKERAGE INDUSTRY | 18

Revision FN-IB:05 – Industry: Investment Banking &

Brokerage; Topic Name: Integration of Environmental,

Social, and Governance Risk Factors in Advisory,

Underwriting, and Brokerage Activities

Summary of Change – Revise Metric

The SASB revised metric FN0102-15 from “Discussion of how environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors are

incorporated into core products and services" to "Description of approach to incorporation of environmental, social,

and governance (ESG) factors in investment banking and brokerage activities."

Adherence to Criteria for Accounting Metrics

The Investment Banking & Brokerage Industry Provisional Standard included a topic, Integration of Environmental,

Social, and Governance Risk Factors in Advisory, Underwriting, and Brokerage Activities, with associated metrics that

described how and the extent to which investment bank s managed their exposure to ESG risks and opportunities

through key business activities. The provisional metrics called for a description of the company’s approach to ESG

integration as well as for additional quantitative data around the portfolio ESG products in underwriting, origination,

and market making. The provisional metric FN0102-15 was intended to provide discussion and analysis of companies’

strategy and process of incorporation of ESG factors in key products and services provided by investment banks.

While the metric may have provided investors with relevant, useful information related to the topic, the revision better

aligns the metric with existing industry approaches to the integration of ESG factors into company operations.

Specifically, the SASB updated the metric to address feedback from multiple stakeholders suggesting that the SASB

seek to align its approach to disclosures related to the level of ESG incorporation by companies with existing

frameworks and standards such as the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) and the Task Force on Climate-

related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The revision to the metric and associated technical protocol therefore enhances

the comparability, completeness, verifiability, and alignment criteria specified in the SASB Conceptual Framework.

Supporting Analysis

The revised format of the technical protocol enhances alignment of the standard with relevant applicable external

frameworks as it builds off the structure provided by the PRI Framework around companies' approach to incorporation

of ESG factors in investment and wealth management processes. In the case of the Investment Banking & Brokerage

industry specifically, incorporation of ESG factors in underwriting, advisory, securitization, and investing and lending

can be viewed similarly to analysis of investments by asset managers. The PRI is a widely recognized framework with

approximately 1,800 signatories representing almost $70 trillion of assets under management (AUM)^10. Therefore,

alignment of the SASB discussion with this widely-adopted framework is likely to improve cost-effectiveness.

Furthermore, alignment of the scope of disclosure and definitions (i.e., “incorporation of ESG factors” and examples

of ESG factors/issues) to the PRI enhances the comparability of the standard by providing additional, specific guidance

to companies regarding elements of the disclosure they shall include related to their incorporation of ESG factors.

(^10) “About the PRI,” Principles for Responsible Investment, accessed May 9, 2018, https://www.unpri.org/pri.

BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS | INVESTMENT BANKING & BROKERAGE INDUSTRY | 19

Finally, the completeness of disclosures associated with the metric is enhanced by providing additional guidance

regarding the scope of the technical protocol. Specifically, the revision to the technical protocol includes a discussion

of: (a) high-level approach, including policies set in place; (b) operational processes and procedures, including staff

involved, approach to implementation and oversight, and assessment and review processes; and (c) technical aspects

of ESG incorporation such as scenario analysis and impact of ESG issues on analysts’ views on traditional fundamental

factors. These revisions enhance the scope of the metric by including strategic and operational elements of ESG

incorporation in addition to technical aspects, which was primarily the area covered by the original version of the

metric. Furthermore, to address feedback from a subject matter expert, the SASB structured discussion of ESG

incorporation around clearly defined business activities of companies in the industry: (a) underwriting, (b) advisory, (c)

securitization, (d) investing and lending, and (e) securities services. Because the revised approach provides a more

complete picture of company performance while remaining aligned with existing, widely used frameworks, the

revision is likely to improve both the cost-effectiveness and decision-usefulness of disclosure generated by the metric.

Market Input

Companies: Companies strongly advocated for the alignment of the metrics with existent frameworks, specifically, the

TCFD as it pertained to the Investment Banking & Brokerage industry, and the PRI and TCFD as they pertained to the

Asset Management & Custody Activities industry. Companies stated that with emergence of several ESG frameworks

in the recent years, compliance and reporting of ESG data is likely to become costly. Therefore, ensuring alignment

across such frameworks was highly advocated by companies in the industry to ensure cost-effectiveness of disclosure.

Benefits

Improves decision-usefulness: The revision provides greater specificity regarding company efforts to integrate ESG

factors and thereby enhances the scope of disclosure by providing more complete, comparable, and therefore,

decision-useful disclosures to investors in assessing the quality of ESG incorporation in core investment banking and

brokerage activities.

Improves cost-effectiveness: The revision improves the cost-effectiveness of the standard by aligning the guidance

provided in the technical protocol with that of the PRI and the TCFD.

Regulatory Environment

2017 Technical Agenda Item #2-16 Description

The SASB is evaluating the revision of metric FN0102-07^11 to ensure the relevance and decision-usefulness of the

metrics associated with the topic.

Summary of Change – Add Metric and Revise Metric

The SASB split metric:

 FN0102-07 – Amount of legal and regulatory fines and settlements associated with financial industry
regulation and percentage that resulted from whistleblowing actions
into its quantitative and qualitative components:

 FN-IB-510a.1 – Total amount of monetary losses as a result of legal proceedings associated with fraud,
insider trading, anti-trust, anti-competitive behavior, market manipulation, malpractice, or other related
financial industry laws or regulations
with a new metric subsequently created to capture whistleblower policies:

 FN-IB-510a.2 – Description of whistleblower policies and procedures
Adherence to Criteria for Accounting Metrics

The Investment Banking & Brokerage Industry Provisional Standard included a topic for Management of the Legal &

Regulatory Environment^12 with associated metrics that focused on a company’s management of risks related to the

legal and regulatory environment. Specifically, the topic and two associated quantitative metrics provided information

to help analysts assess a company’s internal control policies to prevent tax evasion, fraud, money laundering, and

corruption. The provisional metric FN0102-07 measured the amount of legal and regulatory fines and settlements that

resulted from whistleblowing actions. The provisional metric was unlikely to provide a fair representation and

complete view of the topic and a company’s efforts and abilities to institute a successful whistleblower program,

limiting its decision-usefulness. The revision of the existing metric eliminates the need to disclose the percentage of

fines and settlements stemming from whistleblowers. To more adequately capture the nature of a company’s

whistleblower program, the SASB added a qualitative metric that facilitates disclosure of the unique characteristics of

a company’s whistleblower policies and practices in a more holistic manner. Combined, the two metrics fairly

represent the topic and improve the completeness of the standard.

(^12) See Revision FN-IB:09 which discusses the provisional topic name change from “Management of the Legal & Regulatory Environment” to
“Business Ethics.”

BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS | INVESTMENT BANKING & BROKERAGE INDUSTRY | 21

Supporting Analysis

The provisional metric did not provide a complete picture of a company’s whistleblower program, which reduces the

decision-usefulness of the resulting disclosure. The SASB received feedback noting that reporting on the issue

generally includes the amount of fines and settlements related to violations of financial industry regulations plus a

stand-alone discussion of whistleblower policies. This was confirmed by an analysis of current disclosure practices in

SEC filings. As a set, the pair of revised metrics are more useful in measuring a company’s performance on the topic

because they provide a mix of quantitative and qualitative information, which is a characteristic that the provisional

metric lacked. Reporting on the share of fines resulting from whistleblower action does not necessarily highlight the

quality of a company’s whistleblower policies. For example, a report from Harvard Law notes “a high volume of calls

to a company’s hotline (as compared to peers and its i ndustry) may indicate that the company is experiencing

significant compliance issues and potentially has an ineffective compliance and ethics program. Conversely, a high

volume of hotline calls may suggest that the hotline is working as planned, that the company’s compliance and ethics

employee training program is effective, that there is greater awareness of the hotline, and increased trust in the

company’s compliance department.”^13 The split of the metrics consequently improves completeness by allowing

investors to better understand the extent to which the volume of whistleblowing-related fines may be influenced by

the company’s policies regarding whistleblowing. The split improves the SASB criteria for fair representation and

usefulness by clarifying the links between whistleblowing policies and related fines.

Market Input

Investors & others: A limited number of investors provided feedback on the revision. Those who did, unanimously

stated that the breakdown of regulatory fines and settlements resulting from whistleblowing actions is unlikely to

yield additional decision-useful information, and is therefore unnecessary. Alternatively, these analysts and one subject

matter expert recommended including a discussion of a company’s whistleblower policies, because combined with

other added or revised metrics associated with the topic, it provides a holistic view of the company’s performance.

Based on feedback from analysts, the share of fines resulting from whistleblower action does not necessarily highlight

the quality of a company’s whistleblower policies.

Companies: Five of the largest companies in the industry by market capitalization also suggested changing the metric

and including a qualitative discussion on a company’s whistleblower policies and procedures.

Benefits

Improves decision-usefulness: Splitting the provisional metric into two different metrics improves the decision-

usefulness of disclosure by providing a mix of quantitative and qualitative information. The quantitative metric on fines

and settlements provides an indication of past performance on the topic, while a stand-alone qualitative discussion of

whistleblower policies and practices captures information on a company’s unique whistleblower programs. In tandem,

and compared to the previous need to report on the percentage of fines and settlements resulting from

whistleblowing actions, both metrics fairly represent performance on the topic.

The SASB is evaluating the revision of metric FN0102-08^14 to ensure the relevance and decision-usefulness of the

metrics associated with the topic.

Summary of Change – Remove Metric

The SASB removed provisional metric FN0102-08, “Number of inquiries, complaints, or issues received by the legal

and compliance office through an internal monitoring or reporting system, and percentage that were substantiated.”

Adherence to Criteria for Accounting Metrics

The Investment Banking & Brokerage Industry Provisional Standard included a topic, Management of the Legal &

Regulatory Environment^15 , that was focused on a company’s management of risks related to the investment banking

industry’s legal and regulatory environment. Specifically, the topic and associated metrics provided information to help

analysts assess a company’s internal control policies to prevent tax evasion, fraud, money laundering, and corruption.

The two other metrics included in the topic covered disclosure of the amount of legal and regulatory fines incurred

that are associated with industry regulation and a description of the company’s policies and procedures regarding

internal whistleblowing. The provisional metric FN0102-08 measured the number of inquiries, complaints, or issues

received by the legal and compliance office through an internal monitoring or reporting system, and the percentage

that were substantiated. This metric was meant to be an indicator of the effectiveness of a company’s internal

compliance controls and a forward-looking proxy for potential violations and subsequent fines and penalties. The

provisional metric lacked comparability if reported, as companies have different types of policies and procedures of

internal controls, and therefore, the number of inquiries could range significantly and not be indicative of actual

performance on the topic. The removal of the metric therefore retains the decision-usefulness of the disclosures

contained in the remaining metrics (please refer to Revision FN-IB:06) on the topic, while reducing the cost burden of

reporting and avoiding potential issues in terms of comparability.

Supporting Analysis

The SASB analysis of disclosures from all U.S.-listed public companies has not revealed instances where a company

disclosed the number of inquiries, complaints, or issues received by the legal and compliance offices. Additionally, in

conversations with companies and investors, the SASB was not able to obtain evidence supporting the usefulness of

the provisional metric in assessing performance on the disclosure topic.

Market Input

Investors: Several investors stated that the metric would be challenging to interpret in a decision-useful manner.

BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS | INVESTMENT BANKING & BROKERAGE INDUSTRY | 23

Companies: The three large companies who provided comments on the disclosure topic unanimously expressed

concerns with metric FN0102-08. Companies stated that it would not be cost-effective to obtain information

comparable across companies due to the fact that individual companies may have differences in their internal

compliance processes.

Benefits

Improves the SASB Standard: Removal of the metric improves comparability of the remaining set of disclosures. Given

that each company has different approaches to internal controls and reporting issues to internal compliance

departments, removal of the metric prevents disclosure comparability concerns among companies.

Improves cost-effectiveness: The revised metric is more cost-effective and limits concerns related to standardization.

Brokerage; Topic Name: Management of the Legal &

Regulatory Environment

2017 Technical Agenda Item #2-18 Description

The SASB is evaluating the removal of metric FN0102-09^16 to ensure the relevance and cost-effectiveness of the

metrics associated with the topic.

Summary of Change – Remove Metric

The SASB removed provisional metric FN0102-09, “Number of conflicts of interest disclosed to clients, customers,

and/or counterparties.”

Adherence to Criteria for Accounting Metrics

The Investment Banking & Brokerage Industry Provisional Standard included a topic, Management of the Legal &

Regulatory Environment^17 , that was focused on a company’s management of risks related to the complex and, at

times, inconsistent set of national and international rules that may apply to industry activities. Specifically, the topic

and associated metrics provided information to help analysts assess a company’s internal control policies to prevent

tax evasion, fraud, money laundering, conflicted advice, and corruption. Other metrics associated with the topic

included disclosure of the amount of legal and regulatory fines incurred that are associated with industry regulation

and a description of the company’s policies and procedures regarding internal whistleblowing. The provisional metric

FN0102-09 measured the number of conflicts of interest involving the company and/or its representatives that are

disclosed to clients, customers, and/or counterparties. This metric was intended to be an indicator of a company’s

transparency regarding potentially conflicted advice that could be given to its customers and that could violate

industry ethical standards and/or result in regulatory scrutiny. However, the provisional metric was insufficient, as it

only captured a small and potentially not relevant aspect of a company’s approach to the professional integrity of

services provided, which represents a related but fundamentally unique offshoot of the broader topic of a company’s

management of the legal and regulatory environment. Further, as supported by the SASB analysis, the provisional

metric was not discussed by companies either directly or conceptually, which may be indicative of the lack of

relevance and fair representation of performance. The removal of the metric– along with the addition of a separate

topic, Professional Integrity (please refer to Revision FN-IB:10), which includes a different set of metrics –improves the

fair representation of disclosure related to this topic.

Supporting Analysis

An analysis of disclosures from listed companies in the industry revealed no cases of companies discussing the

concepts addressed in the metric (instances of conflict of interest disclosed to clients). The concept of conflict of

interest is strictly regulated in the financial services sector overall, and traditionally is discussed in the context of

fiduciary duty and policies around providing transparent information and fair advice to clients. To improve the fair

representation and relevance of the approach addressing conflicts of interest in the Investment Banking & Brokerage

industry, the SASB also added a stand-alone Professional Integrity topic (refer to Revision FN-IB:10) with associated

(^16) FN0102-09 – Number of conflicts of interest disclose d to clients, customers, and/or counterparties
(^17) See Revision FN-IB:09 which discusses the provisional topic name change from Management of the Legal & Regulatory Environment to

BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS | INVESTMENT BANKING & BROKERAGE INDUSTRY | 25

metrics, which would address fiduciary duty to clients and conflicts of interest. The inclusion of the topic of

Professional Integrity and associated metrics ensures completeness of information provided to investors and,

therefore, limits the relevance of metric FN0102-09. Consequently, the removal of the metric (along with the revision

associated with Revision FN-IB:10) would improve the fair representation and relevance of the sets of metrics included

in both the Management of the Legal & Regulatory Environment and Professional Integrity topics.

Market Input

Investors: Multiple investors consistently found the inclusion of the Professional Integrity topic with the associated

metrics addressing fiduciary duty and potential conflict of interest appropriate. The alignment of existing reporting

with this revision suggests that it improves the deci sion-usefulness of disclosure in the SASB standard.

Companies: Several large investment banks that provided feedback on the metric removal stated that adding a stand-

alone Professional Integrity topic which covered conflicts of interest is a relevant approach to measuring performance

of companies in the industry.

Benefits

Improves the SASB Standard: The removal of the provisi onal metric and the development of a separate topic that

addresses conflict of interest improves relevance and fair representation of accounting metrics included in each

disclosure topic. Furthermore, the sets of metrics included in individual topics ensure completeness of data reported to

investors to assess performance on the topics.

BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS | INVESTMENT BANKING & BROKERAGE INDUSTRY | 26

Revision FN-IB:09 – Industry: Investment Banking &

Brokerage; Topic Name: Management of the Legal &

Regulatory Environment

Summary of Change – Revise Topic Name

The SASB revised the provisional topic name from Management of the Legal & Regulatory Environment to Business

Ethics.

Supporting Rationale

The disclosure topic is intended to capture investment banks’ adherence to a complex and inconsistent set of rules

relating to performance and conduct. In addition, the associated metrics will encourage disclosure on issues, including

insider trading, anti-trust, price fixing, and market manipulation. As such, the topic is intended to measure companies’

policies and practices regarding potentially controversial issues, broadly defined as “business ethics”. On the other

hand, the SASB defines Management of the Legal & Regulatory Environment as a company's strategy and reliance

upon regulatory policy or monetary incentives (such as subsidies and taxes), its actions to influence industry policy

(such as through lobbying), overall reliance on a favorable regulatory environment for business competitiveness, and

ability to comply with relevant regulations. To better reflect the nature of the topic, the SASB has revised the topic

name from Management of the Legal & Regulatory Environment to Business Ethics.

Benefits

Improves the SASB Standard: The revision improves the clarity and accuracy of the disclosure topic name.

Revision FN-IB:10 – Industry: Investment Banking &

Brokerage; Topic Name: Professional Integrity

2017 Technical Agenda Item #2-19 Description

The SASB is evaluating the addition of the topic, including corresponding metrics, based on investor interest and its

potential to affect corporate value.

Summary of Change – Add Topic

The SASB added the disclosure topic Professional Integrity, including the corresponding metrics:

 FN-IB-510b.1 – (1) Number and (2) percentage of covered employees with a record of investment-
related investigations, consumer-initiated complaints, private civil litigations, or other regulatory
proceedings
 FN-IB-510b.2 – Number of mediation and arbitration ca ses associated with professional integrity and
duty of care, by party
 FN-IB-510b.3 – Total amount of monetary losses as a result of legal proceedings associated with
professional integrity, including duty of care
 FN-IB-510b.4 – Description of approach to ensuring professional integrity, including duty of care
Description of Topic

The business model of investment banking and brokerage companies is dependent on the development of client trust

and loyalty. To ensure long-term, mutually beneficial relationships, companies need to provide services that satisfy the

high professional standards of the industry, making professional integrity an important competitive issue. Therefore,

companies in this industry must take measures to avoid conflicts of interest, misrepresentation, and negligence,

including training employees adequately and implementing policies and procedures to ensure employees provide

advice and distribute data free from bias and error. At the same time, professional integrity pertains to following a

code of ethics with respect to transparency and disclosure. These measures are important for both strengthening a

company’s license to operate as well as for attracting and retaining clients. Failure to comply with professional

standards can harm not only the clients who rely on the advice, data, and key services these companies provide, but it

may also negatively affect shareholders. Investment banking and brokerage companies could not only face legal

penalties related to such actions, but also incur significant negative impacts to revenue resulting from reputational

damage. To maintain professional integrity, investment banking and brokerage companies must ensure that

employees have adequate training as well as know and adhere to applicable financial industry regulations. To comply

with Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) rules, employers need to ensure that they are aware of any past

record of violation of their employees who are involved in communications and providing advice to clients. Companies

additionally need to provide clients with transparent and complete information regardless of the products sold or

services provided. Therefore, a description of management’s approach to ensuring professional integrity, including

duty of care would help investors understand risk exposure as well as any processes in place to avoid misconduct.

Additionally, disclosure of the company’s amount of legal and regulatory fines and settlements would provide a

clearer picture of the extent to which financial institutions are adhering to regulatory norms. More specifically,

BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS | INVESTMENT BANKING & BROKERAGE INDUSTRY | 28

company performance in this area can be analyzed in a cost-beneficial way through the direct or indirect performance

metrics associated with this new topic (FN-IB-510b.1 through FN-IB-510b.4, outlined above).

Supporting Analysis

Research indicated that management of the client relationship—specifically, the fiduciary duty investment banks owe

to their clients—should be addressed as a stand-alone disclosure topic rather than as a component of the existing

Management of the Legal & Regulatory Environment topic. Evidence shows that investment banks may be financially

impacted by failing to disclose conflicts of interest or to provide clients with transparent and complete information as

part of advisory services.

There have been multiple cases of violations related to professional integrity and duty to clients involving some of the

largest U.S.-listed financial institutions. In the aftermath of the financial crisis, some of the largest U.S. and

international investment banks paid billions of dollars in regulatory fines and settlements to compensate their clients in

cases related to sales of financial products. The instances related to cases in which companies failed to disclose the

conflict of interest to clients when representing both counterparties on an underwriting transaction or having an

undisclosed incentive to overstate the value or understate the risk of financial products and investment projects. The

magnitude of these fines had a significant impact on the value of banks. Further material impact resulted from the

damaged reputations of these companies, which may be even more difficult to recover.

Metrics included in the disclosure topic are likely to provide complete and decision-useful information to assess

companies’ performance on the issue. A study found that data from BrokerCheck, “including disciplinary records,

financial disclosures, and employment history of brokers has significant power to predict investor harm.”^18 Therefore,

percentage of employees with record of violation could be a forward-looking indicator for client-initiated litigations

and associated fines and settlements. Arbitration and mediation are the two non-judicial proceedings through which

the resolution of problems and disputes in the Investment Banking & Brokerage industry are accomplished.^19 Number

of professional integrity-related arbitration and mediation cases a company was involved in, combined with other

accounting metrics in the disclosure topics, is likely to provide information representative of performance on the

disclosure topic.

Market Input

Investors: Multiple investors consistently found the revised metrics to be decision-useful measures of performance if

reported by companies.

Companies: All five large investment banks that provided feedback on the topic stated that it is relevant to companies

in the industry. Companies stated that it is appropriate to address the issue in a stand-alone topic rather than as a part

of the Management of the Legal & Regulatory Environment topic. Companies stated that metrics are relevant to

measuring performance on professional integrity.

Other: Feedback from a subject matter expert on the revised metric FN-IB-510b.1 “(1) Number and (2) percentage of

litigations, and other regulatory proceedings” suggested the importance of timely filing and updating of regulatory

forms specified in the technical protocol to ensure relevance of the information generated by the metric. Therefore,

the stakeholder suggested including a qualitative note to the metric asking companies how they ensure that the

“covered employees” file such forms in a timely manner as well as promptly update them if any information changes

or becomes inaccurate.

Benefits

Improves the SASB Standard: The revised topic highlights an important sustainability issue in the Investment Banking &

Brokerage industry, where a company’s management—or mismanagement—of the issue is reasonably likely to have a

material financial impact on companies.

Improves decision-usefulness: As highlighted by feedback, the revised metrics provide decision-useful information to

analysts to assess performance of investment banks.

Revision FN-IB:11 – Industry: Investment Banking &

Brokerage; Topic Name: Systemic Risk Management

2017 Technical Agenda Item #2-20 Description

The SASB is evaluating the revision of metric FN0102-10^20 to ensure the decision-usefulness and cost-effectiveness of

the metrics associated with the topic.

Summary of Change – Revise Metrics

The SASB revised metric:

 FN0102-10 – Results of stress tests under adverse economic scenarios, including the following
measures (actual and projection): (1) Loan losses (2) Losses, revenue, and net income before taxes (3)
Tier 1 common capital ratio (4) Tier 1 capital ratio (5) Total risk-based capital ratio (6) Tier 1 leverage
ratio
to metric:

 FN-IB-550a.2 – Description of approach to incorporation of results of mandatory and voluntary stress
tests into capital adequacy planning, long-term corporate strategy, and other business activities
Adherence to Criteria for Accounting Metrics

The Investment Banking & Brokerage Industry Standard includes a topic for Systemic Risk Management with

associated metrics to describe a financial institution’s capacity to operate after economic shocks and the degree to

which its operations may affect other companies and the broader economy. The need to preserve capital due to

regulatory requirements requires that decisions to deploy financial capabilities are weighed against capital

requirements. The provisional metric associated with the topic included reporting on results of regulatory stress tests

under adverse economic scenarios using several actual and projected quantitative indicators. As these data are

currently disclosed in detail, the provisional SASB metric was unlikely to add value to the total mix of information

provided to investors. The revised metric is intended to help analysts assess the alignment of performance on

regulatory metrics with the company’s long-term sustainability strategy by providing a discussion of how the stress

tests drive corporate strategy and other business decisions. A discussion of how the integration of ESG factors in stress

testing and the influence of stress test results on a company’s ESG strategy–as requested in the technical protocol–

provides decision-useful information that is not currently disclosed.

BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS | INVESTMENT BANKING & BROKERAGE INDUSTRY | 31

in these reports is higher than that in metric FN0102-10. In Revision FN-IB:12, the SASB included a quantitative metric

of companies’ Global Systemic Important Bank (G-SIB) scores, which provide a complete set of quantitative data

points relevant to the topic. The G-SIB score, calculated with inputs collected by regulators in G-20 countries, assesses

the systemic risk a financial institution poses through a composite of several metrics. As such, the revised metric adds

to the completeness of the SASB standard.

The revision to a qualitative discussion is valuable to investors to understand how quantitative performance on

regulatory metrics relates to a company’s management of the material sustainability issues addressed in the SASB

standard. Further, discussion of how ESG factors inform the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the stress tests’

modeling and analysis, as well as how the stress test results inform its approach with respect to its ESG strategy,

provide useful information to both companies and investors. Such discussion connects the regulatory and financial

aspects of the topic back to its sustainability aspects, improving the completeness of the standard.

Market Input

Investors: Feedback from multiple investors suggests that the amount of information related to results of stress tests,

and the systemic risk in general, available through the Federal Reserve report, Pillar 3 reports under Basel III, and other

sources is sufficient to make informed investment decisions. Analysts suggested not to restate results of stress tests in

the standard but rather to provide discussion of a long-term strategy to adapt to the evolving regulatory environment

and absorb shocks arising from financial and economic stress.

Companies: All companies who provided feedback supported the change from results of SASB-specific stress tests to

qualitative discussion and analysis. Companies stated that the amount of quantitative data reported satisfies

regulatory requirements and investor demand on the topic. Feedback indicated that the amount of disclosure with

respect to stress tests is sufficient and the provisional metric does not contribute to the completeness of information.

Benefits

Improves the SASB Standard : Duplicating results of the stress tests, in this specific case, would not provide additional

value to investors. The data investors can obtain from regulatory filings on results of stress tests is already complete

and sufficient to make informed decisions. The revised metric is likely to add value to the total mix of information

rather than be duplicative. It allows companies to connect their regulatory performance with the sustainability topic

through the language in the technical protocol.

Improves cost-effectiveness: By reducing the amount of data required from companies, SASB improves the cost-

effectiveness of the standard.

Improves decision-usefulness: As indicated by feedback from investors, a discussion of a company’s strategy provides

more decision-useful information than results of stress tests.

2017 Technical Agenda Item #2-21 Description

SASB is evaluating the revision of metrics FN0102-11,^22 FN0102-12,^23 FN0102-13,^24 and FN0102-14^25 to ensure the

alignment, decision-usefulness, and cost-effectiveness of the metrics associated with the topic.

Summary of Change – Revise Metrics

The SASB removed the following provisional metrics:

 FN0102-11 – Basel III Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR)
 FN0102-12 – Net exposure to written credit derivatives
 FN0102-13 – Level 3 assets: (1) total value and (2) percentage of total assets
 FN0102-14 – Skewness and kurtosis of trading revenue
and replaced them with a new metric:

 FN-IB-550a.1 – Global Systemically Important Bank (G-SIB) score, by category
Adherence to Criteria for Accounting Metrics

The Investment Banking & Brokerage Industry Standard includes a topic, Systemic Risk Management, with associated

provisional metrics that described a financial institution’s capacity to operate after economic shocks and the degree to

which its operations may affect other companies and the broader economy.

The provisional metrics FN0102-11, FN0102-12, FN0102- 13, and FN0102-14 included some of, but not all the

measures of systemic risk normally disclosed in regulatory stress test results. Consequently, they were not complete,

according to the criteria for accounting metrics established in the SASB Conceptual Framework.

The SASB replaced the provisional metrics with one metric measuring the G-SIB score. The change improves the

completeness of the metrics associated with the topic while fairly representing a company’s performance, as it

encompasses a broader view of systemic risk that can be condensed into a single indicator, rather than the multiple

measures included in the Provisional Standard. It also adds to the comparability and alignment of the metrics

associated with the topic, as data for the G-SIB score are calculated using standardized methodology and already

collected by most industry participants and reported to regulators.

BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS | INVESTMENT BANKING & BROKERAGE INDUSTRY | 33

Supporting Analysis

The provisional metrics represent only individual elements of the relevant information investors need to assess a

company’s performance on the topic. The replacement metric measures how a company manages its capital

requirements and whether it is well positioned to absorb shocks arising from financial and economic stress. The G-SIB

score is a measure of the degree to which a bank may pose a risk to the financial system. By measuring a bank’s

relative score in five major categories (size, interconnectedness, complexity, cross-jurisdictional activity, and

substitutability), the metric accounts for different factors that gauge the systemic risk that the institution poses. The

data are already disclosed to national regulators and made public for most of the U.S.’s larger institutions, with similar

standards existing in other jurisdictions. By using a single metric, the revision improves the completeness of data

provided to investors while fairly representing performance on the topic. Banks with over $50 billion in assets are

required to collect and report the data underlying the calculation of G-SIB scores. The methodology for calculating the

scores for each category considers performance on indicators that were captured by the replaced metrics, as well as

other applicable indicators.

G-SIB scores are calculated based on a globally-accepted methodology, which would ensure the comparability and

alignment of the SASB metric. The data used to calculate G-SIB scores, the methodology, and the scores are publicly

available on the Office of Financial Research’s website.^26 Further, companies have established frameworks for

collecting and reporting the underlying data, which makes reporting the revised metric cost-effective.

Market Input

Investors: Multiple investors stated that the provisional metrics are relevant but are only a subset of all the relevant

indicators. Analysts suggested that the disclosure standard should either be broader or it should not duplicate

measures at all. The G-SIB metric was recommended by one investor as the most decision-useful measure of systemic

risk combined into one concise measure.

Companies: The SASB did not receive feedback from companies specifically related to the usefulness of the revised

metric.

Others: Subject matter experts confirmed the decision-usefulness and relevance of the G-SIB metric and its breakdown

by five categories.

Benefits

Improves decision-usefulness: The G-SIB metric satisfies the SASB’s goal of providing a minimal set of decision-useful

metrics. The five G-SIB sub-scores (outlined above) incorporate all the elements of the topic the SASB considers to be

relevant from the sustainability point of view. As such, the revision improves the ability of the metrics associated with

the topic to provide a complete and fair representation of performance in a way that is comparable among peers and

aligned with industry practices.

Improves cost-effectiveness: By aligning with an existing methodology used by industry companies, the revised metric

is more cost-effective to report.

2017 Technical Agenda Item #2-13 Description

SASB is evaluating the revision of metrics FN0102-01,^27 FN0102-02,^28 FN0102-03^29 , and FN0102-04^30 to ensure the

relevance, decision-usefulness, and cost-effectiveness of the metrics associated with the topic.

Summary of Change – Revise Metrics

The SASB removed the following provisional metrics:

 FN0102-01 – Discussion of variable compensation policies and practices
 FN0102-03 – Percentage of variable compensation that is equity for: (1) executives and (2) all others
The SASB also replaced the following provisional metrics:

 FN0102-02 – Percentage of total compensation that is variable for: (1) executives and (2) all others
 FN0102-04 – Percentage of employee compensation which includes ex post adjustments for: (1)
executives and (2) all others
with the following metrics:

 FN-IB-550b.1 – Percentage of total remuneration that is variable for Material Risk Takers (MRTs)
 FN-IB-550b.2 – Percentage of variable remuneration of Material Risk Takers (MRTs) to which malus or
clawback provisions were applied
Adherence to Criteria for Accounting Metrics

The Investment Banking & Brokerage Industry Provisional Standard includes a topic, Employee Incentives & Risk

Taking, with associated metrics to describe how incentives embedded in the compensation structure for employees

contribute to the overall risk profile of an organization. Structures that focus on the short term are likely to encourage

excessive risk taking and present adverse implications for long-term corporate value. Concern over this issue has led to

increased regulatory and shareholder scrutiny since the financial crisis. The topic and associated metrics were intended

to measure fixed and variable remuneration of relevant employees as well as policies on clawback provisions.

The provisional metrics FN0102-02 and FN0102-04 focused on variable remuneration and ex-post adjustments. While

these provisional metrics were relevant to the disclosure topic, their scope was likely too broad, covering categories of

employees whose work and decisions are unlikely to impact the risk profile of the whole organization. The SASB

revised the metric by narrowing the scope of disclosure to employees who are classified as MRTs. This change

BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS | INVESTMENT BANKING & BROKERAGE INDUSTRY | 35

improves fair representation, usefulness, and completeness of accounting metrics and, therefore, also improves the

decision-usefulness of information provided to investors.

In defining MRTs, the SASB uses principles identified in the framework of the Financial Stability Board (FSB) related to

Sound Compensation Practices. The FSB states that “according to survey responses, in most jurisdictions MRTs could

include persons whose professional activities have a material impact on the firms’ risk profile or on the fund being

managed.”^31 To assess the extent to which an employee has the ability to impact to company’s risk profile, certain

criteria need to be used, which may include qualitative and quantitative criteria. The FSB states that “methodologies

for identifying MRTs differ across jurisdictions. In most jurisdictions, identification is largely the responsibility of

individual firms, albeit with guidance, oversight and monitoring from regulators/supervisors.” Additionally, it states:

“larger firms have more complex systems to identify MRTs. Criteria for the identification of MRTs included: role (e.g.

level of seniority), remuneration (variable and/or fixed) and responsibilities (e.g. control function roles, material risk

taking, membership in specific business units or committees, authority to design and approve products, ability to

impact a firm’s capital and liquidity positions including the wider business group).”

Although approaches to classifying employees as MRTs differ across regulatory jurisdictions (based on both qualitative

criteria and quantitative thresholds), the core principle is focused on the employee’s potential to impact an

institution’s risk profile. Therefore, the classification guidance provided in the technical protocol ensures alignment of

the SASB metric with existing regulatory rules, which in its turn, improves cost-effectiveness of reporting. The

approach also ensures fair representation of the SASB metric, i.e., focusing on employees that may impact the

company’s risk profile (underlying principle of the criteria in each jurisdiction). By aligning the technical protocol with

local regulations, the SASB ensures applicability of the metric to foreign entities as well as U.S. entities with global

operations.

Examples of approaches to classify employees as MRTs:

 For the scope of the U.S. jurisdiction, the FSB references the Supervisory Guidance on Sound Incentive
Compensation Policies which “requires banking organizations to distinguish “covered employees”
from other employees, based primarily on control and influence over risk: those receiving incentive
compensation who have an ability, either alone or as a member of a group, to take or influence risk
that is material to the bank or a business within the bank.”
 In Japan, employees must satisfy both of the following conditions: 1) be “highly remunerated” and 2)
their “action has a material impact on the risk profile of the firm” to be identified as MRTs.
 In the EU, staff who meet any of the 15 qualitative criteria or any of the 5 quantitative criteria from the
Regulation 604/2014 shall be identified as having a material impact on an institution's risk profile.
To ensure completeness of information provided by the metric, the SASB included a note that requires companies to

disclose on Risk Committee and/or Chief Risk Officer oversight of remuneration policies of MRTs as part of the firm’s

overall risk management process. Specifically, the discussion includes, but is not limited to: (1) the role and decision-

making process of the Board and the Risk Committee; (2) the role and decision-making process of the Chief Risk

Officer; and (3) how risks associated with remuneration of MRTs are identified, measured, and managed at the firm

level.

The SASB also removed the provisional metrics FN0102-01 and FN0102-03, which, as indicated by research and

feedback received, are unlikely to provide additional value to the overall disclosure on the topic. The discussion of

variable remuneration policies and practices required by the technical protocol of the updated metric FN-IB-550b.1

would eliminate the need for a stand-alone discussion metric. Meanwhile, the share of variable remuneration that is

equity may not provide valuable information beyond the fixed versus variable breakdown. Feedback suggested the

revised set of metrics would be complete, satisfying the criteria for accounting metrics established in the SASB

Conceptual Framework.

Supporting Analysis

Analysis of disclosure in the SEC filings of companies in the industry shows that when large financial institutions

discuss how employee incentives impact riskiness of the firm, they consider such information the context of employees

classified as MRTs. MRTs are typically described in SEC filings as “employees who, as part of their role or function, can

take or influence risk that is material to a business unit or Firm.” This finding supports the adoption of a more

narrowly defined scope of disclosure. Investment banks may employ a significant number of support staff and other

categories of employees whose daily work does not include making material decisions that may impact riskiness of the

organization. Therefore, the clearer definition of the scope of disclosure associated with the revised metrics addresses

these concerns and enhances the fair representation of the accounting metric. Disclosure analysis on the Bloomberg

Professional Service shows a significant number of large, publicly listed banks, primarily those with operations in the

EU, that report the incentive compensation structure for their MRTs.

In the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis, the Financial Stability Forum developed the Principles for Sound

Compensation Practices to ensure governance of compensation, alignment of compensation with prudent risk taking,

and effective supervisory oversight and stakeholder engagement in compensation.^32 The Financial Stability Board (FSB)

states that “according to survey responses, in most ju risdictions MRTs could include persons whose professional

activities have a material impact on the firms’ risk profile or on the fund being managed.” To assess the extent to

which an employee has the ability to impact to company’s risk profile, certain criteria need to be used, which may

include qualitative and quantitative criteria. The FSB states that “methodologies for identifying MRTs differ across

jurisdictions. In most jurisdictions, identification is largely the responsibility of individual firms, albeit with guidance,

oversight and monitoring from regulators/supervisors.” Additionally, it states: “larger firms have more complex

systems to identify MRTs. Criteria for the identification of MRTs included: role (e.g. level of seniority), remuneration

(variable and/or fixed) and responsibilities (e.g. control function roles, material risk taking, membership in specific

business units or committees, authority to design and approve products, ability to impact a firm’s capital and liquidity

positions including the wider business group).”^33

Although approaches to classifying employees as MRTs differ across regulatory jurisdictions (based on both qualitative

criteria and hard quantitative thresholds), the core principle is still centered on an employee’s potential to impact

institution’s risk profile. For example, in the EU, the approach to classification of employees as MRTs was developed by

the European Banking Authority under the Basel III requirements for the variable component of total remuneration of

employees. Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) set out process and criteria for the identification of categories of

staff who have a material impact on the institution’s risk profile. For example, according to a large company in the

industry “MRTs are identified at a Group level and also at a single legal entity level for significant institutions.”^34 The

EU regulation No 604/2014 referenced above requires companies to establish a "general criteria for the assessment of

the materiality of the influence of staff on the institution's risk profile."

The criteria apply globally, as stated in the RTS: “The criteria aim to identify staff whose professional activities have a

material impact on the institution’s risk profile, independent of the actual location of the staff member. The criteria,

when applied at group level, consider the scope of consolidation, including subsidiaries and branches in third-world

countries.”^35

Market Input

Investors: Investors indicated that they would find disclosure on the revised metrics decision-useful and were

supportive of limiting the scope of disclosure to MRTs. Feedback suggested that remuneration of key employees, such

as MRTs, is particularly important in the Investment Banking & Brokerage industry, as compared to Commercial Banks,

Asset Management & Custody Activities, and Consumer Finance. Analysts also agreed that the share of compensation

represented by equity is not decision-useful on its own and should be discussed holistically as part of an overall

incentives structure.

Companies: Companies agreed on the approach of focusing disclosure on MRTs. Companies stated that for

operations where a regulatory environment covering MRTs applies, they currently provide disclosure. The revised

metric on clawback provisions was found to be relevant, and many companies said they currently disclose this

information in qualitative format.

Other: Feedback from a subject matter expert on the metric capturing remuneration of MRTs (FN-IB-550b.1)

suggested providing discussion of how remuneration policies are linked to the Chief Risk Officer as well as risk

management and the Risk Committee.

Benefits

Improves cost-effectiveness: Focusing disclosure on a category of employees with clearly defined criteria reduces the

burden of collecting and preparing the data.

Improves decision-usefulness: By focusing the metric on MRTs, SASB is likely to provide investors with data that is

decision-useful in assessing riskiness of companies in the industry by improving fair representation, usefulness, and

alignment.

Revision FN-IB:14 – Industry: Investment Banking &

Brokerage; Topic Name: Employee Incentives & Risk Taking

2017 Technical Agenda Item #2-14 Description

SASB is evaluating the revision of metric FN0102-05^36 to ensure the relevance, decision-usefulness, and cost-

effectiveness of the metrics associated with the topic.

Summary of Change – Revise Metrics

The SASB revised provisional metric FN0102-05 from “Number of instances when risk limits were breached and

number and percentage by response: (1) position reduced, (2) risk limit temporarily increased, (3) risk limit

permanently increased, (4) other” to “Discussion of policies around supervision, control, and validation of traders’

pricing of Level 3 assets and liabilities.”

Note: The new metric additionally asks companies to discuss incentive-based compensation of employees responsible

for pricing of Level 3 assets and liabilities.

Adherence to Criteria for Accounting Metrics

The Investment Banking & Brokerage Industry Provisional Standard includes a topic, Employee Incentives & Risk

Taking, with associated provisional metrics that encouraged disclosure on a company’s approach to linking the

structure of employee incentives to the firm’s desired level and time horizon of risk taking. Specifically, provisional

metric FN0102-05 asked companies for the number of breaches of trading risk limits and the actions taken to address

the breaches. Although the indicator may have been helpful to illustrate at what level the bank has been breaching

self-determined risk levels and how it resolves those breaches, measures of what constitutes a breach vary significantly

among institutions. Therefore, the provisional metric failed to satisfy the comparability and verifiability criteria of

accounting metrics. The revised metric takes a more informative approach to disclosure on the subject by asking firms

to describe their policies toward supervision, control, and validation of traders’ pricing of Level 3 assets and liabilities.

According to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), a clearer understanding of the company’s policies on

supervision, control and validation of pricing of Level 3 assets and liabilities would help investors better understand

whether traders or managers engage in “non–bona fide” valuations to enhance compensation or other benefits.^37 A

lack of control over how assets are priced may incent ivize employees to misrepresent them to boost short-term

compensation. The revision improves fair representation, relevance, and completeness of the metrics included in the

disclosure topic by providing decision-useful information for assessing company performance on the topic. Aligning

the disclosure with the FINRA rules also improves alignment and comparability of the revised metric.

Supporting Analysis

FINRA highlights the policies around supervision, control, and validation of traders’ pricing of Level 3 assets in the

‘Supervision, Risk Management and Controls, Management of Conflicts of Interest’ section of the ‘2016 Regulatory

and Examination Priorities Letter’.^38 The policies specifically address the incentive-compensation structure of

proprietary traders. This fact highlights the importance of the issue to the stakeholders and the capital market overall.

Therefore, aligning the disclosure with the FINRA rules improves alignment and comparability of the metric.

Analysis of disclosures made by industry firms shows that at least five of the 20 publicly listed investment banks

provide discussion related to the revised metric in SEC filings, while all discuss compliance with the FINRA guidance

and provide disclosure of their Level 3 assets. The SASB analysis of corporate filings found no instances of quantitative

or qualitative disclosures related to the provisional metric FN0102-05. Several large investment banks mention the

FINRA rules related to pricing of Level 3 assets in the SEC filings. Consequently, the changes in the metric should

contribute to the fair representation and relevance criteria for SASB accounting metrics, while remaining cost-effective

due to their alignment, comparability, and verifiability.

Market Input

Companies: Some of the largest companies in the industry stated that reporting on provisional metric FN0102- 05

would be extremely difficult to standardize as companies could have significantly different definitions of “risk-limit

breaches” as well as significant differences in the nature of activities involved and implications of breaches.

Companies felt strongly that the provisional metric did not provide information that was representative of company

performance on the disclosure topic. The companies expressed concerns that, as structured, the provisional metric

could generate information that would be challenging for investors to interpret due to the lack of clarity in the

technical protocol. The revised metric was found to be relevant by a few large investment banks.

Investors: While investors conceptually saw the relevance and value in provisional metric FN0102-05, they did not

expect companies to disclose such data. The revised metric was found to be relevant and decision-useful, as it aligns

with the FINRA framework, which would generate comparable data among companies.

Benefits

Improves decision-usefulness: The revised metric improves alignment with the FINRA framework relating to incentive

compensation and riskiness, thereby satisfying the criteria of fair representation and relevance, and improving

decision-usefulness.

Improves alignment and cost-effectiveness: As disclosure analysis suggests, some companies already provide disclosure

on the revised metric in their SEC filings. These companies cite FINRA requirements with which they must comply. By

aligning the revised metric with the FINRA, the SASB improves alignment, comparability, and verifiability of the

metrics, ensuring cost-effectiveness of the standard.

Revision FN-IB:15 – Industry: Investment Banking &

Brokerage; Topic Name: Activity Metrics

2017 Technical Agenda Item #2-25 Description

The SASB proposes to include activity metrics for the Investment Banking & Brokerage industry.

Summary of Change – Add Activity Metrics

The SASB added the following activity metrics:

 FN-IB-000.A – (1) Number and (2) value of (a) underwriting, (b) advisory, and (c) securitization
transactions
 FN-IB-000.B – (1) Number and (2) value of proprietary investments and loans by sector
 FN-IB-000.C – (1) Number and (2) total value of market making transactions in (a) fixed income, (b)
equity, (c) currency, (d) derivatives, and (e) commodity products
Supporting Analysis

The SASB added activity metrics as a new element of the Investment Banking & Brokerage Standard. At the time of

release of the provisional standards for the Financials sector, the SASB had not incorporated the concept of activity

metrics into the industry standards. Activity metrics are useful for measuring the scope and scale of a company’s

operations, providing normalization factors for the performance metrics included in the disclosure topics.

The added metrics measure the scope of key business activities of three key segments as disclosed in companies’ SEC

filings (Investment Banking, Investing & Lending, and Institutional Client Services activities). The metrics are aligned

with those used to measure performance in these segments in the league tables published by third-party data

providers.

Market Input

Investors: The SASB received feedback from a limited number of investors on activity metrics. Analysts providing

comments stated that the added metrics are relevant, decision-useful, and partially disclosed already through third-

party data providers. Investors would see value in this information coming from companies directly.

Companies: Feedback from four of the largest investment banks indicates that the added metrics are cost-effective to

report as they are aligned with internally collected information and, for the most part, are already disclosed in league

tables.

Benefits

Improves the SASB Standard: Activity metrics provide investors with normalization factors to ensure comparability of

SASB metrics across companies.

Improves decision-usefulness: The added metrics improve decision-usefulness of all quantitative SASB metrics included

in the standard by allowing investors to convert them from absolute to relative measures of performance.

Appendix B. Redline Metric Tables

Redline tables are provided below for all sustainability accounting metrics (Table 1) and activity metrics (Table 2). All

significant revisions to topics and metrics between the provisional standard and the codified standard are shown in

redline; however, such redlines are not intended to communicate the full scope of such revisions, for which readers

should refer to the codified Standard and accompanying content elsewhere in the Basis for Conclusions.

All redlines presented in these tables are associated with a revision number in the Revision Number column. Significant

revisions to the technical protocol associated with a given metric will not necessarily be apparent in redline in the

tables; however, the associated revision number will be noted in the Revision Number column of each table.

Any redlines that depict revisions to metrics but that are not accompanied by a revision number (i.e., “n/a”) are not

addressed in the Basis for Conclusions as these revisions have not altered the scope or content of metrics, such as

those that are intended to improve the consistency, clarity, and accuracy of the standard. Similarly, if a metric is not

accompanied by a revision number, the technical protocol may have been revised to improve the consistency, clarity,

and accuracy of the standard.

These materials were developed under the auspices of the SASB Foundation. The SASB Foundation was founded in 2011

as a not-for-profit, independent standards-setting organization. The SASB Foundation’s mission was to establish and

maintain industry-specific standards that assist companies in disclosing financially material, decision-useful sustainability

information to investors. The SASB Foundation operated in a governance structure similar to the structure adopted by other

internationally recognized bodies that set standards for disclosure to investors, including the Financial Accounting Standards

Board (FASB) and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). This structure included a board of directors (“the

Foundation Board”) and a standards-setting board (“the Standards Board” or “the SASB”). The Standards Board developed,

issued, and maintained the SASB Standards. The Foundation Board oversaw the strategy, finances, and operations of

the entire organization, and appointed the members of the Standards Board. The Foundation Board was not involved in

setting standards, but was responsible for overseeing the Standards Board’s compliance with the organization’s due process

requirements. As set out in the SASB Rules of Procedure, the SASB’s standards-setting activities were transparent and

followed careful due process, including extensive consultation with companies, investors, and relevant experts. The SASB

Foundation was funded by a range of sources, including contributions from philanthropies, companies, and individuals, as

well as through the sale and licensing of publications, educational materials, and other products.

INTRODUCTION

Purpose of SASB Standards

The SASB’s use of the term “sustainability” refers to corporate activities that maintain or enhance the ability of the

company to create value over the long term. Sustainability accounting reflects the governance and management of a

company’s environmental and social impacts arising from production of goods and services, as well as its governance and

management of the environmental and social capitals necessary to create long-term value. The SASB also refers to

sustainability as “ESG” (environmental, social, and governance), though traditional corporate governance issues such as

board composition are not included within the scope of the SASB’s standards-setting activities.

SASB standards are designed to identify a minimum set of sustainability issues most likely to impact the operating

performance or financial condition of the typical company in an industry, regardless of location. SASB standards are

designed to enable communications on corporate performance on industry-level sustainability issues in a cost-effective

and decision-useful manner using existing disclosure and reporting mechanisms.

Businesses can use the SASB standards to better identify, manage, and communicate to investors sustainability

information that is financially material. Use of the standards can benefit businesses by improving transparency, risk

management, and performance. SASB standards can help investors by encouraging reporting that is comparable,

consistent, and financially material, thereby enabling investors to make better investment and voting decisions.

Overview of SASB Standards

The SASB has developed a set of 77 industry-specific sustainability accounting standards (“SASB standards” or “industry

standards”), categorized pursuant to SASB’s Sustainable Industry Classification System® (SICS®). Each SASB standard

describes the industry that is the subject of the standard, including any assumptions about the predominant business

model and industry segments that are included. SASB standards include:

Disclosure topics – A minimum set of industry-specific disclosure topics reasonably likely to constitute material
information, and a brief description of how management or mismanagement of each topic may affect value creation.

Accounting metrics – A set of quantitative and/or qualitative accounting metrics intended to measure performance
on each topic.

Technical protocols – Each accounting metric is accompanied by a technical protocol that provides guidance on
definitions, scope, implementation, compilation, and presentation, all of which are intended to constitute suitable criteria

for third-party assurance.

Activity metrics – A set of metrics that quantify the scale of a company’s business and are intended for use in
conjunction with accounting metrics to normalize data and facilitate comparison.

SUSTAINABILITY ACCOUNTING STANDARD | INVESTMENT BANKING & BROKERAGE | 4

Furthermore, the SASB Standards Application Guidance establishes guidance applicable to the use of all industry

standards and is considered part of the standards. Unless otherwise specified in the technical protocols contained in the

industry standards, the guidance in the SASB Standards Application Guidance applies to the definitions, scope,

implementation, compilation, and presentation of the metrics in the industry standards.

The SASB Conceptual Framework sets out the basic concepts, principles, definitions, and objectives that guide the

Standards Board in its approach to setting standards for sustainability accounting. The SASB Rules of Procedure is focused

on the governance processes and practices for standards setting.

Use of the Standards

SASB standards are intended for use in communications to investors regarding sustainability issues that are likely to

impact corporate ability to create value over the long term. Use of SASB standards is voluntary. A company determines

which standard(s) is relevant to the company, which disclosure topics are financially material to its business, and which

associated metrics to report, taking relevant legal requirements into account^1. In general, a company would use the SASB

standard specific to its primary industry as identified in SICS®. However, companies with substantial business in multiple

SICS® industries can consider reporting on these additional SASB industry standards.

It is up to a company to determine the means by which it reports SASB information to investors. One benefit of using

SASB standards may be achieving regulatory compliance in some markets. Other investor communications using SASB

information could be sustainability reports, integrated reports, websites, or annual reports to shareholders. There is no

guarantee that SASB standards address all financially material sustainability risks or opportunities unique to a company’s

business model.

Industry Description

The Investment Banking & Brokerage industry consists of firms performing a wide range of functions in the capital

markets, including assisting with the capital-raising and allocation process, and providing market-making and advisory

services for corporations, financial institutions, governments, and high net-worth individuals. Specific activities include

financial advisory and securities underwriting services conducted on a fee basis; securities and commodities brokerage

activities, which involves buying and selling securities or commodities contracts and options on a commission or fee basis

for investors; and trading and principal investment activities, which involves the buying and selling of equities, fixed

income, currencies, commodities, and other securities for client-driven and proprietary trading. Investment banks also

originate and securitize loans for infrastructure and other projects. Companies in the industry generate their revenues

from global markets and, therefore, are exposed to various regulatory environments. The industry continues to face

regulatory pressure to reform and disclose aspects of operations that present systemic risks. Specifically, firms are facing

new capital requirements, stress testing, limits on proprietary trading, and increased scrutiny on compensation practices.

(^1) Legal Note : SASB standards are not intended to, and indeed cannot, replace any legal or regulatory requirements that may be
applicable to a reporting entity’s operations.
SUSTAINABILITY ACCOUNTING STANDARD | INVESTMENT BANKING & BROKERAGE | 5

Note: The SASB Investment Banking & Brokerage (FN-IB) Standard addresses “pure play” investment banking and

brokerage services, which the SASB recognizes may not include all the activities of integrated financial institutions, such

as mortgage finance, commercial banking, consumer finance, asset management and custody services, and insurance.

Separate SASB accounting standards are available that address the sustainability issues for activities in those industries.

Employee Diversity & Inclusion

Topic Summary

Investment banking and brokerage companies face a high degree of competition for skilled employees. At the same time,

the industry has a low level of diversity, especially among senior roles. In recent years, considerable media attention has

been focused on cases of gender discrimination involving publicly listed companies in the industry. As the industry

continues to undergo rapid innovation through the introduction of more complex financial products and computerized

algorithmic and high-frequency trading, the ability of companies to attract and retain skilled employees will likely become

increasingly material. By ensuring gender and racial diversity throughout the organization, companies are likely to expand

their candidate pool, which could lower hiring cost and improve operational efficiency. Further, evidence suggests that

diverse groups of employees at investment banking and brokerage companies may reduce risk taking for employees

involved in risk-prone trading activities (e.g., trading), which could lower risk exposure of the firm as a whole. Enhanced

disclosure regarding employee gender and racial/ethnic diversity, especially when provided by employee category, will

allow shareholders to assess how companies in this industry are managing these risks and opportunities.

Accounting Metrics

FN-IB-330a.1. Percentage of gender and racial/ethnic group representation for (1)

executive management, (2) non-executive management, (3) professionals, and (4)

all other employees

1 The entity shall disclose gender representation for all employees and racial/ethnic group representation for its U.S.

employees by employee category.
1.1 The following employee categories shall be used: (1) executive management, (2) non-executive management,
(3) professionals, and (4) all other employees.
2 Gender and racial/ethnic group representation shall be disclosed in percentages, where the percentage shall be

calculated as the number of employees in each gender or racial/ethnic group in each employee category divided by
the total number of employees in the respective employee category.
3 For U.S. employees, the entity shall categorize the employees in accordance with the Equal Employment Opportunity

Commission’s Employer Information EEO-1 report (EEO-1 Survey) Instruction Booklet, where each employee category
for disclosure is defined by corresponding job categories and descriptions in the Instruction Booklet:
3.1 Executive management includes Executives/Senior Level Officials and Managers: individuals who plan, direct
and formulate policies, set strategy and provide the overall direction of enterprises/organizations for the
development and delivery of products or services, within the parameters approved by boards of directors or
other governing bodies. Residing in the highest levels of organizations, these executives plan, direct or
coordinate activities with the support of subordinate executives and staff managers. They include, in larger
SUSTAINABILITY ACCOUNTING STANDARD | INVESTMENT BANKING & BROKERAGE | 9
organizations, those individuals within two reporting levels of the CEO, whose responsibilities require frequent
interaction with the CEO. Examples of these kinds of managers are: chief executive officers, chief operating
officers, chief financial officers, line of business heads, presidents or executive vice presidents of functional
areas or operating groups, chief information officers, chief human resources officers, chief marketing officers,
chief legal officers, management directors and managing partners.
3.2 Non-executive management includes First/Mid-Level Officials and Managers: individuals who serve as
managers, other than those who serve as Executive/Senior Level Officials and Managers, including those who
oversee and direct the delivery of products, services or functions at group, regional or divisional levels of
organizations. These managers receive directions from the Executive/Senior Level management and typically
lead major business units. They implement policies, programs and directives of executive/senior management
through subordinate managers and within the parameters set by Executive/Senior Level management.
Examples of these kinds of managers are: vice presidents and directors, group, regional or divisional
controllers; treasurers; human resources, information systems, marketing, and operations managers. The
First/Mid-Level Officials and Managers subcategory also includes those who report directly to middle
managers. These individuals serve at functional, line of business segment or branch levels and are responsible
for directing and executing the day-to-day operational objectives of enterprises/organizations, conveying the
directions of higher level officials and managers to subordinate personnel and, in some instances, directly
supervising the activities of exempt and non-exempt personnel. The EEO-1 Job Classification Guide provides
examples of job titles in this category.
3.3 Professionals is defined as the following: most jobs in this category require bachelor and graduate degrees,
and/or professional certification. In some instances, comparable experience may establish a person’s
qualifications. The EEO-1 Job Classification Guide provides examples of job titles in this category.
3.4 All other employees includes those employees who are not classified as executive management, non-executive
management, or professionals.
4 For non-U.S. employees, the entity shall categorize the employees in a manner generally consistent with the

definitions provided above, though in accordance with, and further facilitated by, any applicable local regulations,
guidance, or generally accepted definitions.

Incorporation of Environmental, Social, and Governance

Factors in Investment Banking & Brokerage Activities

Topic Summary

Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors can have material implications for the companies, assets, and

projects that investment banks provide services to or invest in across a range of industries. Therefore, by taking these

factors into account in their underwriting, advisory, and investing and lending activities, investment banks can address

significant positive and negative environmental and social externalities. The potential for both value creation and loss

associated with ESG factors suggests that investment banking and brokerage firms have a responsibility to their

shareholders and clients to incorporate consideration of these factors into analysis and valuation related to all core

products, including sell-side research, advisory services, origination, underwriting, and principal transactions. Investment

banking and brokerage companies that fail to address these risks and opportunities could expose themselves to increased

reputational and financial risks. On the other hand, appropriately pricing ESG risks could reduce investment banks’

financial risk exposure, help generate additional revenue, and/or open new market opportunities. To help investors

understand how well companies in the industry manage performance around this issue, investment banks should disclose

how ESG factors are incorporated into their core products and services.

Business Ethics

Topic Summary

The regulatory environment surrounding investment banking and brokerage companies continues to evolve both

nationally and internationally. Companies are required to adhere to a complex and often inconsistent set of rules relating

to performance and conduct as well as provide disclosure on issues including insider trading, anti-trust, price fixing, and

market manipulation. In addition, investment banking and brokerage companies are subject to rules against tax evasion,

fraud, money laundering, and corrupt practices. Finally, in some jurisdictions, enhanced rewards for whistleblowers may

lead to an increase in the number of complaints brought to regulators. Firms that are able to ensure regulatory

compliance through robust internal controls will be better positioned to build trust with clients, leading to increased

revenue, and to protect shareholder value by minimizing losses incurred as a result of legal proceedings.

Professional Integrity

Topic Summary

The business model of investment banking and brokerage companies is dependent on the development of client trust and

loyalty. To ensure long-term, mutually beneficial relationships, companies need to provide services that satisfy the highest

professional standards of the industry, which means taking measures to avoid conflicts of interest, misrepresentation, and

negligence. Professional integrity also pertains to following a code of ethics with respect to transparency and disclosure.

These measures are important both for strengthening a company’s license to operate as well as for attracting and

retaining clients. Failure to comply with professional standards can harm not only the clients who rely on the advice, data,

and key services these companies provide, but it may also negatively affect shareholders. Investment banking and

brokerage companies could not only face legal penalties related to such actions, but also incur significant negative

impacts on revenue from reputational damage. To maintain professional integrity, investment banking and brokerage

companies need to ensure that employees have adequate training as well as know and adhere to applicable financial

industry regulations. To comply with industry laws and regulations, employers need to ensure that they are aware of any

past record of violation of employees who are involved in communications and providing advice to clients. Therefore, a

description of management’s approach to assuring professional integrity can help investors understand risk exposure as

well as any processes in place to avoid misconduct. Additionally, disclosure of the company’s amount of legal and

regulatory fines and settlements can provide a clearer picture of the extent to which financial institutions are adhering to

regulatory norms.

Systemic Risk Management

Topic Summary

The 2008 financial crisis demonstrated the importance of managing risks to capital in the Investment Banking &

Brokerage industry. Specifically, firms that failed to manage these risks suffered significant losses to the value of their

financial assets while increasing the amount of liabilities held on the books, which, due to the interconnectedness of the

financial system, contributed to a significant market disruption. The systemic nature of risk resulting from the

interconnectedness of financial institutions has become a central concern of federal and international regulators. As a

result, many banks are required to undergo supervisory stress tests to evaluate whether the company has the capital and

liquidity to absorb losses, continue operations, and meet obligations in the event of adverse economic and financial

conditions. Their failure to meet regulatory requirements could substantially raise future compliance cost as well as lead to

monetary penalties. In an effort to demonstrate how these risks associated with banks’ size, complexity,

interconnectedness, substitutability, and cross-jurisdictional activity are being managed, investment banks should enhance

disclosure on quantitative and qualitative metrics measuring how well they are positioned to absorb shocks arising from

systemic financial and economic stress and meet stricter regulatory requirements.

Accounting Metrics

indicators used in calculation of the G-SIB or calculates the score internally using the Bank of International
Settlements' (BIS) methodology.
2 The entity shall describe whether its relevant regulatory authority requires the entity to report the data required for

the G-SIB calculation or the entity chooses to report the data voluntarily.

Employee Incentives & Risk Taking

Topic Summary

Employee compensation structures in the Investment Banking & Brokerage industry can incentivize employees to focus on

short-term or long-term company performance. Structures that have excessive focus on the short-term performance are

likely to encourage excessive risk-taking and present adverse implications for long-term corporate value. Concern over this

issue has led to increased regulatory and shareholder scrutiny since the 2008 financial crisis. Improved disclosure of

employee compensation, focusing on the use of performance metrics and variable remuneration, policies around

clawback provisions, supervision, control, and validation of traders' pricing of Level 3 assets will provide investors with a

clear understanding of how investment banking companies are protecting corporate value.

Accounting Metrics

Living Our Values

SVB’s values guide our actions. We help investors and promising companies
innovate, thrive and create jobs; provide a culture where our employees can
learn and grow; and, together with our clients and employees, build a more
equitable and sustainable world. Five core values dene our culture and
serve as a foundation for conducting business and guiding our ESG program.
Our ESG Strategy and Goals

We are working holistically across SVB and with our stakeholders to continue
to enhance our ESG initiatives, leveraging our deep relationships with
investors and innovation companies, as well as our capabilities, resources
and networks, to drive the most impact. We identied the most relevant
ESG priorities based on our purpose and strategy, stakeholder feedback,
ESG reporting frameworks and standards, and industry best practices.
The results of our assessment informed our approach to address critical,
long-term needs for our business and stakeholders. We grouped these
ESG priorities into six strategic initiatives to focus our ESG efforts:

Creating a Community of

Engaged and Inspired Employees

By listening to our employees and investing in their professional
development and well-being, we support their dedication to helping our
clients succeed and delivering great outcomes for our shareholders and
communities. SVB fosters a culture of respect, equity and belonging led by
our corporate SVB Values. We offer holistic benets to support the mental,
physical and nancial well-being of our employees and their families. We
also offer learning and development opportunities to help our employees
realize their potential and achieve their personal career goals for long-term
success. Our comprehensive suite of employee benets helps us attract
and retain the talent we need to grow our business and help fuel the
innovation economy.
More information about life at SVB can be found on our Careers
website or on our Instagram channel @siliconvalleybank #lifeatsvb.
Listening to Our Employees

We encourage regular and transparent feedback. Twice a year we
survey all employees regarding happiness, retention and inclusion at
SVB. We share the ndings with all employees and take action in areas
needing improvement. By leveraging technology, we deliver regular,
targeted guidance to our managers based on their team’s survey feedback.
This helps managers make incremental improvements throughout the year.

How We Listen

We listened to our employees when creating the Connected Workplace,
our exible working model that provides employees with options to shape
the way they work. In the Connected Workplace we embrace the best
of remote and in-person collaboration, with most employees managing
their day-to-day work from home and using our oces to collaborate and
connect with our clients, our business and, most importantly, each other.
Talent Attraction, Retention and Promotion

Professional Development

SVB’s Value to keep learning and improving underpins our approach to the
professional development of our employees. SVB’s Associate Development
Program (ADP) gives entry-level associates advanced, hands-on training
in areas such as credit risk assessment, loan portfolio management and
client relationship skills. Twice a year, we select more than 30 recent college
graduates and working professionals (with up to two years’ experience) to
join a cohort. Each cohort completes 10 weeks of intensive training, followed
by 8-18 months of direct team rotational support, with each rotation lasting
six months and associates typically completing three rotations during their
journey in the ADP program. Our Palo Alto/San Francisco, New York City and
Newton, Massachusetts locations are regional hubs for this premier entry-
level development opportunity, allowing the associates to work closely with
SVB professionals supporting our clients.
Our Global Learning Delivery Center (GLDC) provides the learning
management delivery framework to support SVB’s strategic direction
globally. GLDC drives commitment to learning objectives by serving as
the core growth engine for SVB’s business landscape to develop our
talent. From LinkedIn Learning and degreed courses to formal leadership
development programs, our learning and talent development offerings
are expanding to equip our employees with the skills and knowledge
they need today and tomorrow.
For employees seeking development through formal education programs,
SVB offers Education Assistance, which includes reimbursement for tuition,
fees and textbooks required to earn a certication, designation or degree
relevant to their career path at SVB.

Benets

Supporting our employees with comprehensive and competitive benets
helps us attract and retain the best talent in the industry. We continuously
seek new ways to support our employees, and added several new benets
to our package in 2021:
- Mental well-being: We introduced a service called Modern Health
to provide our employees and their families with a new way to receive
free, condential mental health support during the uncertain times of
the COVID-19 pandemic. We also increased the benets offered through
our Employee Assistance Program, which offers counseling on a
variety of topics for our employees. All regular full- and part-time
employees, their spouses (legal or common law) and dependent
children (to age 26) are eligible for this program.
- Physical well-being: We expanded our health insurance to offer
SVB employees an additional medical plan option at a lower monthly
contribution. This new plan provides comprehensive medical and
pharmacy coverage, uses the same robust provider network as other
plans and allows employees to set aside pretax funds to pay for
healthcare expenses via a Health Savings Account.
- Financial well-being: We also added an ESG Index Fund to our 401(k)
and Deferred Compensation Plan so employees have additional
investment opportunities that may align with their personal nancial
objectives and priorities. The Index excludes companies that do
not meet the United Nations Global Compact principles and certain
diversity standards.

SVB offers competitive benets in all our international locations. For a full
list of our benets by region, please visit our Global Careers webpage.
Mental well-being

At SVB, your mental health is
considered just as important as your
physical health — and we provide
access to a wide variety of training,
coaching and counseling options to
support you when you need it.
Physical well-being

No matter which location you call
home, we provide benets, support
and resources to help you stay
active, healthy and connected.

retirement plans, we have targeted
resources to help you along the way.

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Statement

Inclusion Ignites Innovation

We are intentionally and strategically working for a world where every
client and employee has the opportunity to bring their bold ideas to life.
We also know that diverse perspectives and inclusive environments ignite
new ideas to power innovation. That is why we’re building a culture of
belonging with a global workforce that celebrates greater dimensions
of diversity and reects the markets we strive to serve.
Overview

Guided by our rst Chief Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Ocer (CDEIO) who
has more than 20 years of experience, 2021 was a foundational year, setting
the stage for all we will accomplish over the coming years. We created a
diversity, equity and inclusion framework that enabled us to build on past
progress, capitalize on our unique strengths and acknowledge that we’re
on a continuous journey of learning and improving. We are laser-focused on
fostering an employee-centric culture that is reinforced by our core values.
Our DEI work is categorized into three pillars:

Talent
We will ensure equitable
access and opportunity
to increase the diversity
of our global workforce
Ecosystem
We will harness the power
of innovation to deliver
transformative results to
employees, shareholders
and partners
Inclusion
We will deliver a connected
workplace where
employees feel valued
and are part of something
greater, wherever they are
Building a Culture of

Diversity, Equity and

Inclusion at SVB

2021 was a transformative

year for diversity, equity

and inclusion at SVB.

We made many strides

by building a strong

foundation; and we look

forward to another great

year of furthering our

journey to create, nurture

and sustain a global,

inclusive culture — where

different perspectives

drive innovation.

Our CDEIO sits within Human Resources and partners with the CEO
and Executive Committee to support and execute the DEI strategy.
Our CDEIO also briefs management on various talent initiatives and
key workforce metrics. We understand that systemic change requires
a major commitment and we’re in the early stages of a transformational
journey to ultimately enable equitable access and opportunity within the
SVB global workforce and the larger innovation ecosystem. We support
these efforts with a Code of Conduct based on respect.
For additional information on how we are implementing our DEI strategy,
please see our DEI Overview.
2021 Highlights

Hired a team of subject matter experts to form an Oce of Inclusive
Excellence that leads collaboration, designs practical solution-based
outcomes and provides tools, research and advisory services across
SVB’s workforce.
Launched our rst six Employee Resource Groups (ERGs). We were
strategic in our approach to ensure every group had the resources to
accomplish their mission and allow ERG leaders to be recognized for
their contributions.
Designed an internal diversity dashboard to glean insights about our
representation metrics and track employee life cycle trends, including
employee mobility by gender, race and ethnicity. We also publicly
disclosed our 2020 and 2021 EEO-1 workforce demographics to
promote transparency.
Implemented a diverse candidate slate mandate for US senior leader
roles to ensure hiring leaders were exposed to a range of diverse
candidates during the interview process.
Launched our rst Inclusion Index to understand how our employees
currently experience SVB, and identied opportunities to strengthen
our culture of inclusion, with the goal of enabling everyone to feel
valued as a contributor at SVB.
Introduced Conversation Circles, Real Talk gatherings and Next Now
thought leadership sessions to encourage employee awareness
and discussion on contemporary societal topics.
Published our second annual UK Gender Pay Gap Report , and launched
employee DEI learning paths, leadership development and strategic
partnerships to support our strategy and achieve long-term aspirations.

Attracting Talent

Our employees are what make SVB successful, and if we don’t have the
best talent, we will not win in the marketplace. We understand there is
continuous opportunity for improvement with regard to women and racial
and ethnic populations in the workplace. We saw incremental progress
in 2021 and acknowledge there’s much more work to be done.
Women represent 46% of our global workforce, an increase
of 1 percentage point since 2020.
Black/African American employees represent 5% of our
US workforce, up 1 percentage point since 2020.
Hispanic/Latinx employees represent 9% of our US workforce,
up 1 percentage point since 2020.
Two or more races, Native Hawaiian/Other Pacic Islander and
American Indian/Alaska Native employees, represent 4% of our
US workforce, and this percentage has remained at since 2020.

Attracting the best talent in the market will not happen without accelerated
commitments. There is a clear opportunity to improve representation
across all levels, especially for women, Black/African American and
Hispanic/Latinx individuals in senior leadership. We are prioritizing these
efforts and introduced goals earlier this year to strengthen hiring and
amplify talent development initiatives to create paths to senior leadership.
Please see page 12 for more information on our goals. (To align with
government reporting requirements, the data uses gender categories of
male and female. SVB recognizes that this does not reect all genders
including people identifying as trans and non-binary.).
Promoting an Inclusive Workplace

In 2021, we introduced the Inclusion Index, comprised of six questions
to measure employee sentiment, as part of our semiannual employee
happiness and retention survey. We also stay regularly informed by
listening to employee sentiment shared at our quarterly DEI town halls,
Real Talk conversations and other informal feedback loops. We successfully
launched our rst six Employee Resource Groups to raise the visibility of
our diverse workforce and offer formal and informal development
opportunities. In addition, we launched a learning journey series of
courses focused on allyship.
SVB ESG REPORT 23
ABOUT SVB ESG GOALS TALENT DEI AT SVB ECONOMIC IMPACT CITIZENSHIP ENVIRONMENTCLIMATE AND GOVERNANCE

We embrace and support diverse families globally, no
matter how our employees choose to dene family. We
offer our inclusive family-building benet for every path
to parenthood, including for single parents by choice,
LGBTQ+ individuals and couples, and those choosing
to preserve their fertility. Our benets offer adoption and
surrogacy services, among other family benets, and
cover transgender reassignment surgery.
We are committed to providing human resource policies
that are relevant, benecial and reective of our values.
Our Code of Conduct, which is an extension of our values,
provides a set of principles guiding professional and
personal conduct for our employees as they engage with
each other and interact with our clients and communities.
Embedded in our Code are Anti-Discrimination and Sexual
Harassment policies that express our zero tolerance for
discriminatory or harassing behavior in our workplaces
or while conducting business.
Moving Forward

In 2022, we are positioned to further build on our
foundation. In the rst half of the year, we partnered with
a premier consulting rm to measure how our employees
individually experience belonging, measure the maturity
of our talent pipeline, and measure our DEI infrastructure
and initiatives. We facilitated focus groups in the US and
international regions and captured the perspectives and
experiences of more than 1,900 employees across SVB.
From our assessment, we learned our employees see
and appreciate our commitment to DEI, and opportunities
exist to increase representation for women and historically
underrepresented groups in senior leadership in order to
create a level playing eld for all.
Our talent programs and initiatives will continue to
evolve to address:
Leadership accountability with a DEI lens in everyday
behaviors, operations, recruiting and retention efforts
Retention of women and diverse talent in the workforce
Equitable access to growth opportunities for all remote
teammates (or employees)
Lastly, we will continue to routinely seek action on
employee feedback as a key mechanism for measuring
overall sentiment as we build on our DEI foundation.
Supplier Diversity

The value provided by our vendors has a direct impact
on our business, which is why we consider the quality,
experience, capability, local community commitment, prices
and relationship of each vendor. As part of creating a more
diverse, equitable and inclusive environment at SVB, we
work closely with our vendors to expand our use of suppliers
to include underrepresented racial and ethnic groups,
women, veterans, people with disabilities and the LGBTQ+
community. By 2026, we will expand our corporate supplier
annual spend with businesses owned by members of
underserved communities to at least 8%.
Going forward, we will continue to build and optimize our
partnerships with diverse organizations.

Access to Innovation

Access to Innovation is SVB’s signature program designed to deliver on
our commitment to advance inclusion and opportunity in the innovation
economy, particularly for women, Black and Latinx individuals.
We aim to harness SVB’s resources, experience and connections to address
key barriers that prevent underrepresented groups from achieving positions
of inuence in the innovation sector, including access to information, capital
and networks. We develop strategic partnerships — such as with Venture
Forward, the nonprot arm of the National Venture Capital Association
focused on increasing diverse representation in the industry — and leverage
our expertise to develop tools, programming and career experiences.
The goal is to increase the pipeline of diverse talent for our client companies,
from entry level to board member. We aim to reach 10,000 individuals
annually with access to information, education and career opportunities.
In 2021, we reached 6,058 lives through events and mentorship.

In 2021, we launched our SVB Fellows Program, our initiative focused
on supporting efforts to build a more diverse, equitable and inclusive
innovation economy. The program is designed for Black, Latinx and women
professionals looking to launch a career in venture capital. The fellowship
program, created to address historically low diversity in the venture capital
ecosystem, will connect talented, emerging professionals with entry-level
positions at top venture capital rms. Fellowships last one to two years
and are salaried with benets or include a stipend to cover benets.
SVB plans to support 20 fellows throughout 2022, identied in
partnership with the Black Venture Capital Consortium (BVCC) on a
rolling basis. Candidates are professionals who had previously participated
in BVCC’s career development programming. As the program expands,

Opening Doors for Emerging Talent

SVB partners with several organizations such as Career Ready in the UK,
Year Up and ProMazo that help young people unlock their potential and
prepare for a successful career. For example, Year Up encourages young
adults ages 18 to 24 to reach their potential through an intensive one-year

Community Benets Plan

As a leader in the innovation economy, we strive to use our resources,
voice and inuence to help build strong communities and contribute
to economic and social progress where we live and work. In 2021, we
announced our $11.2 billion Community Benets Plan that builds on our
long-standing commitment to support small businesses, nance affordable
housing, reinvest in low- and moderate-income communities in Massachusetts
and California, and support charitable causes via philanthropy and volunteering.
The commitment will take place over a ve-year period from January 2022
through December 2026.

Community Reinvestment Act

In 2021, we received our rst “Outstanding” Community Reinvestment
Act (CRA) rating for our 2018-2020 CRA Strategic Plan. We released a
2021-2023 CRA Strategic Plan, and then replaced it with our new 2022-
2024 CRA Strategic Plan following the completion of our acquisition of
Boston Private Bank and Trust Company. The plan covers new and expanded
assessment areas: San Francisco Bay Area Assessment Area, Greater
Los Angeles Assessment Area and Greater Boston Assessment Area.
The CRA requires the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
and the other federal bank regulatory agencies to encourage banks to
help meet the credit needs of the entire community in which they conduct
business while also operating in a nancially safe and sound manner.
For more information on our new plan, please see our Community
Reinvestment Act Strategic Plan: 2022-2024.
Affordable Housing

Affordable housing is essential for healthy communities. The rapid escalation
of housing costs makes solving the affordability crisis in urban areas a critical
issue. This is particularly true for several cities where SVB operates, notably
the three assessment areas covered in our new CRA Strategic Plan, where
access to affordable housing for low- and moderate-income families is a
top priority. SVB is a longtime nancier of affordable housing through an
assortment of loans and investments, including supporting projects eligible
for Low-Income Housing Tax Credits and providing grants and loans to
affordable housing providers.
Between 2002 and 2021, SVB’s Community Development Finance
division has committed approximately $1.1 billion in investments and almost
$1.6 billion in loans to help build or rehabilitate close to 10,000 affordable
housing units in the San Francisco Bay Area. These homes are designed for
low- and moderate-income seniors, veterans, working families, people with
disabilities and those who are chronically homeless. As SVB continues to
grow, we look forward to continuing to support affordable housing.
Our place and success in

the innovation economy

have fueled our expanding

and increasing community

development programs

that help the most

vulnerable populations

in our communities

access safe and

affordable housing.

Expanding Our Impact

We consider it our responsibility to give back by investing in people
and organizations that promote strong communities. Our multipronged
approach engages SVB employees, clients and community partners to
more effectively address community needs. In recent years, we have
invited our clients, partners and networks to participate in fundraising
and volunteer opportunities, thereby increasing our overall impact.
We also support our employees who actively engage with charitable
organizations by donating their time, expertise or funds. Many employees
participate in SVB in the Community programs that fund various activities and

Special Programs

Tech Gives Back

Tech Gives Back (TGB) is an annual week of community
service hosted by SVB that engages our employees,
clients and partners around the world to give back to
the communities where they live and work. In 2021, we
virtually celebrated TGB by offering global volunteer
and fundraising opportunities with a diverse collection
of nonprots and our employees and clients completed
more than 700 volunteer hours.
Pledge 1%

We surpassed our annual goal of giving 1% of our net
income to charitable causes in 2021 by donating
approximately $18 million via our various philanthropic
programs. We also aspire to donate 1% of FTE time for
volunteering and introduced a new benet to provide
one volunteer day to each employee annually.
In order to leverage the success of the innovation economy
for the greater good, we donate to Founders’ Pledge,
which helps turn innovation economy success into
contributions for the greater good.
Beginning in 2022, we will fund some of our charitable
giving with a portion of income SVB gains from warrants
when certain corporate clients are acquired or go public.
Employee Matching

SVB’s Matching Program supports employees’ personal
philanthropy by matching their individual donations to
eligible nonprot organizations. Each calendar year, every
employee has a total of $2,000 in matching funds available
in addition to up to $1,000 in Volunteer Rewards, based
on $25 per hour of volunteer time, that can be donated
to a nonprot organization. SVB employees may also
make grant requests to the SVB Foundation. Grants
are considered for nonprot organizations where SVB
employees volunteer.

Unfair, Deceptive, or Abusive Acts

or Practices Policy

Our Unfair, Deceptive, or Abusive Acts or Practices
Policy (UDAAP), a framework we use to meet regulatory
expectations, guides our approach to ethical sales practices.
We train employees annually to ensure that our team
members have the awareness, skills and knowledge to
perform activities in a manner that supports compliance
with UDAAP standards and requirements.
Fair Lending

SVB is committed to a policy and practice of fair lending.
To that end, we take responsibility for treating clients
fairly and consistently based on their nancial standing in
accordance with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the
Fair Housing Act and other applicable state and local
laws. Our compliance with these principles and consumer
protections and policies is supported by our Compliance
and Fair Lending Programs, which are regularly examined by
the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, the Consumer
Financial Protection Bureau and the California Department
of Financial Protection and Innovation.
Wealth Advisory Practices

SVB offers wealth advisory services to complement our
private banking offerings. Our Registered Investment
Adviser (RIA) business, which is regulated and examined
by the US Securities and Exchange Commission,
delivers those services and has a duciary responsibility
to provide independent, unbiased advice that is in
the best interests of our clients and helps them
achieve their goals. The RIA business:
Sells advice, not products
Has an open-source platform to give clients
a wide range of investment options
Focuses on client outcomes, not commissions
Through SVB Private, our wealth advisory team provides
holistic advice that goes beyond an investment portfolio
and aims to consider all aspects of our clients’ nancial lives.
Client Feedback

Listening to client feedback is critical to our success
and is a practice in which we invest to ensure that we are
able to fulll our mission to help increase the probability
of our clients’ success.
We have a sophisticated Voice of the Customer program
that systematically monitors client sentiment and clients’
perceptions of SVB. It provides input and feedback that
help us learn about and improve on the experience we
offer our clients when they work with us.
The program comprises two main types of studies:

The relationship study gives an opportunity to
every client in our Commercial Bank and our Private
Bank to give us quantitative satisfaction scores and
provide feedback on our strengths and opportunities
for improvement. This data collection is performed
throughout the year on a continuous basis. We use
the feedback from this study to prioritize investments
that improve the client experience, including
the development of new products and services.
Additionally, we have a “close the loop” practice,
where our Relationship Managers reach out to clients
who are dissatised with SVB, attempting to resolve
any outstanding client issues.
Touch-point studies monitor client feedback at specic
points of interaction, for example, when contacting
our service center or transacting online. The feedback
we collect from these studies is used to continuously
improve the products and services we provide.
This program, together with ad hoc client research
and a strong client-centric culture, ensures that SVB is
continuously improving our clients’ experience, which is
one of our top strategic priorities across the enterprise.

Cybersecurity and Privacy

SVB is committed to respecting the right to data security
and privacy. Maintaining the condentiality, integrity and
availability of our Information Systems is critical for the
successful operation of the business, and is necessary to
provide reliable communications and data exchange within
the organization and to clients, business partners, vendors
and service providers. We are committed to protecting
and enhancing the security and privacy of our systems,
networks and general technology environment. We aim to
create a high level of awareness of security and privacy
best practices among all employees through consistent
communication and annual training.
Cybersecurity

The Board of Directors is actively engaged in oversight
of our cybersecurity practices. Our recently formed
Technology Committee has primary oversight of the overall
role of technology in executing the corporate strategy,
our signicant technology investments and programs,
and our technology and operational performance. The
Technology Committee receives management updates
on at least a quarterly basis and in coordination with the
Risk Committee, and oversees operational risk exposures
related to technology, including cybersecurity risks,
information security, fraud, data protection and privacy,
and business continuity and resilience, among other topics.
The Technology Committee also reviews and approves,
as necessary and appropriate, the company’s policies
related to cybersecurity, information security and data
privacy risk management.
We conduct annual third-party security assessments to
assess our controls, governance and preparedness for
cybersecurity threats. Additionally, the Cybersecurity Oce
reviews and updates relevant security policies annually to
ensure they are aligned with industry best practices and all
relevant laws and regulations. Continually strengthening and
testing our security preparedness allows us to better partner
with our clients and stakeholders in the innovation economy.
Privacy

A top priority for SVB is maintaining the trust our clients
and employees have in our data practices. We strive to
continually demonstrate SVB’s commitment to global
privacy compliance and the highest ethical standards
related to the collection, use, sharing and retention of
personal information.
As a global rm, we are taking a global approach to privacy
protection for our clients and employees. In all jurisdictions
where we operate, we aim to go beyond regulatory
compliance by providing our clients and employees rights
and control over their personal data. Under the direction
of our Chief Privacy Ocer, we design our products and
services according to the principle of Privacy by Design,
ensuring ethical and compliant data collection, use, sharing
and retention practices through technologies that focus
on embedding privacy protections from the start.
SVB continues to make investments in our Global Privacy
Oce by focusing on key functions surrounding privacy
operations, privacy engineering and privacy governance.
A multiyear strategy has been developed with detailed
Objectives and Key Results, which will help ensure we
can measure our progress across privacy pillars such as
transparency, choice, data collection, appropriate use
and sharing, international transfer, incident management
and accountability.

SVB is committed to providing investors and other stakeholders with meaningful data on our
environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance, underscoring our long-standing pledge
of transparency and accountability. We aim to enable relevant comparisons of our ESG performance
with peer companies. This is our second disclosure in accordance with SASB. We are using SASB’s
Commercial Bank Standards, Version 2018-10, which are most applicable to our core operations.
Unless otherwise specied, the data and descriptions are current as of year-end 2021.
There are two key contextual issues to take into account when reviewing our SASB disclosure.
First, our client base includes startups, some of which are considered small businesses under
Small Business Administration guidelines. Small business lending is at the core of SVB’s business
strategy, but the denition of “small business” varies. For Financial Inclusion and Capacity Building
metrics, we use the US Community Reinvestment Act denition of small business, which covers
businesses with less than $1 million in gross annual revenues.

Forward-Looking Statements

This Annual Report on Form 10-K, including in particular <Management9s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations= under Part II,
Item 7 of this report, contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In
addition, management has in the past and may in the future make forward-looking statements to analysts, investors, representatives of the media and others.
Forward-looking statements are statements that are not historical facts and represent only our beliefs regarding future events. Broadly speaking, forward-looking
statements include, but are not limited to, the following:

" Financial projections, including with respect to our NII, noninterest income, EPS, noninterest expenses (including professional services, compliance,
compensation and other costs), cash flows, balance sheet positions, capital expenditures, deposit growth, liquidity and capitalization or other financial
items;
" Descriptions of our strategic initiatives, plans or objectives for future operations, including pending sales or acquisitions;
" Forecasts of private equity and venture capital funding and investment levels;
" Forecasts of future interest rates, economic performance, and income from investments;
" Forecasts of expected levels of provisions for loan losses, loan growth, loan mix, loan yields and client funds;
" The outlook on our clients' performance;
" The potential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic; and
" Descriptions of assumptions underlying or relating to any of the foregoing.
You can identify these and other forward-looking statements by the use of words such as <becoming,= <may,= <will,= <should,= <could,= <would,= <predict,=
<potential,= <continue,= <anticipate,= <believe,= <estimate,= <assume,= <seek,= <expect,= <plan,= <intend,= and the negative of such words or comparable terminology.
Forward-looking statements are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance.

Although we believe that the expectations reflected in our forward-looking statements are reasonable, we have based these expectations on our current beliefs
as well as our assumptions, and such expectations may not prove to be correct. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent
uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside our control. Our actual results of operations and financial
performance could differ significantly from those expressed in or implied by our management9s forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our
actual results and financial condition to differ from the expectations stated in the forward-looking statements include, among others:

" Market and economic conditions (including inflation trends, interest rate volatility, the general condition of the capital and equity markets, and IPO,
secondary offering, SPAC fundraising, M&A and financing activity levels) and the associated impact on us (including effects on client demand for our
commercial and investment banking and other financial services, as well as on the valuations of our investments);
" Disruptions to the financial markets as a result of the current or anticipated impact of military conflict, including escalating military tension between
Russia and Ukraine, terrorism or other geopolitical events;
" The COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on the economic and business environments in which we operate, and its effect on our operations;
" The impact of changes from the Biden-Harris Administration and the U.S. Congress on the economic environment, capital markets and regulatory
landscape, including monetary, tax and other trade policies, as well as changes in personnel at the bank regulatory agencies;
" Changes in the volume and credit quality of our loans as well as volatility of our levels of nonperforming assets and charge-offs;
" The impact of changes in interest rates or market levels or factors affecting or affected by them, especially on our loan and investment portfolios;
" The adequacy of our ACL and the need to make provisions for credit losses for any period;
" The sufficiency of our capital and liquidity provisions;
" Changes in the levels of our loans, deposits and client investment fund balances;
" Changes in the performance or equity valuations of funds or companies in which we have invested or hold derivative instruments or equity warrant
assets;
" Variations from our expectations as to factors impacting our cost structure;
" Changes in our assessment of the creditworthiness or liquidity of our clients or unanticipated effects of credit concentration risks which create or
exacerbate deterioration of such creditworthiness or liquidity;
" Variations from our expectations as to factors impacting the timing and level of employee share-based transactions;
" The occurrence of fraudulent activity, including breaches of our information security or cyber security-related incidents;
4
Table of Contents

" Business disruptions and interruptions due to natural disasters and other external events;
" The impact on our reputation and business from our interactions with business partners, counterparties, service providers and other third parties;
" The expansion of our business internationally, and the impact of international market and economic events on us;
" The effectiveness of our risk management framework and quantitative models;
" The impact of governmental policy, legal requirements and regulations including regulations promulgated by the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve"), and other regulatory requirements;
" Our ability to maintain or increase our market share, including through successfully implementing our business strategy and undertaking new business
initiatives, including through the integration of Boston Private and expansion of our private banking business and the growth and expansion of SVB
Securities, including entry into the technology investment banking sector;
" Greater than expected costs or other difficulties related to the integration of our business and that of Boston Private;
" Variations from our expectations as to the amount and timing of business opportunities, growth prospects and cost savings associated with completing
the acquisition of Boston Private;
" The inability to retain existing Boston Private clients and employees following the closing of the Boston Private acquisition;
" Unfavorable resolution of legal proceedings or claims, as well as legal or regulatory proceedings or governmental actions;
" Variations from our expectations as to factors impacting our estimate of our full-year effective tax rate;
" Changes in applicable accounting standards and tax laws;
" Regulatory or legal changes or their impact on us; and
" Other factors as discussed in <Risk Factors= under Part I, Item 1A of this report.
The operating and economic environment has continued to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has created major economic and financial
disruptions that have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, certain of our business, operations, financial performance and prospects. Even after
the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, it is possible that the U.S. and other major economies will experience a prolonged recession, which could materially and adversely
affect our business, operations, financial performance and prospects. Statements about the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, operations, financial
performance and prospects may constitute forward-looking statements and are subject to the risk that the actual impacts may differ, possibly materially, from what is
reflected in those forward-looking statements due to factors and future developments that are uncertain, unpredictable and in many cases beyond our control,
including the scope and duration of the pandemic, potential variants of the virus (including the emergence of the Omicron variant), vaccination rates, the need for
vaccine booster shots, actions taken by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic, and the direct and indirect impact of the pandemic on our customers,
third parties and us.

Accordingly, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. We urge investors to consider all of these factors, among others,
carefully in evaluating the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. All subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements
attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements. The forward-looking statements included in
this filing are made only as of the date of this filing. We assume no obligation and do not intend to revise or update any forward-looking statements contained in this
Annual Report on Form 10-K, except as required by law.

Table of Contents

NII accounts for the major portion of our earnings. It is comprised primarily of income generated from interest rate spread differences between the interest
rates received on interest-earning assets, such as loans extended to clients and securities held in our fixed income securities portfolio, and the interest rates paid by us
on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Our deposits are largely obtained from commercial clients within our technology, life
science/healthcare and private equity/venture capital industry sectors. We also obtain deposits from the premium wine industry commercial clients and from our SVB
Private Bank clients. Other than our Private Bank clients, we do not obtain deposits from retail or consumer banking sources.

Noninterest income is primarily income generated from our fee-based services and gains on our investments and derivative securities. We offer a wide range of
fee-based financial services to our clients, including global commercial banking, private banking and other business services. We generally refer to revenues generated
by such fee-based services as our "core fee income," (a non-GAAP measure) which is comprised of our client investment fees, wealth management and trust fees,
foreign exchange fees, credit card fees, deposit service charges, lending related fees and letters of credit and standby letters of credit fees. In addition, through SVB
Securities, we offer investment banking, M&A advisory services and equity research capabilities as mentioned above. We generally refer to our core fee income plus
revenues generated by these investment banking services and commissions from sales and trading activities as <core fee income plus SVB Securities revenue.= We
believe our ability to integrate and cross-sell our diverse financial services to our clients is a strength of our business model. Additionally, we hold AFS, HTM, non-
marketable and marketable investment securities. Subject to applicable regulatory requirements, we manage and invest in private equity/venture capital funds that
invest directly in privately-held companies, as well as funds that invest in other private equity/venture capital funds. Gains on these investments are reported in our
consolidated statements of income and include noncontrolling interests. We also recognize gains from warrants to acquire stock in client companies, which we obtain
in connection with negotiating credit facilities and certain other services. See <Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-
Noninterest Income-Gains on Investment Securities, Net= and "Gains on Equity Warrant Assets, Net" under Part II, Item 7 of this report.

We derive substantially all of our revenue from U.S. clients. We derived less than 10 percent of our total revenues from foreign clients for each of 2021, 2020
and 2019.

Client Industries

We provide products and services to serve the needs of our clients in each of the industries described below. We serve our commercial company clients
throughout their life cycles, beginning with the "emerging" or "early-stage" and progressing through later stages as their needs mature and expand, primarily in the
technology and life science/healthcare industries. We also serve other targeted client industries --- private equity and venture capital firms, premium wine and private
banking/wealth management.

Technology and Life Science/Healthcare

We serve a variety of clients in the technology and life science/healthcare industries. Our technology clients tend to be in the industries of frontier tech and
hardware (such as semiconductors, communications, data, storage and electronics); enterprise and consumer software/internet (such as infrastructure software,
applications, software services, digital content and advertising technology); fintech; and climate technology and sustainability. Our life science/healthcare clients
primarily tend to be in the industries of biopharma, healthtech, medical devices, healthcare services and diagnostics and tools. A key component of our technology
and life science/healthcare business strategy is to develop relationships with clients at an early stage and offer them banking services that will continue to meet their
needs as they mature and expand. We serve these clients primarily through three practices:

" Our SVB Accelerator practice focuses on serving our <emerging= or <early-stage= clients. These clients are generally privately-held companies in the start-up
or early stages of their life cycles and funded by friends and family, <seed= or <angel= investors or have gone through an initial round of venture capital
financing. They are typically engaged primarily in research and development activities and may have brought only a few products or services to market, if any.
SVB Accelerator clients tend to have annual revenues below $5 million, and many are pre-revenue companies.
" Our SVB Growth practice serves our <mid-stage= and <later-stage= clients. These clients are generally privately-held companies in the intermediate or later
stages of their life cycles, and are often dependent on venture capital for funding. However, some of these clients are in the more advanced stages of their
life cycles and may be publicly-held or poised to become publicly-held. Our SVB Growth clients generally have a more established product or service offering
in the market and may be in a period of expansion. SVB Growth clients tend to have annual revenues between $5 million and $75 million.
" Our SVB Corporate Finance practice primarily serves our large corporate clients, which are more mature and established companies. These clients are
generally publicly-held or large privately-held companies and have a more

sophisticated product or service offering in the market. SVB Corporate Finance clients tend to have annual revenues over $75 million.
In addition, our Sponsored Finance group provides debt financing in support of private equity sponsored company acquisitions, primarily technology and life
science/healthcare companies.

Global Fund Banking

We serve clients in the private equity/venture capital community, many of whom are investors in the portfolio company clients to whom we provide banking
services. In particular, we provide credit facilities to our private equity/venture capital clients, including capital call lines of credit, the repayment of which is
dependent on the payment of capital calls or management fees by the underlying limited partner investors in the funds managed by the firms.

Since our founding, we have cultivated strong relationships within the venture capital community, which has over time expanded to relationships within the
private equity community. We believe our network helps to facilitate deal flow opportunities between these private equity/venture capital firms and the companies
within the markets we serve.

Premium Wine

We are one of the leading providers of financial services to premium wine producers across the western United States, primarily in California9s Napa Valley,
Sonoma County and Central Coast regions, as well as the Pacific Northwest. We focus on vineyards and wineries that produce grapes and premium wines.

Private Bank/Wealth Management

We provide private banking and wealth management services to consumer clients, including private equity/venture capital professionals and executive leaders
of the innovation companies they support. We offer private banking, cash management and wealth management services to meet their personal banking and financial
needs.

Competition

The banking and financial services industry is highly competitive and continues to evolve as a result of changes in regulation, technology, product delivery
systems and the general market and economic climate. Our competitors include other banks, debt funds, specialty and diversified financial services intermediaries and
other <Fintech= disruptors that offer lending, leasing, payments, investment, foreign currency exchange, advisory and other financial products and services to our
target client base. For example, we compete with alternative lenders, such as <marketplace= lenders, peer-to-peer lenders and other non-traditional lenders that have
emerged in recent years. We also compete with non-financial service providers, particularly payment facilitators and processors, as well as other nonbanking
technology providers in the payments industry which may offer specialized services to our client base. In addition, we compete with hedge funds and private equity
funds, as well as investment banks. The principal competitive factors in our markets include product offerings, service, pricing and transaction size and structure. Given
our established market position within the client segments that we serve, our continued efforts to develop products and services, and our ability to integrate and
cross-sell our diverse financial services to extend the length of our relationships with our clients, we believe we compete favorably in the markets in our core business
areas.

Human Capital

SVB Financial Group9s success is dependent on our ability to retain, attract and motivate qualified employees. We rely on our personnel, which includes a
substantial number of employees who have technical or other expertise and/or a strong network of relationships with individuals and institutions in the markets we
serve. Competition for skilled and qualified personnel in financial services, technology and innovation is significant in the markets in which we operate. As part of our
effort to retain, attract and motivate employees, we strive to offer competitive compensation and benefits, promote diversity, equity and inclusion, support the safety
and well-being of our employees, encourage our employees to give back to their communities and lead with our corporate values. Through these efforts, we strive to
foster a workplace and environment that empower our employees to be successful.

As of December 31, 2021, we employed 6,567 FTEs. Approximately 80 percent of our employees are in the United states and approximately 20 percent are in
international locations, including the U.K., Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Israel, China, Hong Kong, India and Canada. Our overall employee count increased by
approximately 47 percent in 2021, including growth from acquisitions, increases in our investment banking business, as well as additions across all three lines of
defense.

During 2021, we continued to focus on the response to the ongoing and evolving COVID-19 pandemic. As described further under <Management9s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 3 Management9s Overview of 2021 Financial Performance 3 Recent Developments 3 COVID-19=, we
continued to focus on the safety, well-being and stability of our people, and providing support for our employees, including expanded support to those directly
impacted by COVID-19, mental health and wellness support, and other work-from-home support such as utility stipends and technology and equipment. We
encourage you to visit our website under < About US 3 Living Our Values ,= for more detailed

information regarding our environmental, social and governance related programs and initiatives, as well as additional details regarding our human capital
management. The contents of our website are not incorporated herein by reference and the website address provided is intended to be an inactive textual reference
only.

Compensation and Benefits. In order to retain and attract talent, we provide employees with competitive compensation and benefits packages. Our compensation and
benefits program provides both short-term and long-term awards, incentivizing performance and aligning employee and shareholder interests. Employee
compensation packages include a competitive base salary and, subject to Company and individual performance, may include an annual incentive cash bonus.
Employees at certain levels are eligible to receive equity awards tied to the value of the Company9s stock. Other employee benefits include health insurance (medical,
dental and vision), parental bonding leave, a 401(k) plan with matching employee contributions, an employee stock purchase plan, an EHOP that offers mortgages on
primary homes, paid time off, life insurance, disability insurance, wellness programs (including webinars as well as individual wellness counseling) and learning
opportunities.

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (<DEI=). We believe that advancing diversity, equity and inclusion produces better results for our clients and is crucial to attracting and
retaining skilled personnel. We embrace pathways to increase diversity and achieve gender parity in our senior leadership. Our multi-pronged approach to promoting
a diverse and inclusive workplace includes employee awareness programs and Employee Resource Groups, internal DEI-focused <town hall= meetings, regular training
and educational opportunities, fair pay analysis, leadership development, hiring outreach programs and strategic partnerships to advance diversity objectives.

Safety and Well-Being. The safety and well-being of our employees is of paramount importance. We have developed and maintain company procedures and practices
to ensure the safety of our employees in the different markets we operate. During 2021, we focused on providing employee support to address work, life, financial
and health-related issues. This included new programs and benefits to ease work-from-home challenges and address the medical and other support needs of those
directly impacted by COVID-19. We are also committed to maintaining a work environment that is free of harassment or discriminatory practices. We have processes
and escalation channels for employees to report harassment, discrimination or other concerns. In addition, we regularly seek feedback from employees through
engagement surveys to help evaluate whether employees are satisfied and engaged in their job positions, as well as understand and are aligned with our business
objectives and values.

Community. We are committed to giving back to the communities in which our employees live and work and believe these efforts help us retain and attract talent. We
match certain employee charitable donations to eligible non-profits. We also encourage employee volunteering. Our non-profit charitable SVB Foundation also
contributes to community organizations and other causes. We also invest in affordable housing projects in the communities in which we live and work as well as
provide financial support to low- and moderate-income communities in California and Massachusetts. In addition, we have a university scholarship program that funds
certain scholarships and internships.

Company Values. Our Company values guide our actions and empower our employees to be successful. Our core values are: start with empathy for others; take
responsibility; embrace diverse perspectives; speak and act with integrity; and keep learning and improving. We believe that our values are key to attracting, retaining,
and inspiring our employees and contribute to the success of both our business and the innovation economy more generally.

Supervision and Regulation

Our bank and bank holding company operations are subject to extensive regulation by federal and state regulatory agencies. This regulation is intended primarily
for the stability of the U.S. banking system as well as the protection of depositors and the Deposit Insurance Fund (the <DIF=). This regulation is not intended for the
benefit of our security holders.

As a bank holding company that has elected financial holding company (<FHC=) status, SVB Financial is subject to primary regulation, supervision, and examination
by the Federal Reserve under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the <BHC Act=). The Bank, as a California state-chartered bank and a member of
the Federal Reserve System, is subject to primary supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve as well as the DFPI. In addition, the Bank must comply with
certain requirements of the FDIC as, to the extent provided by law, the Bank9s deposits are insured by the FDIC. Our consumer banking activities also are subject to
regulation and supervision by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the <CFPB=).

SVB Financial and certain of its non-bank subsidiaries are also subject to regulation by the SEC and FINRA as well as certain other federal and state regulatory
agencies. In addition, we are subject to regulation by certain foreign regulatory agencies in international jurisdictions where we conduct, or may in the future wish to
conduct, business, including the U.K., Germany, Israel, China, Hong Kong and Canada. (See <International Regulation= below.)

The following discussion of statutes and regulations is a summary and does not purport to be complete. This discussion is qualified in its entirety by reference to
the statutes and regulations referred to in this discussion. Regulators, the U.S. Congress, state legislatures and international consultative and standard-setting bodies
continue to enact rules, laws and

policies to regulate the financial services industry and public companies in an effort to protect consumers and investors, and may have differing interpretations in the
implementation of such rules. Actions by the U.S. Congress and the Biden-Harris Administration, as well as related changes in key personnel at regulatory agencies,
could result in changes in regulations applicable to us and how they are interpreted. As a result, the precise nature of laws and regulations relevant to our activities
and the effect of government policies on the Company9s business cannot be predicted and, in some cases, may have a material and adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, and/or results of operations. For more information, see <Risk Factors-Legal and Regulatory Risks= under Part I, Item IA of this report.

Regulation and Supervision of SVB Financial and Silicon Valley Bank

As a financial holding company, SVB Financial generally may engage in certain otherwise prohibited non-banking activities and activities that the Federal Reserve
has determined to be <financial in nature= or incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature, including certain securities, merchant banking and
insurance activities.

In order to retain FHC status, a financial holding company and all of its depository institution subsidiaries must be well-capitalized and well-managed, pursuant to
the Federal Reserve9s Regulation Y. Otherwise, SVB Financial could face material restrictions on its activities and its ability to enter into certain transactions. In
addition, if the Bank has not received at least a satisfactory rating on its most recent examination under the CRA, we would not be able to commence any new
financial activities or acquire a company that engages in such activities. In that case, we would still be allowed to engage in activities closely related to banking and
make investments in the ordinary course of conducting banking activities. The Bank continues to be in at least satisfactory compliance with the CRA and in 2021 it
received its first "outstanding" rating on its CRA strategic plan.

Pursuant to applicable California and federal law, state-chartered commercial banks are permitted to engage in any activity permissible for national banks, which
includes the many so-called <closely related to banking= or <non-banking= activities commonly conducted by national banks. In addition, the Bank may conduct,
through a subsidiary, certain <financial= activities that would be impermissible for the Bank itself to conduct, provided the Bank remains <well-capitalized,= <well-
managed= and in satisfactory compliance with the CRA.

Bank holding companies and insured banks are subject to potential enforcement actions of varying levels of severity by federal and state regulators and law
enforcement authorities for unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their business or for violations of law, regulation or condition imposed in writing by any
applicable agency or term of a written agreement with that agency.

Enhanced Prudential Standards

In October 2019, the federal banking agencies issued rules that tailor the application of enhanced prudential standards to large bank holding companies and the
capital and liquidity rules to large bank holding companies and depository institutions (the <Tailoring Rules=) to implement amendments to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street
Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the <Dodd-Frank Act=) under the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (the <EGRRCPA=). Under
the EGRRCPA, the threshold above which the Federal Reserve is required to apply enhanced prudential standards to bank holding companies increased from $50
billion in average total consolidated assets to $250 billion. The Federal Reserve may also impose enhanced prudential standards on bank holding companies with
between $100 billion and $250 billion in average total consolidated assets.

Under the Tailoring Rules, banking organizations are grouped into four categories based on their U.S. G-SIB status, size and four other risk-based indicators. The
most stringent standards apply to U.S. G-SIBs, which represent Category I, and the least stringent standards apply to Category IV organizations, which have between
$100 billion and $250 billion in average total consolidated assets and less than $75 billion in certain other risk-based indicators. Category IV firms are, among other
things, subject to (1) certain liquidity risk management and risk committee requirements, including liquidity buffer and liquidity stress testing requirements; (2)
requirements to develop and maintain a capital plan on an annual basis; and (3) supervisory capital stress testing on a biennial basis. As of June 30, 2021, SVB Financial
passed the threshold to be considered a Category IV institution, and accordingly, is subject to requirements applicable to Category IV institutions.

If a Category IV organization exceeds either (i) $250 billion in average total consolidated assets or (ii) $100 billion or more in average total consolidated assets and
at least $75 billion in nonbank assets, weighted short-term wholesale funding (as defined by the Federal Reserve) (<WSTWF=) or off-balance sheet exposures, it will
become a Category III organization, and will, subject to a transition period, be subject to additional heightened requirements.

Several of the enhanced prudential standards for Category IV and Category III firms are summarized below:
" Risk Management. Category IV and Category III organizations are subject to risk committee and risk management requirements, as well as liquidity risk
management, liquidity buffer and liquidity stress testing requirements.
11
Table of Contents

" Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (<CCAR=). Category IV and Category III organizations are required to submit an annual capital plan to the Federal
Reserve. The Federal Reserve9s capital plan rule provides firms subject to Category IV standards additional flexibility to develop their capital plans. For firms
subject to CCAR, failure to submit a satisfactory plan can result in restrictions on capital distributions, including dividends and common stock repurchases.
The CCAR process is intended to help ensure that BHCs have robust, forward-looking capital planning processes that account for each company9s unique risks
and that permit continued operations during times of economic and financial stress.
" Stress Testing. Category IV organizations, like SVBFG, are subject to supervisory stress tests conducted by the Federal Reserve every other year. Category III
organizations are subject to annual supervisory stress tests and must conduct company-run stress tests every other year (commonly referred to as Dodd-
Frank Stress Tests or <DFAST=). These stress tests are used to determine whether the firms have sufficient capital on a consolidated basis necessary to absorb
losses in baseline and severely adverse economic conditions.
" Resolution Planning. Category III firms, but not Category IV firms, are required to submit to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC a plan for rapid and orderly
resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure. Separately, FDIC regulations require insured depository institutions (<IDIs=) with average total
consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, such as the Bank, to submit a resolution plan with respect to the bank. In June 2021, the FDIC issued a Statement
of Resolution Plans for Insured Depository Institutions, which, among other things, provided further details surrounding streamlined content requirements
for IDI plan submissions, and established a three-year filing cycle for banks with $100 billion or more in assets. As a result, the Bank will submit a resolution
plan on a three-year cycle beginning in 2022. Prior to each IDI plan submission, the FDIC will send a written communication to the Bank specifying the timing
of its submission, which will be required no earlier than 12 months after the date of the communication, and which the FDIC expects will be required by the
first business day in December of an applicable year. The Bank expects to submit its resolution plan by December 2022.
" Liquidity Requirements. Category IV institutions with greater than $50 billion in WSTWF, as well as Category I-III organizations, are subject to LCR and net
stable funding ratio (<NSFR=) requirements and must maintain high-quality liquid assets in accordance with specific quantitative requirements. However, the
above-mentioned Category IV institutions, as well as Category III institutions with less than $75 billion in WSTWF, are subject to reduced LCR and NSFR
requirements. Category III institutions with greater than $75 billion in WSTWF and all Category I-II organizations are subject to the full LCR and NSFR
requirements. As of December 31, 2021, we have less than $50 billion in WSTWF, therefore, we are currently not subject to LCR and NSFR requirements.
" Single counterparty credit limit. In June 2018, the Federal Reserve issued a final rule regarding single-counterparty credit limits (<SCCL=) for large banking
organizations, excluding Category IV firms, subjecting them to a limit of 25% of Tier 1 capital for aggregate net credit exposures to any other unaffiliated
counterparty. Given SVB Financial is a Category IV firm, we are not subject to the SCCL requirements.
Regulatory Capital

U.S. banking organizations are subject to a comprehensive capital framework (the <Capital Rules=), issued by the federal banking agencies, which implement the
Basel III regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. <Basel III= refers to the internationally agreed regulatory capital framework adopted
by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the <Basel Committee=).

The Capital Rules establish minimum risk-weighted capital ratios for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital as well as a minimum "leverage ratio" of Tier 1
capital to total consolidated average tangible assets (as defined for regulatory purposes). CET1 is defined as common stock, plus related surplus, and retained earnings
plus minority interest in the form of common stock, subject to a limit, less certain regulatory deductions and adjustments. For most banking organizations, the most
common form of Tier 1 capital (other than CET1) is noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and the most common form of Tier 2 capital is subordinated debt and a
portion of the allowance for loan and lease losses, in each case, subject to certain requirements. Total capital consists of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital.

Under the Capital Rules, the minimum capital ratios applicable to SVB Financial and the Bank are as follows: 4.5% CET1 capital, 6.0% Tier 1 capital, 8.0% Total
capital and 4.0% Tier 1 leverage. In addition, banking organizations must meet a 2.5% CET1 risk-based capital conservation buffer requirement in order to avoid
constraints on capital distributions, such as dividends and equity repurchases, and certain bonus compensation for executive officers. The severity of the constraints
would depend on the amount of the shortfall and the banking organization9s <eligible retained income= (that is, the greater of (i) the preceding four-quarter net
income, net of distributions and tax effects not reflected in net income and (ii) the average quarterly net income from the preceding four quarters). In March 2020, for
BHCs with $100 billion or more in assets, such as SVB Financial, the Federal Reserve approved a final rule replacing the static 2.5% component of the capital
conservation buffer with a firm-specific stress capital buffer (<SCB=) requirement, reflecting stressed losses in the supervisory severely

adverse scenario of the Federal Reserve9s CCAR stress tests and including four quarters of planned common stock dividends, subject to a minimum 2.5% floor. During a
year in which a Category IV firm, such as SVB Financial, does not undergo a supervisory stress test, the firm will receive an updated SCB that reflects the firm9s updated
planned common stock dividends. A Category IV firm may also elect to participate in the supervisory stress test in a year in which the firm would not normally be
subject to the supervisory stress test to receive an updated SCB.

If SVB Financial were to become a Category III firm, it would also be subject to (i) if deployed by the Federal Reserve, up to an additional 2.5% CET1 countercyclical
capital buffer and (ii) a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of 3.0% that takes into account both on-balance sheet and certain off-balance sheet exposures.

The regulatory capital ratios of SVB Financial and the Bank currently exceed these levels, as shown in the following chart:
December 31, 2021 SVB Financial Bank Required Ratio (1)
CET1 risk-based capital 12.09% 14.89% 7.0%
Tier 1 risk-based capital 16.08 14.89 8.5
Total risk-based capital 16.58 15.40 10.5
Tier 1 leverage 7.93 7.24 4.0

(1) Percentages represent the minimum capital ratios plus, as applicable, the 2.5% CET1 capital conservation buffer under the Capital Rules.

The regulatory capital ratios of SVB Financial and the Bank also exceed the <well-capitalized= requirements under the Capital Rules. Refer to Note 234<Regulatory
Matters= of the <Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements= under Part II, Item 8 of this report for more information.

In December 2017, the Basel Committee published standards to revise the Basel Committee9s standardized approach for credit risk (including recalibrating risk
weights and introducing new capital requirements for certain <unconditionally cancellable commitments=) and establish a new standardized approach for operational
risk capital. Under the current Capital Rules, operational risk capital requirements do not apply to non-advanced approaches banking organizations, such as SVB
Financial and the Bank. The federal banking agencies have not yet implemented these revised standards, and their impact on SVB Financial and the Bank will depend
on the manner in which they are implemented.

In light of the economic disruptions and operational challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic, in 2020 the federal banking agencies adopted a rule that
provided relief to banking organizations with respect to the impact of CECL on regulatory capital (the <2020 CECL Transition Rule=). Under the 2020 CECL Transition
Rule, banking organizations that adopted CECL during the 2020 calendar year, such as SVB Financial and the Bank, were permitted to delay the estimated impact of
CECL on regulatory capital until January 2022, followed by a three-year period to phase out the aggregate capital benefit provided during the initial two-year delay.
The rule prescribes a methodology for estimating the impact of differences in credit loss allowances reflected under CECL versus under the incurred loss methodology
during the five-year transition period. We elected to use the five-year transition option under the 2020 CECL Transition Rule.

Capital Planning

Banking organizations must have appropriate capital planning processes, with proper oversight from the Board of Directors. The Federal Reserve expects bank
holding companies, such as SVB Financial, to conduct and document comprehensive capital adequacy analyses prior to the declaration of any dividends (on common
stock, preferred stock, or other Tier 1 capital instruments), capital redemptions or capital repurchases. Moreover, the federal banking agencies view the adequacy and
effectiveness of a bank9s interest rate risk management process and the level of its interest rate exposures as critical factors in the evaluation of the bank9s capital
adequacy. A bank with material weaknesses in its interest rate risk management process or high levels of interest rate exposure relative to its capital will be directed
by the relevant federal banking agencies to take corrective actions.

As a Category IV firm, we are required to submit an annual capital plan to the Federal Reserve. A BHC9s planned capital distributions in its annual capital plan
submissions must be consistent with any effective distribution limitations that would apply under the firm9s own baseline projections, including its SCB. SVB Financial9s
ability to make capital distributions would likely be impacted in the event that SVB Financial fails to maintain its SCB above its minimum CET1 risk-based, Tier-1 risk-
based and total risk-based capital requirements. In addition, the Federal Reserve9s capital plan rule relating to the CCAR process also provides that a BHC must receive
prior approval for any dividend, stock repurchase, or other capital distribution, other than a capital distribution on a newly issued capital instrument, if the BHC is
required to resubmit its capital plan. Among other circumstances, a firm may be required to resubmit its capital plan in connection with certain acquisitions or
dispositions.

Proprietary Trading and Relationships with Certain Funds

The Volcker Rule, set out in section 13 of the BHC Act, restricts, among other things, bank holding companies and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary
trading and from sponsoring, investing in, or having certain other relationships with certain privately offered funds, including certain hedge funds and private equity
funds (<covered funds=). On June 6, 2017, we received notice that the Federal Reserve approved our application for an extension of the permitted conformance period
for our investments in certain <illiquid= covered funds ("Restricted Volcker Investments"). The approval extends the deadline by which the Company must sell, divest,
restructure or otherwise conform such Restricted Volcker Investments to the provisions of the Volcker Rule until the earlier of (i) July 21, 2022 and (ii) the date by
which each fund matures by its terms or is otherwise conformed to the Volcker Rule. These investments are comprised of interests attributable solely to the Company
in our consolidated managed funds and certain of our non-marketable securities.

In October 2019, the Volcker Rule implementing agencies, including the Federal Reserve (the <Agencies=), finalized rules amending the regulations implementing
the Volcker Rule (the "2019 Volcker Amendments"). These amendments tailor compliance requirements based on the size of a firm9s trading assets and liabilities and
eliminate or adjust certain requirements to clarify permitted and prohibited activities. The 2019 Volcker Amendments went into effect on January 1, 2020, and
became mandatory on January 1, 2021. Additionally, on June 25, 2020, the Agencies approved further amendments (the <2020 Volcker Amendments=) effective
October 1, 2020, which provide for, among other things, the adoption of new exclusions from the definition of <covered fund= for venture capital funds and credit
funds that meet certain criteria. As a result of these amendments, we believe that none of the Restricted Volcker Investments will be required to be disposed of or
otherwise conformed under the Volcker Rule requirements. We expect that all of our Restricted Volcker Investments will (i) qualify for these new exclusions; (ii)
otherwise be excluded from the definition of "covered fund"; or (iii) will have commenced or completed a liquidation or dissolution process.

Prompt Corrective Action

State and federal banking agencies possess broad powers to take corrective and other supervisory action against an insured bank and its holding company. For
example, an IDI is placed into one of five categories based on the level of its capital ratios: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly
undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. At each successive lower capital category, an IDI is subject to more restrictions and prohibitions, including restrictions
on growth, restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, restrictions or prohibitions on payment of dividends and restrictions on the acceptance of brokered
deposits. Based upon its capital levels, a bank that is classified as well-capitalized, adequately capitalized or undercapitalized may be treated as though it were in the
next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency, after notice and opportunity for hearing, determines that an unsafe or unsound condition or
practice warrants such treatment.

Restrictions on Dividends

Dividends from the Bank constitute one of the primary sources of cash for SVB Financial. The Bank is subject to various federal and state statutory and regulatory
restrictions on its ability to pay dividends, including applicable provisions of the California Financial Code and the federal prompt corrective action regulations. For
example, the Bank may not, without approval of the Federal Reserve, declare or pay a dividend to SVB Financial if the total of all dividends declared in a calendar year
exceeds the total of (a) the Bank9s net income for that year and (b) its retained net income for the preceding two calendar years, less any required transfers to
additional paid-in capital or to a fund for the retirement of preferred stock. In addition, the banking agencies have the authority to prohibit the Bank from paying
dividends, depending upon the Bank9s financial condition, if such payment is deemed to constitute an unsafe or unsound practice.

It is the Federal Reserve9s policy that bank holding companies should generally pay dividends on common stock only out of income available over the past year
and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization9s expected future needs and financial condition. It is also the Federal Reserve9s policy
that bank holding companies should not maintain dividend levels that undermine their ability to be a source of strength to their banking subsidiaries. Under the
prompt corrective action regulations, the Federal Reserve may prohibit a bank holding company from paying any dividends if the holding company9s bank subsidiary is
classified as <undercapitalized.=

Transactions with Affiliates

Transactions between the Bank and its operating subsidiaries (such as SVB Asset Management or SVB Wealth Advisory), on the one hand, and the Bank9s
affiliates (such as SVB Financial, SVB Securities or an entity affiliated with our SVB Capital business), on the other, are subject to statutory and regulatory restrictions
designed to limit the risks to the Bank and its subsidiaries, including Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and the Federal Reserve9s Regulation W. These
restrictions include quantitative and qualitative limits on the amounts and types of transactions with affiliates, including extensions of credit to affiliates, investments
in the stock or securities of affiliates, purchases of assets from affiliates and

14

certain other transactions with affiliates. In addition, credit transactions with affiliates must be collateralized, and transactions with affiliates must be on market terms
or better for the Bank.

Premiums for Deposit Insurance

The FDIC insures our customer deposits through the DIF up to prescribed limits for each depositor. The FDIC has established a reserve ratio of 2% as a long-term
goal, which goes beyond the statutorily mandated minimum of 1.35%, and may increase assessment rates in the future accordingly.

Consumer Regulations

The Bank is subject to many federal consumer protection statutes and regulations, such as the CRA, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (Regulation B), the
Electronic Fund Transfer Act (Regulation E), the Truth in Lending Act (Regulation Z), the National Flood Insurance Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act (as amended by the
Fair and Accurate Credit Transaction Act) and various federal and state privacy protection laws. The Bank and SVB Financial are also subject to federal and state laws
prohibiting unfair, deceptive, abusive, corrupt or fraudulent business practices, untrue or misleading advertising and unfair competition. As a depository institution
with more than $10 billion in total assets, the Bank is subject to examination by the CFPB. The CFPB9s mandate is to promulgate consumer regulations and ensure that
consumer financial practices at large banks, such as the Bank, comply with federal consumer financial protection requirements. The CFPB has broad enforcement
authority, including investigations, civil actions, cease and desist proceedings and the ability to refer criminal findings to the Department of Justice. Penalties for
violating these laws could include civil monetary penalties, remediation for affected consumers and reimbursements and orders to halt expansion or existing activities.

State and federal banking agencies and other such enforcement authorities have increased efforts to aggressively enforce consumer protection laws, implement
regulations and take action against non-compliant parties.

Privacy and Cybersecurity

Data privacy and data protection are areas of increasing legislative focus. For example, the California Consumer Protection Act of 2018 (the <CCPA=), which
became effective on January 1, 2020, applies to for-profit businesses that conduct business in California and meet certain revenue or data collection thresholds. The
CCPA gives consumers the right to request disclosure of information collected about them, and whether that information has been sold or shared with others, the
right to request deletion of personal information (subject to certain exceptions), the right to opt out of the sale of the consumer9s personal information, and the right
not to be discriminated against for exercising these rights. The CCPA contains several exemptions, including an exemption applicable to information that is collected,
processed, sold or disclosed subject to the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. The CCPA9s requirements will be further expanded under the California Privacy Rights Act
(<CPRA=) once it goes into effect on January 1, 2023. Similar laws have been and may be adopted by other states where we do business, such as Colorado and Virginia,
and the federal government may also pass data privacy or data protection legislation. In addition, in the European Union, privacy law is governed by the General Data
Protection Regulation (the <GDPR=). The GDPR established enhanced compliance obligations and increased penalties for non-compliance compared to the prior Data
Protection Directive which governed data privacy in the European Union.

In November 2021, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule requiring banking organizations to notify their primary banking regulator as soon as possible
and within 36 hours of determining that a <notification incident= has occurred. A notification incident is a <computer-security incident= that has materially disrupted or
degraded, or is reasonably likely to materially disrupt or degrade, the banking organization9s ability to carry out banking operations or deliver services to a material
portion of its customer base, result in a material loss of revenue, profit, or franchise value, or impact the stability of the U.S. financial sector. The final rule also
requires specific and immediate notifications by bank service providers that become aware of similar incidents. The final rule is effective April 1, 2022, with compliance
required by May 1, 2022.

Anti-Money Laundering, Sanctions and Anti-Corruption Regulations

U.S. anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act (<BSA=) and the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing
Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (<PATRIOT Act=) and their corresponding regulations, require IDIs, broker-dealers, and
certain other financial institutions to have policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing. The PATRIOT Act
and its regulations also provide for information sharing, subject to certain conditions, between federal law enforcement agencies and financial institutions, as well as
among financial institutions, for counter-terrorism purposes. Additionally, federal banking regulators are required, when reviewing bank holding company acquisition
and bank merger applications, to consider the effectiveness of the anti-money laundering activities of the applicants.

In January 2021, the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 (<AMLA=), which amends the BSA, was enacted. The AMLA is intended to comprehensively reform and
modernize U.S. anti-money laundering laws. Among other things, the AMLA codifies a risk-based approach to anti-money laundering compliance for financial
institutions; requires the development of standards by the U.S. Department of the Treasury for evaluating technology and internal processes for BSA compliance; and
expands

15
Table of Contents

enforcement- and investigation-related authority, including a significant expansion in the available sanctions for certain BSA violations. Many of the statutory
provisions in the AMLA will require additional rulemakings, reports and other measures, and the impact of the AMLA will depend on, among other things, rulemaking
and implementation guidance. In June 2021, FinCEN issued the priorities for anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism policy required under
AMLA. The priorities include: corruption, cybercrime, terrorist financing, fraud, transnational crime, drug trafficking, human trafficking and proliferation financing. In
December 2021, FinCEN issued a notice of proposed rulemaking regarding beneficial ownership information reporting, under which certain domestic and foreign
reporting companies would file reports with FinCEN regarding their beneficial ownership.

In addition, we must comply with economic sanctions administered by the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control and targeted against designated
foreign countries, nationals and others. We are also subject to anti-corruption laws and regulations in the United States and internationally, including the U.S. Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, which impose strict prohibitions on payments and hiring practices with regard to government officials and employees.

Material deficiencies in compliance with anti-money laundering and anti-corruption rules and sanctions regimes can result in public enforcement actions by the
bank regulatory agencies and other government agencies, including civil money penalties and supervisory restrictions on growth and expansion.

Regulation of Certain Subsidiaries and Regulatory Affiliates

SVB Securities LLC (formerly known as SVB Leerink LLC), a subsidiary of SVB Securities, and SVB Wealth Advisory, Inc., a subsidiary of the Bank, are each
registered as broker-dealers with the SEC and are members of FINRA, and are subject to regulation by both agencies. They are also members of the Securities Investor
Protection Corporation. SVB Asset Management, SVB Wealth Advisory and funds management entities associated with SVB Securities Capital LLC, a subsidiary of SVB
Securities, are registered with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, and are subject to its corresponding regulations.

SVB Securities LLC and SVB Wealth Advisory must comply with the financial responsibility rules governing broker-dealers, including Rule 15c3-1 under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the <Exchange Act=), which is designed to measure the general financial condition and liquidity of a broker-dealer and
seek to ensure its financial stability in light of its activities. Each of SVB Securities LLC and SVB Wealth Advisory is required to maintain minimum net capital levels,
which could, in the case of either entity, limit the ability for capital to be withdrawn or require a capital infusion to support growth in the business or new or ongoing
activities.

Further, the Company has oversight responsibilities with respect to the regulatory compliance of certain unconsolidated subsidiaries and affiliates that the
Company may be deemed to control for purposes of the BHC Act. In 2021, the Company restructured its relationships with Vouch Inc. and Bolster Networks, Inc. such
that the Company believes it is no longer deemed to control either entity for purposes of the BHC Act.

Securities Registration and Listing

SVB Financial9s common stock and Series A, B, C, D and E preferred stock are registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. SVB Financial9s common
stock and Series A Depositary Shares are also listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. As such, SVB Financial is subject to the SEC9s information, proxy solicitation,
insider trading, corporate governance, and other public company requirements and restrictions as well as Nasdaq9s Marketplace Rules and other requirements.

As a public company, SVB Financial is also subject to the accounting oversight and corporate governance requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the
<Sarbanes-Oxley Act=), including, among other things, required executive certification of financial presentations, increased requirements for board audit committees
and their members, and enhanced requirements relating to disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting.

International Regulation

Our international-based subsidiaries and offices and global activities, including our banking branches in the U.K., Germany, Canada and the Cayman Islands as
well as our joint venture bank in China, are subject to the respective laws and regulations of those countries and the regions in which they operate. This includes laws
and regulations promulgated by, but not limited to, the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority in the U.K., the Office of the
Superintendent of Financial Institutions in Canada, the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin), the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory
Commission, the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. Pursuant to UK regulatory requirements, Silicon Valley Bank will need to
restructure its UK branch into a full-service bank subsidiary when the branch reaches £100 million of insured small business deposits, which we currently expect will be
in mid-year 2022.

To the extent we are able to commence operations in any other international market, we will also become subject to the regulatory regimes of those
jurisdictions. In jurisdictions where we do not currently have certain licenses or other regulatory

16
Table of Contents

authorizations, our activities may be limited. Moreover, promulgation by standard-setting bodies that are charged with the development of international regulatory
frameworks, such as the Basel Committee, can affect the Bank and SVB Financial globally as national regulators implement the frameworks in local jurisdictions.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Our business faces material risks, including credit, market and liquidity, operational, legal and regulatory and strategic and reputational risks. The factors
described below are not intended to serve as a comprehensive listing of the risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we have not identified as material, or
of which we currently are not aware, may also impair our business operations. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following factors occurs, our
business, financial condition and/or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

Summary of Risk Factors

Credit Risks

" Because of the credit profile of our loan portfolio, our levels of nonperforming assets and charge-offs can be volatile, and we may need to make material
provisions for credit losses in any period.
" Our ACL is determined based upon both objective and subjective factors, and may not be adequate to absorb any actual credit losses.
" The borrowing needs of our clients have been and may continue to be unpredictable, especially during a challenging economic environment. We may not be
able to meet our unfunded credit commitments, or adequately reserve for losses, which could have a material adverse effect.
Market and Liquidity Risks

" Our interest rate spread may decline in the future. Any material reduction in our interest rate spread could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations or financial condition.
" Liquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and jeopardize our financial condition.
" Our equity warrant assets, venture capital and private equity fund investments and direct equity investment portfolio gains depend upon the performance of
our portfolio investments and the general condition of the public and private equity and M&A markets which are uncertain and may vary materially by
period.
" Changes in the market for public equity offerings, M&A or a slowdown in private equity or venture capital investment levels may affect the needs of our
clients for investment banking or M&A advisory services and lending products, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial
condition.
Operational Risks

" The COVID-19 pandemic has created significant economic and financial disruptions that have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect certain
aspects of our business and operations.
" The occurrence of fraudulent activity, breaches of our information security or cybersecurity-related incidents could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition or results of operations.
" We face risks associated with the ability of our IT systems and our people and processes to support our operations and future growth effectively.
" Business disruptions due to natural disasters and other external events beyond our control have in the past adversely affected our business, financial
condition or results of operations and may do so in the future.
" We face risks from a prolonged work-from-home arrangement, as well as from our eventual implementation of a broader plan to return to the office or
increase virtual working arrangements.
" We face risks from our interactions with business partners, service providers and other third parties.
" The soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.
17
Table of Contents

" We depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about customers and counterparties.
" We face risks associated with our current international operations and ongoing international expansion.
" Our holding company, SVB Financial, relies on equity warrant assets income, investment distributions and dividends from its subsidiaries for most of its cash
revenues.
" Climate change has the potential to disrupt our business and adversely impact the operations and creditworthiness of our clients.
" We have recently experienced, and continue to experience, significant growth, including deposit growth. Our current level of growth may not be sustainable.
Further, if our deposit growth continues at a similar or greater rate, we may need to raise additional equity to support our capital ratios.
Legal and Regulatory Risks

" We are subject to extensive regulation that could limit or restrict our activities, impose financial requirements or limitations on the conduct of our business,
or result in higher costs to us, and the stringency of the regulatory framework applicable to us may increase if, and as, our balance sheet continues to grow.
" As we have exceeded $100 billion of average total consolidated assets (over four quarters) during 2021, we are now subject to more stringent regulations,
including certain enhanced prudential standards applicable to large bank holding companies. If we exceed $250 billion of average total consolidated assets,
we will be subject to even more stringent regulations.
" We face a risk of noncompliance and enforcement action with the Bank Secrecy Act, other anti-money laundering and anti-bribery statutes and regulations,
and U.S. economic and trade sanctions.
" If we were to violate, or fail to comply with, international, federal or state laws or regulations governing financial institutions, we could be subject to
disciplinary action or litigation that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation.
" Laws and regulations regarding the handling of personal data and information may impede our services or result in increased costs, legal claims or fines
against us.
" Adverse results from litigation or governmental or regulatory investigations can impact our business practices and operating results.
" A failure to identify and address potential conflicts of interest could adversely affect our businesses.
" Anti-takeover provisions and federal laws may prevent a merger or acquisition that may be attractive to stockholders and/or have an adverse effect on our
stock price.
Strategic, Reputational and Other Risks

" Concentration of risk increases the potential for significant losses, while the establishment of limits to mitigate concentration risk increases the potential for
lower revenues and slower growth.
" Decreases in the amount of equity capital available to our clients could adversely affect us.
" We face competitive pressures that could adversely affect our business, financial results, or growth.
" Our ability to maintain or increase our market share depends on our ability to attract and maintain, as well as meet the needs of, existing and future clients.
" We face risks in connection with our strategic undertakings and new business initiatives.
" We may fail to realize growth prospects and benefits anticipated as a result of the Boston Private acquisition.
" Any damage to our reputation and relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business.
" An ineffective risk management framework could have a material adverse effect on our strategic planning and our ability to mitigate risks and/or losses and
could have adverse regulatory consequences.
" We do not currently pay dividends on shares of our common stock and may not do so in the future.
Credit Risks

Because of the credit profile of our loan portfolio, our levels of nonperforming assets and charge-offs can be volatile. We may need to make material provisions for
credit losses in any period, which could reduce net income, increase net losses or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition in that period.

Our loan portfolio has a credit profile different from that of most other banking companies. The credit profiles of our clients vary across our loan portfolio, based
on the nature of our lending to different market segments.

18
Table of Contents

Investor dependent loans. Many of our loans, particularly in our portfolios for early-stage and mid-stage privately held companies, are made to companies with
modest or negative cash flows and/or no established record of profitable operations, primarily within the technology, life science and healthcare industries.
Consequently, repayment of these loans is often dependent upon receipt by our borrowers of additional financing from venture capitalists or others, or in some cases,
a successful sale to a third party, public offering or other form of liquidity or <exit= event. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have caused certain client valuations
to drop, thereby reducing the rate of financing or other <exit= events for certain clients, which has had and may continue to have an adverse effect on certain of our
clients and their ability to repay their loans to us. Although these challenges have been offset by strong financial markets performance, relief programs and decreased
cash utilization, certain of these companies may experience difficulties sustaining their businesses over time. There can be no assurance that these companies will be
able to continue to obtain funding at current valuation levels, if at all and valuations may drop in a meaningful manner, which may impact the financial health of our
client companies. For example, volatility in financial markets may make IPOs less attractive to investors seeking an <exit= event. In such case, investors may provide
financing in a more selective manner, at lower levels and/or on less favorable terms, if at all, any of which may have an adverse effect on our borrowers9 ability to
repay their loans to us.

Larger loans; syndicated loans. In addition, a significant portion of our loan portfolio is comprised of larger loans, which could increase the impact on us of any
single borrower default. As of December 31, 2021, loans equal to or greater than $20 million to any single client (individually or in the aggregate) totaled $41.3 billion,
or 62 percent of our portfolio. These larger loans have represented an increasing portion of our total loan portfolio over time. They include capital call lines of credit to
our private equity and venture capital clients and SLBO loans, as well as other loans made to our later-stage and larger corporate clients, and may be made to
companies with greater levels of debt relative to their equity, balance sheet liquidity or cash flow. Additionally, we have continued our efforts to grow our loan
portfolio by agenting or arranging larger syndicated credit facilities and participating in larger syndicates agented by other financial institutions. In those arrangements
where we do not act as the lead syndicate agent, our control or decision-making ability over the credit facility is typically limited to our participation interest.

Loans dependent on third parties. Further, the repayment of financing arrangements we enter into with our clients may be dependent on the financial condition
or ability of third parties to meet their payment obligations to our clients. For example, we enter into formula-based financing arrangements that are secured by our
clients9 accounts receivable from third parties with whom they do business. We make loans secured by letters of credit issued by third party banks and enter into
letters of credit discounting arrangements, the repayment of which may be dependent on reimbursement by third party banks. We extend recurring revenue-based
lines of credit, where repayment may be dependent on borrowers9 revenues from third parties. We also extend project financing to solar and other renewable energy
providers, where repayment may be dependent on factors related to renewable energy generation, construction and access to take-out sources of financing, including
tax credit equity. Further, in our loan portfolio of private equity and venture capital firm clients, many of our clients have lines of credit, the repayment of which is
dependent on the payment of capital calls or management fees by the underlying limited partner investors in the funds managed by these firms. These capital call
lines of credit are a significant portion of our loan portfolio (capital call lines of credit represent more than half of our loan portfolio as of the end of 2021, and may in
future periods increase). These third parties may not be able to meet their financial obligations to our clients or to us, which, ultimately, could have an adverse impact
on us.

Technology, life science and healthcare industries. In addition, because of the intense competition and rapid technological change that characterize the
technology, life science and healthcare industry sectors in which most of our borrowers reside, as well as periodic volatility in the market prices for securities of
companies in these industries, a borrower9s financial position can deteriorate rapidly. Collateral for many of our loans often includes intellectual property and other
intangible assets, which are difficult to value and may not be readily salable in the case of default. As a result, even if a loan is secured, we may not be able to fully
recover the amounts owed to us, if at all.

Wineries and vineyards. In addition, we lend to premium wineries and vineyards through SVB Wine. Repayment of loans made to these clients may be
dependent on overall wine demand and sales, or other sources of financing or income which may be adversely affected by a challenging economic environment, as
well as the value of underlying real estate and non-real estate collateral, overall grape supply and income from tourism which may be adversely affected by climate
change, poor weather, heavy rains, flooding, droughts, fires, wildfires, earthquakes or other natural or catastrophic conditions. Our premium wine industry clients
have been and may continue to be impacted by the loss of restaurant and winery sales as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Loans to individuals. We also lend to individual investors, executives, entrepreneurs or other influencers in the innovation economy, primarily through SVB
Private Bank, a division of the Bank. Our lending to individuals has substantially increased due to our acquisition of Boston Private. These individual clients may face
difficulties meeting their financial commitments, especially in a challenging economic environment, and may be unable to repay their loans, and these difficulties may
be more acute if accompanied by a decline in real estate values. In certain instances, we may also relax loan

19
Table of Contents

covenants and conditions or extend loan terms to individual borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulties. While such determinations are based on an
assessment of various factors, including access to additional capital in the near term, there can be no assurance that such continued support will result in any
individual borrower meeting his or her financial commitments. Additionally, certain clients may prepay the principal amount of their loans. If we are unable to lend
those funds to other borrowers or invest the funds at the same or higher interest rates, our financial performance may be adversely impacted.

Commercial real estate loans. We acquired a portfolio of CRE loans as part of the Boston Private acquisition. CRE loans may lack standardized terms and may
include a significant principal balance or <balloon= payment due on maturity. CRE loans may involve a higher risk of default compared to our other types loans as a
result of several factors, including the financial condition of the borrower, prevailing economic conditions, occupancy, rental collections, interest rates and collateral
value. Additionally, the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the commercial real estate sector, including retail stores, hotels and office buildings, creates
greater risk exposure for our CRE loan portfolio.

Based on the credit profile of our overall loan portfolio, our level of nonperforming loans, loan charge-offs and ACL can be volatile and can vary materially from
period to period. Increases in our level of nonperforming loans, the acquisition of PCD loans, increases in loan charge-offs or changes in economic forecasts may
require us to increase our provision for credit losses in any period, which could reduce our net income or cause net losses in that period. The continued effects of
COVID-19 or other unforeseen events or future economic downturns or recessions may cause our clients to be unable to pay their loans as they come due or decrease
the value of collateral, such as accounts receivable, which could cause us to materially increase our ACL or incur credit losses in excess of the allowance in future
periods. For instance, during the first half of 2020 in response to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we significantly increased our ACL. Additionally, such increases
in our level of nonperforming loans, loan charge-offs or changes in economic forecasts may also have an adverse effect on our capital ratios, credit ratings and market
perceptions of us. See <Loans= under <Management9s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Consolidated Financial Condition=
under Part II, Item 7 of this report.

Our ACL is determined based upon both objective and subjective factors, and may not be adequate to absorb credit losses.

As a lender, we face the risk that our borrower clients will fail to repay their loans when due. If borrower defaults cause large aggregate losses, it could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. We reserve for such losses by establishing an ACL, the increase of which results in
a charge to our earnings as a provision for credit losses. Although we have established an evaluation process designed to determine the adequacy of our ACL that uses
historical and other objective information reflective of the classification of loans, the establishment of credit losses are also dependent on macroeconomic forecasts as
well as the subjective experience and judgment of our management. Actual losses are difficult to forecast, especially if such losses stem from factors beyond our
historical experience, as has occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic, or are otherwise inconsistent with our credit quality assessments. There can be no assurance
that our ACL will be sufficient to absorb future credit losses or prevent a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Our ability to accurately forecast estimated credit losses depends on whether our credit loss model and related inputs correspond to actual loss rates.
Banking regulators, as part of their supervisory function, periodically review our methodology, models and the underlying assumptions, estimates and
assessments we make in determining the adequacy of our ACL. These regulators may conclude that changes are necessary, which could impact our overall credit
portfolio. Such changes could result in, among other things, modifications to our methodology or models, reclassification or downgrades of our loans, increases in our
ACL or other credit costs, imposition of new or more stringent concentration limits, restrictions in our lending activities and/or recognition of further losses.

The borrowing needs of our clients have been and may continue to be unpredictable, especially during a challenging economic environment. We may not be able
to meet our unfunded credit commitments, or adequately reserve for losses associated with our unfunded credit commitments, which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation.

A commitment to extend credit is a formal agreement to lend funds to a client as long as the conditions established under the agreement have been satisfied.
The actual borrowing needs of our clients under these credit commitments have historically been lower than the contractual amount of the commitments. As a result,
we typically have a substantial amount of total unfunded credit commitments reflected off our balance sheet, and a significant portion of these commitments
ultimately expire without being drawn upon. See Note 21-<Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Guarantees and Other Commitments= of the <Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements= under Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional details. However, the actual borrowing needs of our clients may exceed our expected funding
requirements. For example, our client companies may be more dependent on our credit commitments in a challenging economic environment due to the lack of
available credit elsewhere, the increasing costs of credit through other channels, or the limited availability of financings

20
Table of Contents

from private equity or venture capital firms, such as occurred at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, when certain clients increased utilization of credit lines to
secure liquidity. In addition, limited partner investors of our private equity and venture capital fund clients may fail to meet their underlying investment commitments
due to liquidity or other financing difficulties, which may impact our clients9 borrowing needs. Any failure to meet our unfunded credit commitments in accordance
with the actual borrowing needs of our clients may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation.

Further, although we have established a reserve for losses associated with our unfunded credit commitments, the level of the reserve is determined by a
methodology that is similar to that used to establish our ACL in our funded loan portfolio and that has also been amended by CECL. The reserve is susceptible to
significant changes and is primarily based on credit commitments less the amounts that have been funded, the amount of the unfunded portion that we expect to be
utilized in the future, credit quality of the loan credit commitments, and management9s estimates and judgment. There can be no assurance that our allowance for
unfunded credit commitments will be adequate to provide for actual losses associated with our unfunded credit commitments. An increase in the allowance for
unfunded credit commitments in any period may result in a charge to our earnings, which could reduce our net income or increase net losses in that period.

Market and Liquidity Risks

Our interest rate spread may decline in the future. Any material reduction in our interest rate spread could have a material adverse effect on our business, results
of operations or financial condition.

A significant portion of our net income comes from our interest rate spread, which is the difference between the interest rates paid by us on interest-bearing
liabilities, such as deposits and internal borrowings, and the interest rates and fees we receive on our interest-earning assets, such as loans extended to our clients,
securities held in our investment portfolio and excess cash held to manage short-term liquidity. Our interest rate spread can be affected by the mix of loans,
investment securities, deposits and other liabilities on our balance sheet, as well as a variety of external factors beyond our control that affect interest rate levels, such
as competition, inflation, recession, global economic disruptions, unemployment and the fiscal and monetary policies of various governmental bodies, such as the
Federal Reserve. For example, changes in key variable market interest rates, such as the Federal Funds, National Prime (<Prime=), LIBOR or Treasury rates, generally
impact our interest rate spread. While changes in interest rates do not generally produce equivalent changes in the revenues earned from our interest-earning assets
and the expenses associated with our interest-bearing liabilities, increases in market interest rates are nevertheless likely to cause our interest rate spread to increase.
Conversely, if interest rates decline, our interest rate spread will likely decline. Although it is expected that the Federal Reserve will increase the target Federal Funds
rate in 2022 to combat recent inflationary trends, if interest rates do not rise, or if the Federal Reserve lowers the target Federal Funds rate to below 0%, these low
rates could continue to constrain our interest rate spread and may adversely affect our business forecasts. On the other hand, increases in interest rates, to combat
inflation or otherwise, may result in a change in the mix of non-interest and interest-bearing accounts, and the level of off-balance sheet market-based investment
preferred by our clients, which may also impact our interest rate spread. We are unable to predict changes in interest rates, which are affected by factors beyond our
control, including inflation, deflation, recession, unemployment, money supply, and other changes in financial markets.

Changes in the method of determining LIBOR or other reference rates, or uncertainty related to such potential changes, may adversely affect the value of
reference rate-linked debt securities that we hold or issue, which could further impact our interest rate spread. In 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority
announced that it would no longer persuade or compel submission of bank rates used for calculation of LIBOR after 2021. In 2020, the administrator of LIBOR
announced that it will extend publication of the most commonly used U.S. Dollar LIBOR settings to June 30, 2023 and the administrator ceased publishing other LIBOR
settings immediately after December 31, 2021. The federal banking agencies have issued guidance strongly encouraging banking organizations to cease using the U.S.
Dollar LIBOR as a reference rate in new contracts as soon as practicable and in any event by December 31, 2021.

Regulators, industry groups and certain committees (for example, the ARRC) have published recommended fallback language for LIBOR-linked financial
instruments, identified recommended alternatives for certain LIBOR rates (e.g., the SOFR as the recommended alternative to U.S. Dollar LIBOR), and proposed
implementations of the recommended alternatives in floating rate instruments. At this time, it is not possible to predict whether these recommendations and
proposals will be broadly accepted in their current form, whether they will continue to evolve, and what the ultimate effect of their implementation may be on the
markets for floating-rate financial instruments.

Liquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and jeopardize our financial condition.

Liquidity is essential to our business, both at the SVB Financial and the Bank level. We require sufficient liquidity to meet our expected financial obligations, as
well as unexpected requirements stemming from client activity and market changes, such as the unexpected cash outflows that occurred at the onset of the COVID-19
pandemic when certain clients increased utilization of their credit lines. Primary liquidity resources for SVB Financial include: cash flow from investments and interest
in

21
Table of Contents

financial assets held by operating subsidiaries other than the Bank; to the extent declared, dividends from the Bank; and as needed, periodic capital market
transactions offering debt and equity instruments in the public and private markets. The primary source of liquidity for the Bank is client deposits. When needed, our
liquidity is supplemented by wholesale borrowing capacity in the form of short- and long-term borrowings secured by our portfolio of high-quality investment
securities, long-term capital market debt issuances and unsecured overnight funding channels available to us in the Federal Funds market. An inability to maintain or
raise funds through these sources could have a substantial negative effect, individually or collectively, on SVB Financial and the Bank9s liquidity. Our access to funding
sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities, or on terms attractive to us, could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services
industry in general. For example, factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity due to a
market downturn or adverse regulatory action against us, a downturn in asset markets such that the collateral we hold cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not
sufficient to recover the full amount of our secured obligations, a reduction in our credit rating, any damage to our reputation or any other decrease in depositor or
investor confidence in our creditworthiness and business. Our access to liquidity could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as laws and
regulations that limit the amount of intercompany dividends that bank subsidiaries may pay, severe volatility or disruption of the financial markets or negative views
and expectations about prospects for the financial services industry as a whole. Any such event or failure to manage our liquidity effectively could affect our
competitive position, increase our borrowing costs and the interest rates we pay on deposits, limit our access to the capital markets and have a material adverse effect
on our financial condition.

Our equity warrant assets, venture capital and private equity fund investments and direct equity investment portfolio gains depend upon the performance of our
portfolio investments and the general condition of the public and private equity and M&A markets, which are uncertain and may vary materially by period.

In connection with negotiated credit facilities and certain other services, we often obtain equity warrant assets giving us the right to acquire stock in private,
venture-backed companies primarily in the technology, life science and healthcare industries subject to applicable regulatory limits and, in some cases, we retain
equity interests in these companies following their initial public offering. We have also made investments through SVB Financial, SVB Securities and our SVB Capital
family of funds in venture capital funds and direct investments in companies. We may enter into hedging arrangements with respect to some of the SVB Capital equity
positions; many of these interests are required to be carried at fair value and may be impacted by changes in fair value. The fair values of these warrants and
investments are reflected in our financial statements and are adjusted on a quarterly basis. Fair value changes are recorded as unrealized gains or losses through
consolidated net income. However, the timing and amount of changes in fair value, if any, of these financial instruments depends on factors beyond our control,
including the perceived and actual performance of the companies or funds in which we invest, fluctuations in the market prices of the preferred or common stock of
the portfolio companies, the timing of our receipt of relevant financial information from these companies, market volatility and interest rate factors and legal and
contractual restrictions. Though valuations and financial markets have rebounded since the earlier stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, the prolonged negative effects of
the COVID-19 pandemic may have a further impact on the value of these assets (potentially in a significant manner). Additionally, macroeconomic factors beyond our
control, including inflationary trends, financial markets volatility and geopolitical issues and events, such as the escalating military tension between Russia and
Ukraine, may adversely impact the value of our investments. Moreover, the timing and amount of our realization of actual net proceeds, if any, from our disposition of
these financial instruments also often depend on factors beyond our control. In addition to those mentioned above, such factors include the level of public offerings,
and M&A or other exit activity, legal and contractual restrictions on our ability to sell our equity positions (including the expiration of any <lock-up= agreements) and
the timing of any actual dispositions. The net proceeds we receive from these financial instruments, and our financial statements more generally, may also be affected
by hedging arrangements we may enter into with respect to such instruments at SVB Capital. Because of the inherent variability of these financial instruments and the
markets in which they are bought and sold, their fair market value might increase or decrease materially from period to period, and the net proceeds ultimately
realized upon disposition might be materially different than the then-current recorded fair market value.

In addition, depending on the fair value of these warrants and direct equity investments, a meaningful portion of the aggregate fair value of our total warrant
and direct equity investment portfolios may, from time to time, be concentrated in a limited number of warrants and direct equity investments. Valuation changes in
one or more of these warrants or direct equity investments (or any potential related hedging transactions) may have a material impact on our financial statements and
the valuation of our total investment portfolio. Moreover, because valuations of private companies are inherently uncertain, may fluctuate over short periods of time
and may be based on estimates, our determinations of fair value for private companies may differ materially from the values that would have been used if a ready
market for these securities existed. Therefore, fair value determinations may materially understate or overstate the value that we ultimately realize upon the sale of
one or more investments. We cannot predict future realized or unrealized gains or losses, and any such gains or losses are likely to vary materially from period to
period. See Note 16-=Derivative Financial Instruments= of the <Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements= under Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional
details.

Changes in the market for public equity offerings, M&A or a slowdown in private equity or venture capital investment levels may affect the needs of our clients for
investment banking or M&A advisory services and lending products, which could in turn adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.

While an active market for public equity offerings, financings, and M&A activity generally has positive implications for our business, one negative consequence is
that our clients may pay off or reduce their loans with us if they complete a public equity offering, are acquired by or merge with another entity or otherwise receive a
significant equity investment.

By contrast, a low demand for public equity or M&A transactions or an inability to complete such transactions due to events affecting market conditions
generally, could result in fewer transactions overall and therefore decrease revenues of SVB Securities, our investment banking business, as such revenues stem
primarily from underwriting and advisory fees associated with capital markets and M&A transactions. Although there was strong capital markets activity in the
healthcare and technology sectors in 2021, a decline in this activity in the future could lead to decreased revenues of SVB Securities.

A slowdown in overall private equity or venture capital investment levels may reduce the need for our clients to borrow from our capital call lines of credit,
which are typically utilized by our private equity and venture capital fund clients to make investments prior to receipt of capital called from their respective limited
partners. Any significant reduction in the outstanding amounts of our loans or under our lines of credit could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations or financial condition.

Operational Risks

The COVID-19 pandemic has created significant economic and financial disruptions that have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect certain
aspects of our business and operations.

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant impacts to global health and economic conditions that have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely
affect, certain aspects of our business and operations Although financial markets have rebounded from the significant declines that occurred earlier in the pandemic,
and global economic conditions showed signs of improvement in the second half of 2020 and in 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to contribute to, among
other things (i) increased unemployment and decreased consumer confidence and business generally, leading to an increased risk of delinquencies, defaults and
foreclosures; (ii) sudden and significant declines, and significant increases in volatility, in financial markets; (iii) ratings downgrades, credit deterioration and defaults in
many industries; (iv) increased utilization of credit lines as clients seek to bolster liquidity; (v) fluctuations in the targeted federal funds rate as result of monetary
policy measures in response to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including inflationary pressures; (vi) the exacerbation of recent inflationary trends and (vii)
heightened cybersecurity, information security and operational risks as a result of work-from-home arrangements and the current environment, including increased
fraudulent activity. In addition, we also face an increased risk of client disputes, litigation and governmental and regulatory scrutiny as a result of the effects of COVID-
19 on market and economic conditions, actions that governmental authorities take in response to those conditions, and our implementation of and participation in
special financial relief programs, such as the SBA9s PPP and U.K. Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme ("CBILS"). Moreover, we have focused resources and
management attention towards managing the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, and we have and likely will have to continue to balance managing these impacts

while also devoting resources and management attention toward certain growth initiatives and other investments in the near term.

Early-stage companies and certain industries (including the premium wine industry) where the Company has credit exposure, have experienced, and are
expected to continue to experience, significant operational and financial challenges as a result of COVID-19. The effects of COVID-19 may also cause our clients to be
unable to pay their loans as they come due or decrease the value of collateral, such as accounts receivable, which we expect would cause significant increases in our
credit losses.

We remain unable to predict the full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to negatively affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, capital
and results of operations. The extent of any continued or future adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic will depend on future developments, which are highly
uncertain and outside our control, including the scope and duration of the pandemic, the direct and indirect impact of the pandemic on our employees, clients,
counterparties and service providers, as well as other market participants, actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the
pandemic, the scope and duration of future phases or outbreaks, or seasonal or other resurgences, of the disease (including variants thereof), and the effectiveness
and implementation of vaccination efforts. For example, the omicron variant of COVID-19 has led to a spike in COVID-19 cases across the United States, which has
caused travel, supply chain and other disruptions, and certain governmental authorities and other third parties have re-imposed restrictions in order to respond to the
rise in cases attributable to the omicron variant.

The occurrence of fraudulent activity, breaches of our information security or cybersecurity-related incidents could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition or results of operations.

As a financial institution, we are susceptible to fraudulent activity, information security breaches and cybersecurity-related incidents that could be committed
against us, our clients or our third-party partners, which may result in financial losses or increased costs to us or our clients, disclosure or misuse of our information or
our client information, misappropriation of assets, privacy breaches against our employees or clients, litigation or damage to our reputation. Such fraudulent activity
may take many forms, including credit fraud, check fraud, electronic fraud, wire fraud, phishing, social engineering, business email compromise, ransomware,
malfeasance and other dishonest acts. For example, in 2021 and as disclosed in previous filings, we incurred an $80 million charge-off related to fraudulent activity.
Information security breaches and cybersecurity-related incidents may include fraudulent or unauthorized access to systems used by us, our clients or third-party
partners, denial or degradation of service attacks, malware or other cyber-attacks. Sources of attacks vary and may include hackers, employees, vendors, business
partners, organized crime, terrorists, foreign governments, corporate espionage and activists. Breaches may also be a result of human errors or mistakes

unintentionally caused by us. In recent periods, there continues to be a rise in electronic fraudulent activity, security breaches and cyber-attacks within the financial
services industry, especially in the commercial banking sector due to cyber criminals targeting commercial bank accounts. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we
continued to experience heightened fraud and cybersecurity risks, as well as other information security risks, particularly as a result of work-from-home arrangements,
which may be more susceptible to inadvertent human errors given the change in operating environment.

Consistent with industry trends, we remain at risk for attempted electronic fraudulent activity, as well as attempts at security breaches and cybersecurity-related
incidents. Cybersecurity risks may increase in the future as we increase our mobile, digital and internet-based product offerings and expand our internal use of
internet-based products and applications, which we expect to remain elevated as long as the COVID-19 pandemic continues. Moreover, in recent periods, large
corporations (including financial institutions and retail companies), as well as U.S. governmental agencies, have suffered significant data breaches or malware attacks,
in some cases exposing not only confidential and proprietary corporate information, but also sensitive financial and other personal information of their customers and
employees and subjecting them to potentially fraudulent activity. Some of our clients may have been affected by these breaches, which increase their risks of identity
theft, credit card fraud and other fraudulent activity that could involve their accounts with us, which could subject us to potential liability. Additionally, state-
sponsored or terrorist-sponsored efforts to hack or disable IT systems increases risks, since the motivation may be for geopolitical as much as for financial gain.

Information pertaining to us and our clients is maintained, and transactions are executed, on our networks and systems, as well as those of our clients and
certain of our third-party partners, such as our online banking or reporting systems. The secure maintenance and transmission of confidential information, as well as
execution of transactions over these systems, are essential to protect us and our clients against fraud and security breaches and to maintain our clients9 confidence.
Breaches of information security also may occur, and in infrequent cases have occurred, through intentional or unintentional acts by those having access to our
systems or our clients9 or counterparties9 confidential information, including employees and third-party contractors. In addition, SVB provides card transaction
processing services to some merchant customers under agreements we have with those merchants and/or with the payment networks. Under these agreements, we
may be responsible for certain losses and penalties if one of our merchant customers suffers a data security breach. Furthermore, SVB9s cardholders use their debit
and credit cards to make purchases from third parties or through third-party processing services. As such, SVB is subject to risk from data breaches of such third
party9s information systems or its payment processors, for reasons including unauthorized card use. Such a data security breach could compromise SVB9s account
information, cause losses on card accounts and increase litigation costs. SVB may suffer losses associated with reimbursing our customers for such fraudulent
transactions on customers9 card accounts, as well as for other costs related to data security breaches, such as replacing cards associated with compromised card
accounts.

We also offer certain services that allow non-accountholders to process payments through SVB9s systems, as well as financial analytics services. In the course of
providing those services, we may obtain sensitive data about customers who do not otherwise hold accounts with us, including information regarding accounts held at
other institutions, as well as profit and loss and other proprietary financial or other information regarding our customers or the non-accountholders they service. In
the event of a data breach, this sensitive information may be exposed and could subject us to claims for damages.

In addition, increases in criminal activity levels and sophistication, advances in computer capabilities, ongoing work-from-home arrangements for our employees,
integrating new employees into the Company, vulnerabilities in third-party technologies and services (including cloud computing and storage, computing hardware,
browsers and operating systems) or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the technology, processes and controls that we use to prevent
fraudulent transactions and to protect data about us, our clients and underlying transactions, as well as the technology used by our clients to access our systems. The
forms, methods and sophistication of fraud, security breaches, cyber-attacks and other similar criminal activity continue to evolve, and as we evolve and grow our
business, especially in new business lines or

24
Table of Contents

geographic areas, we may be unable to foresee future risks. Although we have developed, and continue to invest in, systems and processes that are designed to detect
and prevent security breaches and cyber-attacks and periodically test our security and effectiveness of our cyber incident response plans, our risk mitigation strategies
and internal controls, including risk assessment policies and procedures, testing, backup and redundancy systems, incident response plans, training and authentication
or encryption tools, may not be effective against defending against fraud, security breaches or cyber-attacks, and any insurance we maintain may not be sufficient to
compensate us for all losses that may occur. Our inability to anticipate, or failure to adequately mitigate, fraudulent activities, breaches of security or cyber-attacks
could result in: financial losses to us or our clients; our loss of business and/or clients; loss or exposure of our confidential data or information; damage to our
reputation; the incurrence of additional expenses; loss of personnel; disruption to our business; force majeure claims by us or critical suppliers; our inability to grow
our online services or other businesses; additional regulatory scrutiny or penalties; or our exposure to civil litigation and possible financial liability.

We face risks associated with the ability of our IT systems and our people and processes to support our operations and future growth effectively.

Our IT systems, the data stored in those systems, people and internal business processes are critical to our operations and future growth, and have been critical
to our continued operations during the COVID-19 pandemic as we implemented work-from-home arrangements and onboarded new employees in an entirely remote
work environment. Our systems may be subject to service outages from time to time due to various reasons, including infrastructure failures, interruptions due to
system upgrades or malware removal, employee error or malfeasance, or other force majeure-related reasons (such as potential blackouts or brownouts in California),
which could cause business disruption. Further, the functionality and reliability of our IT systems may be compromised if the data contained in those systems is
inaccurate, outdated or corrupt. Additionally, our systems and processes need to be sufficiently scalable to operate effectively, and we need to have the appropriate
talent and organizational structures to support our business. Many of our systems and processes are interdependent and interconnected, meaning that a service
outage or operational inefficiency with respect to one system or process could negatively impact other systems or processes. As a result, we continue to invest in
technology and more automated solutions in order to optimize the efficiency of our core operational and administrative infrastructure. In the absence of having
effective automated solutions, we may rely on manual processes which may be more prone to error. Moreover, as we evolve, we may further install or implement
new systems and processes or otherwise replace, upgrade or make other modifications to our existing systems and processes. These changes could be costly and
require significant investment in the training of our employees and other third-party partners, as well as impose substantial demands on management time. If we do
not implement new initiatives or utilize new technologies effectively or in accordance with regulatory requirements, or if our people (including outsourced business
partners) are not appropriately trained or developed or do not perform their functions properly or have the appropriate resources to do so, we could experience
business interruptions or other system failures which, among other things, could result in inefficiencies, revenue losses, loss of clients, employee dissatisfaction,
exposure to fraudulent activities, regulatory enforcement actions or damage to our reputation, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Business disruptions and interruptions due to natural disasters and other external events beyond our control have in the past adversely affected our business,
financial condition or results of operations and may do so in the future.

Our operations can be subject to natural disasters and other external events beyond our control, such as the effects of earthquakes, fires, floods, severe
weather, public health issues such as the recent outbreak of the coronavirus or other pandemic diseases, power failures, telecommunication loss, major accidents,
terrorist attacks, acts of war, political, economic and social unrest, and other natural and man-made events, some of which may be intensified by the effects of climate
change and changing weather patterns. For example, our corporate headquarters and some of our critical business offices are located in California, which has
experienced major wildfires and blackouts and is located over major earthquake fault lines. We also maintain critical business facilities in Texas, which has experienced
severe weather conditions, major blackouts and water service disruptions. Additionally, we conduct certain finance, human resources and technology and loan
operations in India, which has experienced severe weather conditions, floods and public health issues as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, climate
change, the increasing frequency or severity of weather events, an earthquake or other disaster could cause severe destruction, disruption or interruption to our
operations or property and significantly impact our employees and could damage, destroy or otherwise reduce the value of collateral, which could materially increase

our credit losses. More recently, the COVID-19 pandemic has had direct effects on our operations, including by limiting employee travel and increasing telecommuting
arrangements. We may experience negative effects of prolonged work-from-home arrangements that continue to be in effect, such as increased risks of systems
access or connectivity issues, cybersecurity or information security breaches, and challenges our employees may face in maintaining a balance between work and
home life, which may lead to reduced productivity and/or significant disruptions in our business operations.

We and other financial institutions generally must resume operations promptly following any interruption. If we were to suffer a disruption or interruption and
were not able to resume normal operations within a period consistent with industry standards, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be
adversely affected in a material manner. In addition, depending on the nature and duration of the disruption or interruption, we might become vulnerable to fraud,
additional expense or other losses, or to a loss of business and clients. Although we have implemented a business continuity management program that we continue
to enhance on an ongoing basis, there can be no assurance that the program will adequately mitigate the risks of such business disruptions and interruptions.

Additionally, natural disasters and external events, including but not limited to those that have occurred and may occur in and around California, have affected,
and could in the future affect, the business and operations of our clients, which could impair their ability to repay their loans or fees when due, impair the value of
collateral securing their loans, cause our clients to reduce their deposits with us, or otherwise adversely affect their business dealings with us, any of which could have
a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. A portion of our client borrowers, including our premium winery and vineyard
clients, our SVB Private Bank mortgage clients and other corporate clients, are located in or have offices in California, which has historically experienced severe natural
disasters resulting in disruptions to businesses and damage to property, including wildfires and earthquakes. If there is a major earthquake, flood, fire, drought or
other natural or catastrophic disaster in California or elsewhere in the markets in which we operate due to climate change or otherwise, our borrowers may
experience uninsured property losses or sustained disruption to business or loss that may materially impair their ability to meet the terms of their loan obligations.

We face risks from a prolonged work-from-home arrangement, as well as from our eventual implementation of a broader plan to return to the office or increase
virtual working arrangements.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we moved to a work-from-home plan, restricted business travel, postponed or moved to online SVB-hosted events and
enabled remote access to our systems. Currently, the vast majority of our employees continue to work remotely as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and our longer-
term plan to increase virtual or remote working arrangements. Although our work-from-home plan has been effective thus far, we may experience negative effects of
a prolonged work-from-home arrangement, such as increasing risks of systems access or connectivity issues, cybersecurity or information security breaches,
difficulties integrating new employees, reduced team collaboration, or imbalances between work and home life, which may lead to reduced productivity and/or
significant disruptions in our business operations.

Moreover, while we have begun reopening certain of our offices and welcoming back employees at those locations (in addition to allowing certain virtual or
remote working arrangements), the manner and timing of fully reopening our offices is not yet finalized. Our ability to fully reopen our offices will be subject to a
variety of complex considerations including, among others, the duration of the pandemic and emergence of new variants, including the omicron variant, international,
federal, state and local government laws, regulations and guidance, health organization guidance, health and safety implications (including the availability of
vaccinations, potential health testing requirements and vaccination mandates) and employee needs, and the practical requirements of potential office
reconfigurations or a phased return. We have also expanded our work model to increase virtual or remote working arrangements once our offices reopen fully, and if
implemented ineffectively, this may also result in reduced productivity and/or significant disruptions in our business operations.

We face reputation and business risks due to our interactions with business partners, service providers and other third parties.

As a financial service institution with domestic and international operations, we rely on third parties, both in the United States and internationally in countries
such as the U.K., Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Israel, China, Hong Kong, India and Canada to provide services to us and our clients or otherwise act as partners in our
business activities in a variety of ways, including through the provision of key components of our business infrastructure. We expect these third parties to perform
services for us, fulfill their obligations to us, accurately inform us of relevant information, and conduct their activities in a manner that reflects positively on our brand
and business. Although we manage exposure to such third-party risk through a variety of means, including the performance of due diligence and ongoing monitoring
of vendor performance, there can be no assurance these efforts will be effective. Any failure of our business partners, service providers or other third parties to meet
their commitments to us or to perform in accordance with our expectations, either due to their actions or inactions, or due to natural disasters or other external
events beyond their control, could result in operational disruptions, increased expenditures, regulatory actions in which we may be held responsible for the actions of
third parties, damage to our reputation and the loss of clients, which in turn could harm our business and operations, strategic growth objectives and financial
performance. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, many of our counterparties and third-party service providers have been, and may further be, affected by <stay-at-
home= orders, disruptions of global supply chains, market volatility and other factors that increase their risk of business disruption or that may otherwise affect their
ability to perform under the terms of any agreements with us or provide essential services.

Table of Contents

Our third-party partners may also rely on their own business partners and service providers in the ordinary course of their business. Although we seek to
diversify our exposure to third-party partners in order to increase our resiliency, we are nevertheless exposed to the risk that a disruption or other IT event at a
common service provider to our vendors could impede their ability to provide products or services to us, which in turn could harm our business and operations,
strategic growth objectives and financial performance.

The soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.

Financial services institutions are interrelated because of trading, clearing, counterparty and other relationships. We routinely execute transactions with
counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, payment processors and other institutional
clients, which may result in payment obligations to us or to our clients due to products we have arranged. Many of these transactions expose us to credit and market
risk that may cause our counterparty or client to default. In particular, the interconnectivity of multiple financial services institutions with central agents, exchanges
and clearing houses, and the increased centrality of these entities, increases the risk that an operational failure at one institution or entity may cause an industry-wide
operational failure that could materially impact our ability to conduct business. Any losses arising from such occurrences could materially and adversely affect our
business, results of operations or financial condition.

We depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about customers and counterparties.

In deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with customers and counterparties, we may rely on information furnished to us by or on
behalf of customers and counterparties, including financial statements and other information relating to their business or financial condition. We also may rely on
representations of customers and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports or
other certifications of their auditors or accountants. For example, under our accounts receivable financing arrangements, we rely on information, such as invoices,
contracts and other supporting documentation, provided by our clients and their account debtors to determine the amount of credit to extend. Similarly, in deciding
whether to extend credit, we may rely upon our customers9 representations that their financial statements conform to GAAP (or other applicable accounting
standards in foreign markets) and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the customer. If we rely on
materially misleading, false, inaccurate or fraudulent information in evaluating the creditworthiness or other risk profiles of our clients or counterparties, we could be
subject to credit losses, regulatory action, reputational harm or experience other adverse effects on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

We face risks associated with our current international operations and ongoing international expansion.

One important component of our strategy is to expand internationally. We currently have international offices in Canada, the U.K., Israel, Germany, Denmark,
Ireland, India, Hong Kong and China, including a joint-venture bank in China. We have expanded and plan to continue to expand and grow our operations and business
activities in some of our current international markets. For example, we have expanded our presence in India, where we currently conduct certain technology, human
resources and finance operations. Additionally, we are in the process of converting our U.K. branch to a separate U.K. banking subsidiary due to our growth. We also
plan to expand our business beyond our current markets over time. Our efforts to expand our business internationally carry certain risks, including risks arising from
the uncertainty regarding our ability to generate revenues from foreign operations; risks associated with leveraging and doing business with local business partners
through joint ventures, strategic arrangements or other partnerships; and other general operational risks. In addition, there are certain risks inherent in doing business
on an international basis, including, among others, legal, regulatory and tax requirements and restrictions; uncertainties regarding liability, tariffs and other trade
barriers, such as recent trade tensions between the United States and China; uncertainties regarding international public health issues like the COVID-19 pandemic;
changes in governmental policies, unfavorable political and diplomatic developments, terrorism or other geopolitical events; difficulties in staffing and managing
foreign operations; the incremental requirement of management9s attention and resources; differing technology standards or customer requirements; data security or
transfer risks; cultural differences; political and economic risks such as uncertainty created by the withdrawal of the U.K. from the European Union and escalating
military tension between Russia and Ukraine; and financial risks, including currency and payment risks such as fluctuation in the value of foreign currencies, such as
the euro. These risks could hinder our ability, or the ability of our local partners, to service our clients effectively, and adversely affect the success of our international
operations, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our overall business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, we face risks that our
employees and affiliates may fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations governing our international operations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act, U.K. Bribery Act, GDPR, anti-corruption laws, privacy laws, anti-money laundering laws, economic and trade sanctions requirements and other applicable laws and
regulations. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could, among other things, result in enforcement actions and fines against us, as well as limitations on
the conduct of our business, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

Our holding company, SVB Financial, relies on equity warrant assets income, investment distributions, periodic capital market transactions and dividends from its
subsidiaries for most of its cash revenues.

SVB Financial is a holding company and is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries. It receives most of its cash revenues from a few primary
funding sources: income from equity warrant assets and investment securities, from periodic capital markets transactions offering debt and equity instruments in the
public and private markets, and, to the extent declared, cash dividends paid by subsidiaries, primarily the Bank. These sources generate cash which is used by SVB
Financial to pay operating and borrowing costs and, to the extent authorized or declared, fund dividends to holders of its capital stock and stock repurchase programs.
Any income derived from those financial instruments is subject to a variety of factors as discussed in the <Credit Risks= portion of this <Risk Factors= section.
Moreover, various federal and state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that the Bank and certain of our nonbank subsidiaries may pay to SVB
Financial. In addition, SVB Financial9s right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a liquidation or reorganization of any of its subsidiaries is subject to the prior
claims of the subsidiary9s creditors.

Climate change has the potential to disrupt our business and adversely impact the operations and creditworthiness of our clients.

Climate change presents both near and long-term risks to our business and that of our customers, and these risks are expected to increase over time. Climate
change has caused severe weather patterns and events that could disrupt operations at one or more of our locations, which may disrupt our ability to provide financial
products and services to our clients. Longer-term changes, such as increasing average temperatures and rising sea levels, may damage, destroy or otherwise impact
the value or productivity of our properties and other assets, reduce the availability of insurance, and/or lead to prolonged disruptions in our operations. Climate
change could also have a negative effect on the financial status and creditworthiness of our clients, such as those in the wine industry, which may decrease revenues
and business activities from those clients, increase the credit risk associated with loans and other credit exposures to such clients, and decrease the value of our
warrants and direct equity investments in such clients, if any.

Climate exposes us to risks associated with the transition to a less carbon-dependent economy. Such risks may result from changes in policies, laws and
regulations, technologies, or market preferences to address climate change. Such changes could materially and negatively impact our business, results of operations,
financial condition and our reputation, in addition to having a similar impact on our customers. Federal and state regulatory authorities, investors and other third
parties have increasingly viewed financial institutions as important in addressing the risks related to climate change, which may result in financial institutions facing
increased pressure regarding the disclosure and management of climate risks and related lending and investment activities. Further, we have announced
commitments related to the management of climate risks and the transition to a less carbon-dependent economy. Our inability to meet these commitments may
subject us to, among other risks, increased business, operational and reputational risk.

Climate change could impose systemic risks upon the financial sector, either through operational disruptions or as a result of transitioning to a less carbon-
dependent economy. While we are focused on enhancing our governance practices surrounding the management of climate change-related risks, we may face
increased regulatory scrutiny related to our resilience to climate-related risks, including in the context of stress testing for various climate stress scenarios. Ongoing
legislative or regulatory uncertainties and changes regarding climate risk management and practices may result in higher regulatory, compliance, credit and
reputational risks and costs.

We have recently experienced, and continue to experience, significant growth, including deposit growth. Our current level of growth may not be sustainable.
Further, if our deposit growth continues at a similar or greater rate, we may need to raise additional equity to support our capital ratios.

We have experienced significant balance sheet growth in recent periods, which puts a strain on our business, operations, and employees. Failure to effectively
manage our growth could lead us to over-invest or under-invest in our operations, result in weaknesses in our internal controls, give rise to operational mistakes,
financial losses, loss of business opportunities and loss of client satisfaction, invite increased regulatory scrutiny, and result in loss of employees and reduced
productivity of remaining employees. If our management is unable to effectively manage our growth, our expenses may increase more than expected, and our
revenues may not increase or may grow more slowly than expected.

In particular, we have experienced significant deposit inflows. In 2021, our average deposits increased by 97.2% to $147.9 billion and our deposits ended the year
at $189.2 billion up from $102.0 billion at the end of 2020. In recent periods, deposit growth has been driven by our clients across all segments obtaining liquidity
through liquidity events, such as IPOs, secondary offerings, SPAC fundraising, venture capital investments, acquisitions and other fundraising activities4which during
2021 were at notably high levels. We are unable to predict whether these liquidity events will continue at all or at the rate they have been recently occurring. In
addition, our level of deposits depends on whether clients determine to keep proceeds from liquidity events and other funds in deposit products with us (as opposed
to off-balance sheet products, such as

28

third-party money market funds). Although clients have historically retained a significant portion of their funds on our balance sheet, we are unable to predict whether
they will continue to do so, and whether the recent level of deposit growth will be sustained.

The increase in on-balance sheet deposits also increases our assets and accordingly decreases our capital ratios for which assets (both total and risk-weighted) is
the denominator. If there is further deposit growth we may need to raise additional capital, including common equity, as we have done in 2021. For example, to
support this growth in 2021 we issued four series of preferred stock with total proceeds of $3.3 billion and issued 4,227,000 shares of common stock through two
public offerings.

Legal and Regulatory Risks

We are subject to extensive regulation that could limit or restrict our activities, impose financial requirements or limitations on the conduct of our business, or
result in higher costs to us, and the stringency of the regulatory framework applicable to us may increase if, and as, our balance sheet continues to grow.

SVB Financial, including the Bank, is extensively regulated under federal and state laws and regulations governing financial institutions, including those imposed
by the FDIC, the Federal Reserve, the CFPB, the SEC, and the DFPI, as well as various regulatory authorities that govern our global activities. Federal and state laws and
regulations govern, restrict, limit or otherwise affect the activities in which we may engage and may affect our ability to expand our business over time, result in an
increase in our compliance costs, including higher FDIC insurance premiums, and may affect our ability to attract and retain qualified executive officers and employees
(especially when compared to competitors not subject to similar restrictions). Further, the stringency of the regulatory framework that applies to us may increase as
our asset size and international business grows.

A change in applicable statutes, regulations or regulatory policies, including the possibility of legislative, regulatory and policy changes by the U.S Congress
and/or Biden-Harris Administration, could have a material adverse effect on our business, including limiting or imposing conditions on the types of financial services
and products we may offer or increasing the ability of nonbanks to offer competing financial services and products. Increased regulatory requirements (and the
associated compliance costs), whether due to the growth of our business, the adoption of new laws and regulations, changes in existing laws and regulations, or more
expansive or aggressive enforcement of existing laws and regulations, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
In addition, personnel part of or appointed by the Biden-Harris Administration may take new or different positions than their predecessors and that could result in
additional regulatory requirements or requirements to change certain practices.

In 2021, we exceeded $100 billion of average total consolidated assets (over four quarters). We are now subject to more stringent regulations, including certain
enhanced prudential standards applicable to large bank holding companies. If we exceed $250 billion of average total consolidated assets, we will be subject to
even more stringent regulations.

Certain enhanced prudential standards and related requirements now apply to us, as we have exceeded $100 billion in average total consolidated assets
calculated over four consecutive financial quarters. We are now a Category IV institution under the Tailoring Rules, and therefore are subject to additional
requirements, such as certain enhanced prudential standards and monitoring and reporting certain risk-based indicators. Under the Tailoring Rules, Category IV firms
are, among other things, subject to (1) supervisory capital stress testing on a biennial basis, (2) requirements to develop and maintain a capital plan on an annual basis
and (3) certain liquidity risk management and risk committee requirements, including liquidity buffer and liquidity stress testing requirements. As a result, we now
face more stringent regulatory requirements and limitations on our business, as well as increased compliance costs.

As of year-end 2021, we had total consolidated assets of $211.5 billion. If we exceed $250 billion of average total consolidated assets, or exceed $75 billion in
weighted short-term wholesale funding, nonbank assets, or off-balance sheet exposures, we will be subject to even more stringent regulations as a Category III
institution. Category III institutions are additionally subject to, among other requirements, biennial company-run stress testing, supervisory capital stress testing on an
annual basis, and increased capital and liquidity requirements.

Depending on our levels of capital and liquidity, stress test results and other factors, we may be limited in the types of activities we may conduct and be limited
as to how we utilize our capital, including with respect to common stock repurchases. Further, we may be subject to heightened expectations, which could result in
additional regulatory scrutiny, higher penalties, and more severe consequences if we are unable to meet those expectations. See <Business-Supervision and
Regulation-Enhanced Prudential Standards,= under this Part I, Item 1, for a more detailed description of the various requirements that are applicable to us.

We face a risk of noncompliance and enforcement action with the Bank Secrecy Act, other anti-money laundering and anti-bribery statutes and regulations, and
U.S. economic and trade sanctions.

The Bank Secrecy Act, the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020, and other laws and regulations require financial institutions to,
among other duties, institute and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate.
The federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and has engaged in
coordinated enforcement efforts with state and federal banking regulators, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice and IRS. We also must comply with U.S. economic
and trade sanctions administered by the U.S. Treasury Department9s Office of Foreign Assets Control and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and we, like other
financial institutions, are subject to increased scrutiny for compliance with these requirements. We maintain policies, procedures and systems designed to detect and
deter prohibited financing activities. However, if these controls were deemed deficient or fail to prevent wrongdoing, we could be subject to liability, including civil
fines and regulatory actions, which may include restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain
aspects of our business plan. In addition, any failure to effectively maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing
could have serious reputational consequences for us. Any of these results could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of
operations.

If we were to violate, or fail to comply with, international, federal or state laws or regulations governing financial institutions, we could be subject to disciplinary
action that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation.

International, federal and state banking regulators possess broad powers to take supervisory or enforcement action with respect to financial institutions. Other
regulatory bodies, including the SEC, FINRA and state securities regulators, regulate investment advisers and broker-dealers, including our subsidiaries, SVB Asset
Management, SVB Wealth Advisory, SVB Securities and Boston Private Wealth. These laws and regulations are highly complex, and if we were to violate, even if
unintentionally or inadvertently, regulatory authorities could take various actions against us, such as imposing restrictions on how we conduct our business, imposing
higher capital and liquidity requirements, requiring us to maintain higher insurance levels, revoking necessary licenses or authorizations, imposing censures, significant
civil money penalties or fines, issuing cease and desist or other supervisory orders, and suspending or expelling us or any of our employees from certain businesses.
For example, we could face material restrictions on our activities and our ability to enter into certain transactions if SVB Financial and the Bank cease to maintain their
status as well-capitalized or well-managed as defined under the Federal Reserve9s Regulation Y. These enforcement actions could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation.

Laws and regulations regarding the handling of personal data and information may impede our services or result in increased costs, legal claims or fines against us.

We are subject to an evolving body of federal, state and non-U.S. laws, regulations, guidelines and principles regarding data privacy and security, including the
protection of personal information. Legal requirements relating to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer and security of personal data continue to
evolve, and regulatory scrutiny in this area is increasing around the world. Significant uncertainty exists as privacy and data protection laws may be interpreted and
applied differently from country to country and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements. For example, the GDPR extends the scope of the European Union
data protection law to all companies processing data of EU residents, regardless of location, while the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA") established new
requirements regarding handling of personal data to entities serving or employing California residents, and such requirements will be expanded under the California
Privacy Rights Act ("CPRA") once it goes into effect on January 1, 2023. The GDPR, CCPA and CPRA have heightened our privacy compliance obligations and require us
to evaluate our current operations, IT systems and data handling practices and implement changes where necessary to comply, with associated costs. Our failure to
comply with any such laws, or the failure of our current operations, IT systems and data handling practices to prevent breaches involving personal data, may result in
significant liabilities and/or reputational harm. See <Business-Supervision and Regulation-Privacy and Cybersecurity,= under this Part I, Item 1, for a more detailed
description of the various consumer privacy laws that are applicable to us.

Adverse results from litigation or governmental or regulatory investigations can impact our business practices and operating results.

We are currently involved in certain legal proceedings, and may from time to time be involved in governmental or regulatory investigations and inquiries relating
to matters that arise in connection with the conduct of our business. While we have not recognized a material accrual liability for any lawsuits and claims filed or
pending against us to date, the outcome of litigation and other legal and regulatory matters is inherently uncertain and it is possible that the actual results of one or
more of such matters may be substantially higher than the amounts reserved, or that judgments may be rendered, or fines or penalties assessed in matters for which
we have no reserves. Further, adverse outcomes in lawsuits or investigations may result in significant monetary damages, admissions of guilt or injunctive relief that
may adversely affect our operating results

or financial condition as well as our ability to conduct our businesses (or one or more business lines) as they are presently being conducted, including our ability to
make certain acquisitions or otherwise expand our businesses. Any such resolution of a criminal matter involving us or our employees could lead to increased
exposure to civil litigation and overlapping government investigations, could adversely affect our reputation, could result in penalties or limitations on our ability to
conduct our activities generally or in certain circumstances and could have other negative effects. These matters also include responding to governmental inquiries
regarding our customers. In recent years across the financial services industry, a number of investigations of customers have, based on the circumstances, led to
investigations of the particular bank and its policies.

Moreover, even if we prevail in such actions, litigation and investigations can cause reputational harm and be costly and time-consuming, and often risk diverting
the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

A failure to appropriately identify and address potential conflicts of interest could adversely affect our businesses.

Due to the broad scope of our businesses, we regularly address potential conflicts of interest, including situations where our services to a particular client or our
own investments or other interests conflict, or are perceived to conflict, with the interests of that client or another client, as well as situations where one or more of
our businesses have access to material non-public information that may not be shared with our other businesses and situations where we may be a creditor of an
entity with which we also have an advisory or other relationship. For example, SVB Securities provides investment banking services to clients in the healthcare and
technology industry, some of which may also be clients or potential clients of the Bank. Additionally, SVB Financial from time to time may enter into hedging
arrangements in respect of investments made in connection with SVB Capital9s business, meaning that we may maintain some short positions on SVB Capital funds, or
the positions of clients or potential clients of the Bank. In addition, we invest in and partner with entities in the innovation economy, some of which may be clients or
potential clients of the Bank. These types of potential conflicts have increased with our acquisition of Boston Private and the related expansion in our private bank
business as well as our investments through our SVB Capital business.

We have procedures and controls designed to identify and address these conflicts of interest, including those designed to prevent the improper sharing of
information among our businesses. However, appropriately identifying and dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult, and our reputation could be
damaged and the willingness of clients to enter into transactions with us may be affected if we fail, or appear to fail, to identify, disclose and deal appropriately with
conflicts of interest. In addition, potential or perceived conflicts could give rise to litigation or regulatory enforcement actions.

Anti-takeover provisions and federal laws, particularly those applicable to financial institutions, may limit the ability of another party to acquire us, which could
prevent a merger or acquisition that may be attractive to stockholders and/or have a material adverse effect on our stock price.

As a bank holding company, we are subject to certain laws that could delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us. The Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as
amended, and the Change in Bank Control Act of 1978, as amended, together with federal and state regulations, require that, depending on the particular
circumstances, either the Federal Reserve must approve or, after receiving notice, must not object to any person or entity acquiring <control= (as determined under
the Federal Reserve9s standards) of a bank holding company, such as SVB Financial, or a state member bank, such as the Bank. In addition, DFPI approval may be
required in connection with the acquisition of control of the Bank. Moreover, certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and certain other actions
we may take or have taken could delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us. Any of these laws, regulations and other provisions may prevent a merger or
acquisition that would be attractive to stockholders and could limit the price investors would be willing to pay in the future for our common stock.

Strategic, Reputational and Other Risks

Concentration of risk increases the potential for significant losses, while the establishment of limits to mitigate concentration risk increases the potential for lower
revenues and slower growth.

Our focus on certain markets or segments, including those by client industry, life-cycle stage, size and geography, increases the potential for significant losses
due to concentration of risk. It may also result in lower revenues or slower growth if we choose to limit growth in certain markets or segments to mitigate
concentration risk. While there may exist a great deal of diversity within each industry, our clients are concentrated within the following general industries:
technology, life science and healthcare, private equity and venture capital and premium wine. Clients of our private banking division are primarily executive leaders
and senior investment professionals in the innovation economy, as well as high net worth clients acquired from Boston Private. In particular, our technology clients
generally tend to be in the industries of hardware (such as semiconductors, communications, data storage and electronics), software/internet (such as infrastructure
software, applications, software services, digital content and advertising technology), and climate technology and sustainability. Our life

31
Table of Contents

science and healthcare clients are concentrated in the industries of biopharma, healthtech, medical devices, healthcare services and diagnostics and tools. Many of
our client companies are also concentrated by certain stages within their life cycles, such as early-stage, mid-stage or later-stage and many of these companies are
venture capital-backed. In addition, growth prospects and our geographic focus on key domestic and international innovation markets, as well as premium wine
markets, may lead to an increase in our concentration risk. Our loan concentrations are derived from our borrowers engaging in similar activities as well as certain
types of loans extended to a diverse group of borrowers that could cause those borrowers to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions. Any adverse
effect on any of our areas of concentration could have a material impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition, even when economic and
market conditions are generally favorable to our competitors that are not exposed to similar concentration risk.

Decreases in the amount of equity capital available to our clients could adversely affect our business, growth and profitability.

Our core strategy is focused on providing banking and financial products and services to companies, investors, entrepreneurs and influencers in the innovation
economy, including in particular to early-stage and mid-stage companies that receive financial support from sophisticated investors, including venture capital or
private equity firms, <angels,= corporate investors, crowd-funding and other evolving sources of capital. We derive a meaningful share of our deposits from these
companies and provide them with loans as well as other banking products and services. In some cases, our lending credit decision is based on our analysis of the
likelihood that our client will receive additional rounds of equity capital from investors or other funding sources. Among the factors that have affected and could in the
future affect the amount of capital available to our clients are: the receptivity of the capital markets; the prevalence of public equity offerings or M&A activity
(primarily among companies within the technology and life science and healthcare industry sectors); the availability and return on alternative investments; economic
conditions in the technology, life science and healthcare and private equity/venture capital industries; and overall general economic conditions. Reduced capital
markets valuations could also reduce the amount of capital available to our client companies, including companies within our technology and life science and
healthcare industry sectors. If the amount of capital available to such companies decreases, it is likely that the number of our new clients and investor financial
support to our existing clients could decrease, which could have an adverse effect on our business, profitability and growth prospects.

We face competitive pressures that could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition or growth.

We compete with other banks as well as specialty and diversified financial services companies and investment, debt, venture capital and private equity funds,
some of which are larger than we are and which may offer a broader range of lending, leasing, payments, foreign currency exchange, and other financial products and
advisory services to our client base. We also compete with other alternative and more specialized lenders, such as online <marketplace= lenders, peer-to-peer lenders
and other non-traditional lenders that have emerged in recent years.

Moreover, we compete with fintech and non-financial services companies, many of which offer bank or bank-like products, specialized services involving the
elimination of banks as intermediaries (known as <disintermediation=) and/or the unbundling of banking products and services into point solutions. The activity of
fintechs and support of fintechs by venture capital firms has increased significantly in recent years and are expected to continue to increase. For example, a number of
fintechs have applied for, and in some cases received, bank or industrial loan charters or have partnered with existing banks to allow them to offer deposit products to
their customers. There has also been significant fintech activity in the areas of credit cards, payments, foreign exchange and lending. Regulatory changes, such as the
December 2020 revisions to the FDIC9s rules on brokered deposits, may also make it easier for fintechs to partner with banks and offer deposit products. In addition,
some traditional technology companies are beginning to provide financial services directly to their customers and are expected to continue to explore new ways to do
so. Many of these companies have fewer regulatory constraints than we do, and some have lower cost structures. Some of these companies also have greater
resources to invest in technological improvements than we currently have and may be able to better recruit technology talent.

Our competitors may focus their marketing efforts on industry sectors that we serve; for example, they may seek to increase their lending and other financial
relationships with technology companies or special industries such as wineries. When new competitors seek to enter one of our markets, or when existing market
participants seek to increase their market share, they sometimes undercut the pricing and/or credit terms prevalent in that market, which could adversely affect our
market share or ability to exploit new market opportunities. We may have to agree to accept less attractive credit, pricing and other investment terms if we act to
meet these competitive challenges, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and future growth. Similarly, competitive
pressures and market disruption could adversely affect our access to capital and attractive investment opportunities for our funds business.

Our ability to maintain or increase our market share depends on our ability to attract and maintain, as well as meet the needs of, existing and future clients.

32
Table of Contents

Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to maintain or increase our market share. In particular, much of our success depends on our ability to attract early-
stage or start-up companies as clients and to retain those companies as clients as they grow and mature successfully through the various stages of their life cycles. As a
result, we adapt our products and services to evolving industry standards as well as introduce new products and services beyond industry standards in order to serve
our clients, who are innovators themselves. A failure to achieve market acceptance for any new products or services we introduce, a failure to introduce products or
services that the market demands, or the costs associated with developing, introducing and providing new products and services could have an adverse effect on our
business, results of operations, growth prospects and financial condition.

We face risks in connection with our strategic undertakings and new business initiatives.

We are engaged, and may in the future engage, in strategic activities domestically or internationally (including the acquisitions of Boston Private and
MoffettNathanson LLC), joint ventures, partnerships, investments or other business growth initiatives or undertakings. There can be no assurance that we will
successfully identify appropriate opportunities, that we will be able to negotiate or finance such activities or that such activities, if undertaken, will be successful.

We are focused on our long-term growth and have undertaken various strategic activities and business initiatives, many of which involve activities that are new
to us or, in some cases, are experimental in nature. For example, we are expanding our global presence and may engage in activities in jurisdictions where we have
limited experience from a business, legal and/or regulatory perspective. With the acquisition of Leerink Holdings LLC, now known as SVB Securities, we have also
expanded into new lines of business, namely, investment banking and M&A advisory services. In support of SVB Securities continued expansion into technology
investment banking, we have continued to grow the investment banking team to deepen our expertise in the technology sector and acquired MoffettNathanson LLC in
December 2021 to expand our equity research coverage to include companies in the technology industry. Moreover, our acquisition of Boston Private significantly
expanded our wealth management and private banking business and introduced new lines of lending and new deposit products, new types of customers and a
number of bank branches. For example, the Boston Private acquisition included a portfolio of commercial real estate loans, which expose us to various risks, including
potential environmental liability, if we were to acquire a property, through foreclosure or other similar proceedings, that had material environmental violations.
Additionally, in February 2022 we launched our first open-ended fund sponsored by SVB Financial to hold investments in other open-ended funds. We are also
enhancing and expanding our payments processing capabilities and digital platforms to better serve our clients, including developing new electronic payment
processing solutions, and supporting new or evolving disruptive payments systems and services (including providing embedded payments services to enable clients to
process payments on behalf of their own clients, e.g., merchant services and custodial account services). We may also serve clients that deal with new or evolving
industries or business activities, such as digital currencies and cannabis. Given our evolving geographic and product diversification, and our innovative product
solutions, these initiatives may subject us to, among other risks, increased business, reputational and operational risk, as well as more complex payment system rules
and legal, regulatory and compliance costs and risks.

Our ability to execute strategic activities and new business initiatives successfully, as well as expand and grow our existing capabilities (such as the acquisitions of
Boston Private and MoffettNathanson LLC) will depend on a variety of factors. These factors likely will vary based on the nature of the activity but may include our
success in integrating an acquired company or a new internally developed growth initiative into our business, operations, services, products, personnel and systems,
operating effectively with any partner with whom we elect to do business, meeting applicable regulatory requirements and obtaining applicable regulatory licenses or
other approvals, hiring or retaining key employees, retaining clients, attracting new clients, achieving anticipated synergies, meeting management9s expectations,
realizing the anticipated benefits of the activities, and overall general market conditions. Our ability to address these matters successfully cannot be assured.
Additionally, macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties and challenges may adversely impact our ability to execute our strategic undertakings. Moreover, our
strategic efforts may divert resources or management9s attention from ongoing business operations and may subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and potential
liability. If we do not successfully execute a strategic undertaking, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, reputation or growth
prospects. In addition, if we were to conclude that the value of an acquired business had decreased and that the related goodwill had been impaired, that conclusion
would result in an impairment of goodwill charge to us, which would adversely affect our results of operations. We may also be required to make unanticipated capital
expenditures or investments in order to maintain, improve or sustain the acquired operations or take write-offs or impairment charges and may be subject to
unanticipated or unknown liabilities relating to an acquisition.

In addition, in order to finance future strategic undertakings, we might require additional financing, which might not be available on terms favorable to us, or at
all. If obtained, equity financing could be dilutive and the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations or financial condition.

We may fail to realize the growth prospects and other benefits anticipated as a result of the Boston Private acquisition.

The success of the Boston Private acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated business opportunities and growth prospects from the
acquisition. We may not realize all of these business opportunities and growth prospects. The Boston Private acquisition required significant efforts and expenditures,
as will the related integration that is currently underway. Our management might have its attention diverted while trying to integrate operations and corporate and
administrative infrastructures and the cost of integration may exceed our expectations. In 2021, we incurred approximately $129 million of merger-related charges in
connection with the transaction. We may also be required to make unanticipated capital expenditures or investments in order to maintain, improve or sustain the
acquired operations or take write-offs or impairment charges and may be subject to unanticipated or unknown liabilities relating to the Boston Private acquisition. In
addition, the success of the Boston Private acquisition will depend in part on our ability to continue to retain Boston Private9s employees and clients. If we are unable,
for any reason, to retain key employees or clients, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction.

If any of these factors limit our ability to complete the integration of operations successfully or on a timely basis, our expectations of future results of operations
might not be met. In addition, it is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of ongoing businesses, tax costs or
inefficiencies, or inconsistencies in standards, controls, IT systems, procedures and policies, any of which could adversely affect our ability to achieve the anticipated
benefits of the Boston Private acquisition and could harm our financial performance.

Our business reputation and relationships are important and any damage to them could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Our reputation is very important in sustaining our business and we rely on our relationships with our current, former and potential clients and stockholders, the
venture capital and private equity communities, and other actors in the industries that we serve. Any damage to our reputation, whether arising from regulatory,
supervisory or enforcement actions, matters affecting our financial reporting or compliance with SEC and exchange listing requirements, negative publicity, the way in
which we conduct our business (including with respect to the administration of PPP forgiveness applications, our actions related to environmental, social and
governance matters, or potential hedging arrangements) or otherwise, could strain our existing relationships and make it difficult for us to develop new relationships.
Additionally, negative publicity regarding the industries that we focus on serving (for example, technology, private equity or venture capital) may also damage our
reputation. Any such damage to our reputation and relationships could in turn lead to a material adverse effect on our business.

Whereas negative public opinion once was primarily driven by adverse news coverage in traditional media, the widespread use of social media platforms
facilitates the rapid dissemination of information or misinformation, which magnifies the potential harm to our reputation. In addition, the behavior of our employees,
including with respect to our employees9 use of social media, subjects us to potential negative publicity if such behavior does not align with our high standards of
integrity or fails to comply with regulations or accepted practices

An ineffective risk management framework could have a material adverse effect on our strategic planning and our ability to mitigate risks and/or losses and could
have adverse regulatory consequences.

We have implemented a risk management framework to identify and manage our risk exposure. This framework is comprised of various processes, systems and
strategies, and is designed to manage the types of risk to which we are subject, including, among others, credit, market, liquidity, operational, capital, compliance,
strategic and reputational risks. Our framework also includes financial, analytical, forecasting or other modeling methodologies, which involve management
assumptions and judgment. In addition, our Board of Directors, in consultation with management, has adopted a risk appetite statement, which sets forth certain
thresholds and limits to govern our overall risk profile. However, there is no assurance that our risk management framework, including the risk metrics under our risk
appetite statement, or use of related risk mitigation techniques, such as hedging arrangements, will be effective under all circumstances or that they will adequately
identify, manage or mitigate any risk or loss to us. If our risk management framework is not effective, we could suffer unexpected losses and become subject to
regulatory consequences, as a result of which our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected. As we
continue to grow and expand our business, we will need to evolve our risk management framework to support the size and complexity of the Company. Failure to
adequately evolve our risk management framework may have adverse consequences on our business.

We do not currently pay dividends on shares of our common stock and may not do so in the future.

Holders of shares of our capital stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such
payments. We do not currently pay dividends on our common stock and have no current plans to do so. Furthermore, the terms of our outstanding preferred stock
prohibit us from declaring or paying any dividends on any junior series of our capital stock, including our common stock, or from repurchasing, redeeming or acquiring
such

34
Table of Contents

junior stock, unless we have declared and paid full dividends on our outstanding preferred stock for the most recently completed dividend period. We are also subject
to statutory and regulatory limitations on our ability to pay dividends on our capital stock. If we are unable to satisfy the capital requirements applicable to us for any
reason, we may be limited in our ability to declare and pay dividends on our capital stock.

General Risk Factors

If we fail to retain key employees or recruit new employees, or if we are unable to effectively manage the growth of our employee base, our growth and results of
operations could be adversely affected.

We rely on key personnel, including a substantial number of employees who have technical expertise in their subject matter area and a strong network of
relationships with individuals and institutions in the markets we serve. In addition, as we expand into international markets, we will need to hire local personnel within
those markets. Further, competition for key personnel is substantial and may increase, particularly if new competitors seek to enter one of our markets or existing
market participants seek to increase their market share. If we were to have less success in recruiting and retaining these employees than our competitors, for reasons
including domestic or foreign regulatory restrictions on compensation practices, inflationary pressures on wages, inability to effectively address issues related to
human capital management, or the availability of more attractive opportunities elsewhere, our growth and results of operations could be adversely affected. In
addition, we have experienced meaningful growth in our employee base in recent years. Further, our performance may be adversely impacted if we are unable to
effectively manage succession planning for key employees, as well as transitions and knowledge transfers related to key employee departures. The number of our FTEs
increased from 4,461 at December 31, 2020 to 6,567 at December 31, 2021, and is expected to continue to increase through our organic growth. If this growth places
strain on our operations, corporate culture or human capital management practices, or if we are unable to adequately integrate new employees or to maintain
employee satisfaction, our growth and results of operations could be adversely impacted.

Moreover, equity awards are an important component of our compensation program, especially for our executive officers and other members of senior
management. The extent of shares available for grant in connection with such equity awards pursuant to our incentive compensation plans is generally subject to
stockholder approval. If we do not have sufficient shares to grant to existing or new employees, there could be an adverse effect on our recruiting and retention
efforts, which could impact our growth and results of operations.

If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results. As a result,
current and potential holders of our securities could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our
securities.

Maintaining and adapting our internal controls over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and related rules and regulations
of the SEC, can be costly and require significant management attention. As we continue to grow or acquire additional businesses, our internal controls may become
more complex and require additional resources to ensure they remain effective amidst dynamic regulatory and other guidance. Failure to maintain effective controls
or implement required new or improved controls or difficulties encountered in the process may harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting
obligations. If we or our independent registered accounting firm identify material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting or if we are otherwise
required to restate our financial statements, we could be required to implement costly and time-consuming remedial measures and could lose investor confidence in
the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports. We may also face regulatory enforcement or other actions, including the potential delisting of our common
stock from the NASDAQ Stock Market. This could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, as well as the trading price of our
securities, and could potentially subject us to litigation.

Changes in accounting standards could materially impact our financial statements.

From time to time, the FASB or the SEC may change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements.
Also, our global initiatives, as well as continuing trends towards the convergence of international accounting standards, such as rules that may be adopted under the
IFRS, may result in our Company being subject to new or changing accounting and reporting standards. In addition, the bodies that interpret the accounting standards
(such as banking regulators or external auditors) may change their interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied. These changes may be
beyond our control, can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition or results of operations. In some cases, we
could be required to apply a new or revised standard retrospectively, or apply an existing standard differently, also retrospectively, in each case resulting in our
revising or restating prior period financial statements.

We could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretations.

We are subject to the income tax laws of the United States, its constituent states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we have
business operations. These tax laws are complex and may be subject to different

35
Table of Contents

interpretations. We must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining our provision for income
taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and our valuation allowance. Changes to tax laws and regulations by the Biden-Harris Administration and the U.S.
Congress, administrative rulings or court decisions could increase our provision for income taxes and reduce our net income.

We rely on quantitative models to measure risks and to estimate certain financial values.

Quantitative models may be used to help manage certain aspects of our business and to assist with certain business decisions, including estimating credit losses,
measuring the fair value of financial instruments when reliable market prices are unavailable, estimating the effects of changing interest rates and other market
measures on our financial condition and results of operations, and managing risk. However, all models have certain limitations. For example, our measurement
methodologies rely on many assumptions, historical analyses and correlations. These assumptions may not capture or fully incorporate conditions leading to losses,
particularly in times of market distress, and the historical correlations on which we rely may no longer be relevant. Additionally, as businesses and markets evolve, our
measurements may not accurately reflect the changing environment. Further, even if the underlying assumptions and historical correlations used in our models are
adequate, our models may be deficient due to errors in computer code, bad data, misuse of data, or the use of a model for a purpose outside the scope of the model9s
design. Although we employ strategies to manage and govern the risks associated with our use of models, they may not be effective or fully reliable. As a result, our
models may not capture or fully express the risks we face, suggest that we have sufficient capitalization when we do not, lead us to misjudge the business and
economic environment in which we operate and ultimately cause planning failures or the reporting of incorrect information to our regulators. Any such occurrence or
the perception of such occurrence by our regulators, investors or clients could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
operations or reputation.

The price of our capital stock may be volatile or may decline.

The trading price of our capital stock may fluctuate or be adversely affected as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside our control, including
trading volumes that affect the market prices of the shares of many companies. Factors that could affect the trading price of our capital stock include:

" actual or anticipated quarterly fluctuations in our operating results and financial condition;
" changes in revenue or earnings estimates or publication of research reports and recommendations by financial analysts;
" failure to meet analysts9 revenue or earnings estimates;
" speculation in the press or investment community;
" strategic actions by us or our competitors;
" actions by institutional stockholders;
" fluctuations in the stock price and operating results of our competitors;
" general market conditions and, in particular, developments related to market conditions for the financial services industry including as a result of current or
anticipated military conflict, terrorism or other geopolitical events;
" actual or anticipated changes in interest rates;
" market perceptions about the innovation economy, including levels of funding or <exit= activities of companies in the industries we serve;
" proposed or adopted regulatory changes or developments;
" anticipated or pending investigations, proceedings or litigation that involve or affect us; and
" domestic and international economic factors, including inflation, unrelated to our performance.
The trading price of the shares of our common stock and depositary shares representing fractional interests in our preferred stock and the value of our other
securities will further depend on many factors, which may change from time to time, including, without limitation, our financial condition, performance,
creditworthiness and prospects, and future sales of our equity or equity-related securities. In some cases, the markets have produced downward pressure on trading
prices of capital stock and credit availability for certain issuers without regard to those issuers9 underlying financial strength. A significant decline in the trading price of
our capital stock could result in substantial losses for individual stockholders and could lead to costly and disruptive securities litigation, as well as the loss of key
employees.

Our capital stock is subordinate to our existing and future indebtedness.

Our capital stock, including our common stock and depositary shares representing fractional interests in our preferred stock, ranks junior to all of SVB Financial9s
existing and future indebtedness and other non-equity claims with respect to assets available to satisfy claims against us, including claims in the event of our
liquidation. We may incur additional indebtedness in

36

the future to increase our capital resources or if our total capital ratio or the total capital ratio of the Bank falls below the required minimums. Furthermore, our
common stock is subordinate to our outstanding preferred stock.

Overview of Company Operations

SVB Financial is a diversified financial services company, as well as a bank holding company and a financial holding company. SVB Financial was incorporated in
the state of Delaware in March 1999. Through our various subsidiaries and divisions, we offer a variety of banking and financial products and services. For nearly 40
years, we have been dedicated to helping innovative companies and their investors succeed, especially in the technology, life science/healthcare, private
equity/venture capital and premium wine industries. We provide our clients of all sizes and stages with a diverse set of products and services to support them through
all stages of their life cycles, and key innovation markets around the world.

We offer commercial and private banking products and services through our principal subsidiary, the Bank, which is a California-state chartered bank founded in
1983 and a member of the Federal Reserve System. Through its subsidiaries, the Bank also offers asset management, private wealth management and other
investment services. In addition, through SVB Financial's other subsidiaries and divisions, we also offer investment banking services and non-banking products and
services, such as funds management, M&A advisory services and venture capital and private equity investment.

Management9s Overview of 2021 Financial Performance

2021 was an exceptional year as we delivered record EPS of $31.25, net income of $1.8 billion and a return on equity of 17 percent. Continuing where we left off
in 2020, our balance sheet growth offset pressure from the low rate environment which drove net interest income to a 47 percent increase from 2020. During the
year, we also saw higher core fee income, strong investment banking revenue and outsized gains related to robust exit and fundraising activity which drove warrant
exercises and improved valuations, all of which helped raise noninterest income by 49 percent from 2020. As a result of our strong results for 2021, compensation and
benefits expense increased primarily driven by higher incentive compensation plan expense as we rewarded our historic results for the year.

During 2021, we continued to execute on our strategic vision, extending and diversifying our business and geographical footprint to support our clients as they
grow to ensure we remain the partner of choice for innovators, enterprises, entrepreneurs and investors around the world. In the third quarter, we completed our
acquisition of Boston Private to accelerate the growth and capabilities of our private bank and wealth management strategy. We also announced a joint venture with
Nasdaq and a consortium of leading investment banks to create Nasdaq Private Market, an institutional-grade, secondary trading venue for private company stock.
Throughout 2021, we hired over 100 investment bankers to expand our Healthcare Services and HealthTech investment banking practices and to launch our new
Technology investment banking services. As part of this expansion, we also announced our acquisition of MoffettNathanson to add technology equity research
capabilities. Lastly, we continued to make investments in our infrastructure and regulatory groups to support our tremendous growth as we became a Category IV
banking organization and now prepare to potentially become a Category III banking organization. Overall, the investments in our systems, infrastructure and processes
are intended to support our continued growth and increased needs of our clients and employees.

To support our continued balance sheet growth, we accessed the capital markets several times during 2021. During the year, we issued $3.4 billion of preferred
stock, $2.4 billion of common stock (excluding $1.1 billion of shares issued to complete the Boston Private acquisition) and $1.7 billion of long-term debt. These
issuances combined with our strong earnings for the year enabled us to further support our already strong capital ratios and maintain our growth momentum in the
near term while allowing us to invest for the long-term.

Recent Developments - COVID-19

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in unprecedented challenges and volatility in economic, market and business conditions. It has caused significant economic
and financial disruptions that have adversely affected or otherwise impacted our business, financial condition and results of operations.

During the year ended 2021, the economy continued to generally improve with increased vaccine rates and business activity. However, there still remains much
uncertainty around containment of the pandemic and the trajectory of the broader economic recovery, particularly in light of the spread of variants of the COVID-19
virus, including the Omicron variant. Variants have contributed to the significant increase in the number of cases in the United States and other international locations
where we operate. We cannot predict at this time the scope and duration of the pandemic, which will depend on a variety of factors, including but not limited to, the
extent and spread of the Omicron variant and other variants of the virus; the availability, adoption and efficacy of vaccines and vaccine booster shots, as well as
government and other actions to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, such as stay at home orders, vaccination mandates, restrictions on business activities, health and
safety guidelines, economic relief for individuals and businesses, and monetary policy measures. The economic, market and business conditions impacted by COVID-19
may be slow to recover or may worsen if the pandemic continues for a prolonged period of time. Even if the pandemic subsides, there may be additional variants of
the virus or a resurgence of the pandemic, as we have seen domestically and internationally. We continue to be subject to heightened business, operational (including
fraud), market, credit and other risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic environment, which may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations. (See <Risk Factors= under Part I, Item 1A of this report).

Although the effects of the pandemic remain uncertain, for the year ending 2022, we currently expect strong growth in average on-balance sheet deposits,
average loans, net interest income, core fees, SVB Securities revenue and an improved outlook for net loan charge-offs to average loans. While credit metrics have
been stable to date, we continue to monitor our portfolio vigilantly, in light of continued economic uncertainty, including inflationary trends and interest rate volatility
and fading government stimulus. Additionally, volatile equity markets, IPO and M&A activity may impact investment banking and market-sensitive revenues affecting
our 2022 outlook. Even after the pandemic subsides, it is possible that the U.S. and other major economies may experience a prolonged recession, which could
materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, capital and results of operations.

Reference Rate Reform

The publication of the British Pound Sterling, Euro, Swiss Franc and Japanese Yen LIBOR settings and one-week and two-month U.S. dollar LIBOR settings
terminated at the end of December 2021, leaving the remaining U.S. dollar LIBOR settings (i.e., overnight, one month, three month, six month and 12 month) in place
which are expected to terminate at the end of June 2023. Therefore, existing contracts referencing all other U.S. dollar LIBOR settings must be remediated no later
than June 30, 2023. We hold instruments that may be impacted by the discontinuance of LIBOR, including loans, investments, and derivative products that use LIBOR
as a benchmark rate.

Our LIBOR Transition Program consists of dedicated leadership and staff, and continues to engage with relevant business lines and support groups. As part of this
program, we continue to identify, assess, and monitor risks associated with the discontinuation of LIBOR, including monitoring the population of loans and contracts
that are impacted and how LIBOR reference rates are reflected in our measurement of sensitivity to changes in interest rates until publication of LIBOR rates are fully
phased out. We ceased offering U.S. dollar LIBOR-based loans effective December 31, 2021. We completed a review across all business lines and confirmed that
language to facilitate a transition to an alternative reference rate is included in our existing deals that carry LIBOR exposure. Migration of legacy LIBOR contracts has
commenced based on regulatory timelines, with proactive remediation conducted for existing LIBOR facilities that contained currencies tied to LIBOR rates that ceased
publication as of December 31, 2021. A communications and training plan supports the delivery of new Alternative Reference Rate (<ARR=) products and assists with
the transition away from LIBOR.

We have adopted SOFR as our preferred replacement index for U.S. dollar LIBOR and received Term SOFR licensing from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in the
fourth quarter of 2021. We currently offer products based on Alternative Reference Rates across multiple currencies including the U.S. Dollar, British Pound Sterling,
and Euro.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our accounting policies are fundamental to understanding our financial condition and results of operations and are discussed in Note 24<Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies= of the <Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements= under Part II, Item 8 of this report. We have identified one policy as being
critical because it requires us to make particularly difficult, subjective and/or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain, and because it is likely
that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an
ongoing basis and we base these estimates on historical experiences and various other factors and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

This critical accounting policy addresses the adequacy of the ACL for loans and unfunded credit commitments. Our senior management has discussed and
reviewed the development, selection, application and disclosure of this critical accounting policy with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The following is a
brief discussion of our critical accounting estimate and related policy.

Allowance for Credit Losses

We consider this accounting policy to be critical as estimation of ECL involves material management estimates and is susceptible to significant changes in the
near-term. Determining the ACL for loans and unfunded credit commitments requires us to make forecasts that are highly uncertain and require a high degree of
judgment. A committee comprised of senior management evaluates the adequacy of the ACL for loans, which includes review of loan portfolio segmentation,
quantitative models, internal and external data inputs, economic forecasts, credit risk ratings and qualitative adjustments.

Expected Credit Losses Estimate for Loans and Unfunded Credit Commitments

The methodology for estimating the amount of ECL reported in the ACL is the sum of two main components: (1) ECL assessed on a collective basis for pools of
loans and unfunded credit commitments that share similar risk characteristics and (2) ECL assessed for individual loans and unfunded credit commitments that do not
share similar risk characteristics with other loans. Estimating the amount of ECL involves significant judgment on various matters including the assessment of risk
characteristics, assignment of risk ratings, development and weighting of macroeconomic forecasts, and incorporation of historical loss experience.

We derive an estimate of ECL using three predictive metrics: (1) probability of default ("PD"), (2) loss given default ("LGD") and (3) exposure at default ("EAD"),
over the estimated life of the exposure. PD and LGD assumptions are developed based on quantitative models and inherent risk of credit loss, both of which involve
significant judgment.

One of the most significant areas of judgment involved in estimating the ACL relates to the macroeconomic forecasts used to estimate credit losses. To the
extent the remaining contractual lives of loans in the portfolio extend beyond our three-year forecast period, we revert to historical averages using primarily an
autoregressive method of mean reversion that will continue to gradually trend towards the mean historical loss over the remaining contractual lives of loans, adjusted
for prepayments. The macroeconomic scenarios are reviewed on a quarterly basis.

The selection of variables used in our econometric models varies by loan portfolio, but typically includes real gross domestic product ("GDP") growth,
unemployment rates, Housing Price Index ("HPI") changes and BBB corporate bond spread.

Changes in management9s assumptions and macroeconomic forecasts could significantly affect the estimate of ECL. For example, macroeconomic conditions and
forecasts related to the duration and severity of the economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have been rapidly changing and continue to remain
uncertain. Alternative assumptions could have significant impact on the ECL. However, changing one assumption without reassessing other assumptions used in the
quantitative or qualitative process could yield results that are not reasonable or appropriate. Our ECL models were designed to capture the correlation between
economic conditions and historical portfolio changes. As such, evaluating shifts in individual variables in isolation may not be indicative of past or future performance.

Table of Contents

Given the range of the most significant macroeconomic variables in the upside, or stronger near-term growth, and downside, or moderate recession, scenarios of
our forecast used to develop the ECL as of December 31, 2021, our portfolio reserve coverage ranges from 0.49 percent to 0.76 percent, with a funded reserve rate of
0.64 percent as of December 31, 2021. This range demonstrates the sensitivity of the ECL to key quantitative assumptions; however, it is not intended to estimate
changes in the overall ECL as it does not reflect qualitative factor adjustments which are important considerations to ensure the allowance reflects our best estimate
of current expected credit losses.

We apply certain qualitative factor adjustments to the results obtained through our quantitative ECL models to consider model imprecision, emerging risk
assessments, trends and other subjective factors that may not be adequately represented in the quantitative ECL models. These adjustments to historical loss
information are for asset-specific risk characteristics and also reflect our assessment of the extent that current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts
differ from conditions that existed during the period over which historical information was evaluated. Given the current processes and risk monitoring by the Bank,
management believes the combination of the quantitative model results and the qualitative factor adjustment represents a reasonable and appropriate estimate of
ECL.

Net Interest Income and Margin (Fully Taxable Equivalent Basis)

NII is defined as the difference between: (i) interest earned on loans, fixed income investments in our AFS and HTM securities portfolios and short-term
investment securities and (ii) interest paid on funding sources. Net interest margin is defined as NII, on a fully taxable equivalent basis, as a percentage of average
interest-earning assets. NII and net interest margin are presented on a fully taxable equivalent basis to consistently reflect income from taxable loans and securities
and tax-exempt securities based on the applicable federal statutory tax rate.

Analysis of Net Interest Income Changes Due to Volume and Rate (Fully Taxable Equivalent Basis)

NII is affected by changes in the amount and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, referred to as <volume change.= NII is also affected by
changes in yields earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, referred to as <rate change.= The following table sets forth changes in
interest income for each major category of interest-earning assets and interest expense for each major category of interest-bearing liabilities. The table also reflects
the amount of simultaneous changes attributable to both volume and rate changes for the years indicated. For this table, changes that are not solely due to either
volume or rate are allocated in proportion to the percentage changes in average volume and average rate.

Net Interest Income (Fully Taxable Equivalent Basis)

NII increased by $1.0 billion to $3.2 billion in 2021, compared to $2.2 billion in 2020. Overall, our NII increased primarily from increases in average balances of
our fixed income investment securities and loans due to increases in average balances. The increase in NII was partially offset by lower yields on fixed income
investment securities and loans. Upon completion of the Boston Private acquisition, a $104 million fair market value adjustment was made on the acquired loans that
will be amortized into loan interest income over the contractual terms of the underlying loans using the constant effective yield method. The adjustment will be
approximately 90 percent amortized by the end of fiscal year 2023. For the year ended December 31, 2021, $39 million of this premium amortization partially offset
the overall increase in NII.

The main factors affecting interest income and interest expense for 2021, compared to 2020, are discussed below:
" Interest income for 2021 increased by $1.0 billion primarily due to:
ç A $621 million increase in interest income from our fixed income investment securities due primarily to an increase of $51.3 billion in average fixed
income investment securities driven by exceptional average deposit growth. The increase in interest income from growth of our average fixed
income investment securities was partially offset by declines in yields earned on these investments reflective of the lower interest rate market
environment, and
ç A $446 million increase in interest income on loans to $2.0 billion in 2021, compared to $1.5 billion for the comparable 2020 period. The increase
was reflective of an increase in average loan balances of $17.3 billion, partially offset by a decrease in overall loan yields of 48 bps to 3.60 percent
from 4.08 percent. Gross loan yields, excluding loan interest recoveries and loan fees, decreased 36 bps to 3.21 percent from 3.57 percent, driven by
growth in our lower yielding Global Fund Banking portfolio, decreases in Federal Funds rates in the first quarter of 2020 and the addition of lower
yielding Boston Private loans.
" Interest expense for 2021 increased by $25 million primarily due to:
ç A $23 million increase in interest expense on borrowings due primarily to interest expense on our 3.125% Senior Notes issued in June 2020, our
1.800% Senior Notes issued in February 2021, our 2.100% Senior Notes issued in May 2021 and our 1.800% Senior Notes issued in October 2021.

Net Interest Margin (Fully Taxable Equivalent Basis)

Our net interest margin decreased by 65 bps to 2.02 percent in 2021, compared to 2.67 percent in 2020.
The decrease in our net interest margin in 2021 was due primarily to higher growth in our lower-yielding cash and investment securities portfolio relative to the
growth in our loan portfolio driven by significant growth in our average deposits, as well as a decrease in yields on loans, as discussed above. For the year ended
December 31, 2021, our loan portfolio comprised 34 percent of our average interest-earning assets, a decrease from 46 percent for the year ended December 31,

Average Balances, Yields and Rates Paid (Fully Taxable Equivalent Basis)

The average yield earned on interest-earning assets is the amount of fully taxable equivalent interest income expressed as a percentage of average interest-
earning assets. The average rate paid on funding sources is the amount of interest expense expressed as a percentage of average funding sources. The following tables
set forth average assets, liabilities, noncontrolling interests, preferred stock and SVBFG common stockholders9 equity, interest income, interest expense, yields and
rates and the composition of our net interest margin in 2021, 2020 and 2019:

Provision for Credit Losses

The provision for credit losses is the combination of (i) the provision for loans, (ii) the provision for unfunded credit commitments and (iii) the provision for HTM
securities. Our allowance for credit losses reflects our best estimate of probable credit losses that are inherent in the portfolios at the balance sheet date.

Unfunded Credit Commitments= of the <Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements= under Part II, Item 8 of this report for further details on our ACL.

Provision for Loans

We had a provision for loans of $66 million in 2021, compared to a provision of $190 million in 2020. The provision for loans of $66 million in 2021 was driven
primarily by a $64 million increase for organic growth in our loan portfolio, the $44 million initial provision for Boston Private non-PCD loans, and $113 million of
charge-offs not specifically reserved for at December 31, 2020, of which $80 million was related to a single instance of fraudulent activity on one loan as disclosed in
previous filings. These increases in the provision were partially offset by $24 million of recoveries, a $62 million reduction in performing reserves as a result of the
ongoing improvement of economic scenarios in our forecast models, and a $69 million reduction in provision due to model enhancements.

The enhancements to our standard reserving model consisted primarily of (i) more granular prepayment modeling, (ii) the addition of two years of incremental
data and (iii) re-selection of certain macroeconomic variables. We refined our prepayment assumptions to be more granular and product-specific, with the largest
impact being a lower weighted average life in our SVB Private Bank portfolio reflective of higher prepayment rates in that segment. The additional two years of
portfolio data reflected generally strong credit performance, despite the recently stressed economic environment. The re-selection of variables applied across the
entirety of the standard SVB CECL model, though the resulting impact was most relevant to our SVB Private Bank portfolio. Our model for estimating the probability of
default on SVB Private Bank loans previously referenced GDP as a key macroeconomic variable. The COVID-19 pandemic introduced unprecedented volatility in GDP
forecasts and modelling outcomes, some of which did not fully align with our expectation of credit losses in the Private Bank, given the majority of this portfolio
consists of mortgage loans, and credit quality indicators remained strong. Based on our additional historical experience, we now believe the Housing Price Index is a
more appropriate macroeconomic variable for this segment, particularly in terms of its performance during the COVID pandemic and our expectation for Private Bank
losses.

We had a provision for loans of $190 million in 2020, compared to a provision of $94 million in 2019. The provision for loans of $190 million in 2020 was driven
primarily by $57 million in additional reserves for our performing loans based on our forecast models of the current economic environment under the CECL
methodology adopted January 1, 2020, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as changes in loan composition within our portfolio segments, $60
million in net new nonaccrual loans, $49 million for charge-offs not specifically reserved for at December 31, 2019 and $55 million in additional reserves for period-end
loan growth, partially offset by $29 million of recoveries.

Provision for Unfunded Credit Commitments

We recorded a provision for unfunded credit commitments of $50 million in 2021, compared to a provision of $30 million in 2020. Our provision for unfunded
credit commitments in 2021 was driven primarily by growth in our outstanding commitments and changes in the unfunded portfolio composition, as well as an
increase in the expected future commitments for milestone tranches of Investor Dependent loans, which are tied to company performance or additional funding
rounds, resulting in a longer weighted average life of these higher risk segments. These increases were partially offset by improved economic scenarios in our forecast
models.

We recorded a provision for unfunded credit commitments of $30 million in 2020, compared to a provision of $13 million in 2019. Our provision for unfunded
credit commitments in 2020 was driven primarily by the forecast models of the current economic environment under the CECL methodology adopted January 1, 2020,
including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as growth in unfunded credit commitments.

Provision for HTM Securities

We recorded a provision for HTM securities of $7 million in 2021. Our provision for HTM securities was driven primarily by the creation of our corporate bond
portfolio, which had a balance of $712 million at December 31, 2021. Our HTM portfolio as of December 31, 2021 was entirely made up of A3 or better rated bonds,
all considered investment grade.

We recorded a provision for credit losses for HTM securities of less than $1 million in 2020 under the CECL methodology adopted January 1, 2020, compared to a
provision of zero under the previous incurred loss methodology. Our provision for

51
Table of Contents

HTM securities was driven primarily by the forecast models of the current economic environment, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our HTM portfolio
as of December 31, 2020 was entirely made up of Aa2 or better rated bonds, all considered high quality.

See Note 10 4 <Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses: Loans and Unfunded Credit Commitments= of the <Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements= under
Part II, Item 8 of this report for further details on our gross loan charge-offs and our ACL for loans and unfunded credit commitments.

Noninterest Income

For the year ended December 31, 2021, noninterest income was $2.7 billion, compared to $1.8 billion for comparable 2020 period. For the year ended December
31, 2021, non-GAAP core fee income was $751 million, compared to $603 million for the comparable 2020 period. For the year ended December 31, 2021, non-GAAP
SVB Securities revenue was $538 million, compared to $481 million for the comparable 2020 period. (See reconciliations of non-GAAP measures used below under
"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures".)

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement our audited consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP measures of financial performance
(including, but not limited to, non-GAAP core fee income, non-GAAP SVB Securities revenue, non-GAAP core fee income plus SVB Securities revenue, non-GAAP net
gains on investment securities and non-GAAP financial ratios). These supplemental performance measures may vary from, and may not be comparable to, similarly
titled measures by other companies in our industry. Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, GAAP. Generally, a non-GAAP
financial measure is a numerical measure of a company9s performance that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the
most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. A non-GAAP financial measure may also be a financial metric that is not
required by GAAP or other applicable requirement.

We believe these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide meaningful supplemental
information regarding our performance by (i) excluding items that represent income attributable to investors other than us and our subsidiaries and (ii) providing
additional information used by management that is not otherwise required by GAAP or other applicable requirements. Our management uses, and believes that
investors benefit from referring to, these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our operating results and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods.
However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or preferable to, financial measures prepared in
accordance with GAAP.

Included in net income is income and expense attributable to noncontrolling interests. We recognize, as part of our investment funds management business
through SVB Capital and SVB Securities, the entire income or loss from funds consolidated in accordance with ASC Topic 810 as discussed in Note 24<Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies= of the <Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements= under Part II, Item 8 of this report. We are required under GAAP to
consolidate 100% of the results of these entities, even though we may own less than 100% of such entities. The relevant amounts attributable to investors other than
us are reflected under <Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests= on our statements of income. Where applicable, the tables below for noninterest income
and net gains on investment securities exclude noncontrolling interests.

Core fee income is a non-GAAP financial measure, which represents GAAP noninterest income, but excludes (i) SVB Securities revenue, (ii) certain line items
where performance is typically subject to market or other conditions beyond our control, primarily our net gains (losses) on investment securities and equity warrant
assets, and (iii) other noninterest income. Core fee income represents client investment fees, wealth management and trust fees, foreign exchange fees, credit card
fees, deposit service charges, lending related fees and letters of credit and standby letters of credit fees.

SVB Securities revenue is a non-GAAP financial measure, which represents noninterest income but excludes (i) Core fee income, and (ii) certain line items where
performance is typically subject to market or other conditions beyond our control, primarily our net gains (losses) on investment securities and equity warrant assets,
and other noninterest income. SVB Securities revenue represents investment banking revenue and commissions.

Core fee income plus SVB Securities revenue is a non-GAAP measure, which represents GAAP noninterest income, but excludes certain line items where
performance is typically subject to market or other conditions beyond our control, primarily our net gains (losses) on investment securities and equity warrant assets,
and other noninterest income. Core fee income plus SVB Securities revenue represents core fee income plus investment banking revenue and commissions.

Gains on Investment Securities, Net

Net gains on investment securities include gains and losses from our non-marketable and other equity securities, which include public equity securities held as a
result of exercised equity warrant assets, as well as gains and losses from sales of our AFS debt securities portfolio, when applicable.

Our non-marketable and other equity securities portfolio primarily represents investments in venture capital and private equity funds, SPD-SVB, debt and credit
funds, private and public portfolio companies and qualified affordable housing projects. We experience variability in the performance of our non-marketable and
other equity securities from period to period, which results in net gains or losses on investment securities (both realized and unrealized). This variability is due to a
number of factors, including unrealized changes in the values of our investments, changes in the amount of realized gains and losses from distributions and sales of
public equity securities, changes in liquidity events and general economic and market conditions. Unrealized gains or losses from non-marketable and other equity
securities for any single period are typically driven by valuation changes, and are therefore subject to potential increases or decreases in future periods. Such
variability may lead to volatility in the gains or losses from investment securities. As such, our results for a particular period are not necessarily indicative of our
expected performance in a future period.

The extent to which any unrealized gains or losses will become realized is subject to a variety of factors, including, among other things, the expiration of certain
sales restrictions to which these equity securities may be subject to (e.g. lock-up agreements), changes in prevailing market prices, market conditions, the actual sales
or distributions of securities and the timing of such actual sales or distributions, which, to the extent such securities are managed by our managed funds, are subject to
our funds' separate discretionary sales/distributions and governance processes.

Our AFS securities portfolio is a fixed income investment portfolio that is managed with the objective of earning an appropriate portfolio yield over the long-
term while maintaining sufficient liquidity and credit diversification as well as addressing our asset/liability management objectives. Though infrequent, sales of debt
securities in our AFS securities portfolio may result in net gains or losses and are conducted pursuant to the guidelines of our investment policy related to the
management of our liquidity position and interest rate risk.

In 2021, we had net gains on investment securities of $761 million, compared to $421 million in 2020. Non-GAAP net gains on investment securities, net of
noncontrolling interests were $521 million in 2021, compared to $335 million in 2020, respectively. Net gains on investment securities, net of noncontrolling interests
of $521 million in 2021 were driven by the following:

" Gains of $195 million from our managed fund of funds portfolio driven by unrealized valuations increases of private and public positions as well as fund
distributions driven primarily by realized gains from one public company position,
" Gains of $170 million from our strategic and other investments driven primarily by net unrealized valuation increases,
" Gains of $61 million from SVB Securities driven primarily by unrealized valuation gains from the SVB Securities funds, and
" Gains of $31 million from our AFS debt securities portfolio, resulting from the sale of $1.6 billion of mortgage-backed securities.
In 2020, we had net gains on investment securities of $421 million, compared to $135 million in 2019. Non-GAAP net gains on investment securities, net of
noncontrolling interests were $334 million in 2020, compared to $87 million in 2019, respectively. Net gains on investment securities, net of noncontrolling interests
of $334 million in 2020 were driven by the following:

" Gains of $90 million from our managed funds of funds portfolio and managed direct venture funds, related primarily to net unrealized valuation increases
in investments held by the funds in the portfolio,
" Gains of $66 million from our strategic and other investments portfolio, primarily driven by net unrealized valuation increases in both private and public
company investments held in our strategic venture capital funds, and
" Gains of $95 million from our public equity securities, primarily driven by $72 million from unrealized gains for the 2.4 million common shares held as of
December 31, 2020 in BigCommerce Holdings, Inc ("BigCommerce") and $15 million realized gains for the sale of BigCommerce equity shares,
" Gains of $61 million from our AFS debt securities portfolio, resulting from the sale of $2.6 billion of U.S. Treasury securities during the quarter, and

Table of Contents

" Gains of $16 million from carried interest on our managed credit funds, acquired from WRG which closed on December 23, 2020. Performance fees earned
from the arrangement existing prior to the acquisition of the debt fund business from WRG were previously recorded in other noninterest income and
exchanged for carried interest as part of the acquisition. As a result, we recorded unrealized gains of $16 million net of noncontrolling interest related to
carried interest on the managed credit funds. These gains were primarily driven by the IPO of BigCommerce.

(1) At December 31, 2021, we held warrants in 2,831 companies, compared to 2,602 companies at December 31, 2020. The total value of our warrant portfolio was
$277 million at December 31, 2021 and $203 million at December 31, 2020. Warrants in 47 companies each had fair values greater than $1 million and
collectively represented $140.0 million, or 50.5 percent, of the fair value of the total warrant portfolio at December 31, 2021.
Gains on equity warrant assets, net, were $560 million in 2021, compared to $237 million in 2020. Net gains on equity warrant assets of $560 million in
2021 were primarily due to the following:
" Net gains on warrant exercises of $446 million reflective of $116 million in gains related to Coinbase's direct listing, with the remaining gains driven
primarily by IPO activity, and
" Net gains of $116 million from warrant valuations increases, driven by our private company portfolio reflective of pricing updates and pending exit activity.
Gains on equity warrant assets, net, of $237 million in 2020 were primarily due to the following:
" Net gains of $180 million from the exercises of equity warrant assets in 2020 driven by robust IPO, SPAC and M&A activity during 2020, including $11
million from our exercised warrant position in BigCommerce, and
" Net gains of $60 million from changes in warrant valuations in 2020 driven by valuation increases in our private company warrant portfolio.
Overall, net gains on investment securities and net gains on equity warrant assets were exceptionally strong for 2021. Combined, they totaled $1.3 billion
($1.1 billion net of noncontrolling interest) for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Gains (or losses) related to our equity securities in public companies are based on valuation changes or the sale of any securities, and are subject to such
companies' stock price, which are subject to market conditions and various other factors. Additionally, the public equity investment expected gains and losses,
and the extent to which such gains (or losses) will become realized is subject to a variety of factors, including among other factors, changes in prevailing market
prices and the timing of any sales of securities, which are subject to our securities sales and governance process as well as certain sales restrictions (e.g. lock-up
agreements).

Client Investment Fees

We offer a variety of investment products on which we earn fees. These products include money market mutual funds, overnight repurchase agreements and
sweep money market funds available through the Bank, client-directed accounts offered through our broker-dealer, SVB Wealth Advisory, and fixed income
management services offered through SVB Asset Management, our investment advisory subsidiary.

Client investment fees were $75 million in 2021, compared to $132 million in 2020. The decrease in client investment fees is reflective of a reduction in fee
margin resulting from lower short-term market rates, partially offset by large increases in average off-balance sheet client investment funds.

(1) Other employee incentives and benefits includes employer payroll taxes, group health and life insurance, share-based compensation, 401(k), ESOP, warrant and
other incentive plans, retention plans, agency fees and other employee-related expenses.

Compensation and benefits expense was $2.0 billion in 2021, compared to $1.3 billion in 2020. The key factors driving the increase in compensation and
benefits expense in 2021 were as follows:

" An increase of $205 million in salaries and wages expense, reflective primarily of an increase in the number of average FTEs by 1,426 to 5,466 in 2021,
compared to 4,040 in 2020, driven by strong hiring for in-sourcing, product development and revenue growth, the Boston Private acquisition and strategic
hires made during 2021 to support the expansion of SVB Securities' Technology, Healthcare Services and HealthTech investment banking activities,
" An increase of $320 million in incentive compensation plans expense related primarily to higher incentive compensation plan accruals as a result of
stronger than expected performance during throughout 2021 and an increase in the number of average FTEs, and
" An increase of $172 million in other employee incentives and benefits expense attributable primarily to increases in share-based compensation expense
due to the increased restricted stock awards granted during 2021, the warrant incentive plan driven by a significant increase in gains on equity warrant
assets, payroll taxes due to an increase in incentive compensation and group insurance expenses reflective of the increase in FTEs from 2020.
Our variable compensation plans include our Incentive Compensation Plan, Direct Drive Incentive Compensation Plan, Retention Program, Warrant Incentive
Plan, Deferred Compensation Plan, 401(k) and ESOP Plan, SVB Securities Incentive Compensation Plan, SVB Securities Retention Award, EHOP, 2006 Incentive Plan and
ESPP. Total costs incurred under these plans were $917 million in 2021, compared to $547 million in 2020. These amounts are included in total compensation and
benefits expense discussed above.

Professional Services

Professional services expense was $392 million in 2021, compared to $247 million in 2020. The increase in December 31, 2021 was driven primarily by higher
consulting fees associated with our initiatives related to our regulatory programs as well as continued investments in our infrastructure and operating projects to
support our presence both domestically and internationally.

Premises and Equipment

Premises and equipment expense was $178 million in 2021, compared to $127 million in 2020. The increase was driven primarily by an increase in computer
maintenance expenses related to new vendor and project depreciation that began in 2021 and increased software support and maintenance service fees.

Net Occupancy

Net occupancy expense was $83 million in 2021, compared to $101 million in 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by $29 million of impairment and
accelerated depreciation of right to use assets and other fixed assets recorded in 2020 related to vacating leased office space in several locations.

Table of Contents

Business Development and Travel

Business development and travel expense was $24 million in 2021, compared to $24 million in 2020. Business development and travel expense was flat
compared to 2020 due primarily to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on domestic and international travel restrictions during 2020 and early 2021 which started
to ease during the latter half of 2021 resulting in continued business development and travel.

FDIC and State Assessments

FDIC and state assessments expense was $48 million in 2021, compared to $28 million in 2020. The increase was due primarily to the increase in our organic
average deposits as well as the acquisition of Boston Private deposits.

Merger-related Charges

Merger-related charges was a new noninterest expense line item for 2021 as a result of the Boston Private acquisition. A summary of merger-related charges,
which includes direct acquisition costs for the year ended 2021 is as follows:

Year ended December 31,

(Dollars in millions) 2021

Personnel-related $ 17
Occupancy and facilities 39
Professional services 56
Systems integration and related charges 17

Total merger-related charges $^129

Operating Efficiency Ratio

Our operating efficiency ratio increased to 51.88 percent for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 50.92 percent for the year ended December 31,
This increase was due to growth in noninterest expense slightly outpacing revenue growth. The increase in noninterest expense was driven by increased
compensation and benefits expense, professional services expense, merger-related charges and premises and equipment expense. These increases were partially
offset by higher revenue driven by interest income on our loan and investment security portfolios and net gains on investment securities and equity warrant assets.
Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests

Included in net income is income and expense attributable to noncontrolling interests. The relevant amounts allocated to investors in our consolidated
subsidiaries, other than us, are reflected under <net income attributable to noncontrolling interests= on our consolidated statements of income.

In the table below, noninterest income consists primarily of net investment gains and losses from our consolidated funds. Noninterest expense is primarily
related to management fees paid by our managed funds to SVB Financial's subsidiaries as the managed funds9 general partners. A summary of net income attributable
to noncontrolling interests for 2021, 2020 and 2019 is as follows:

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $240 million in 2021, compared to $86 million in 2020. Net income attributable to noncontrolling
interests of $240 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 was driven primarily by net gains on investment securities (including carried interest allocation) from
unrealized valuation of our managed funds of funds and our SVB Securities funds.

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $86 million in 2020. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of $86 million for 2020 was
primarily a result of the following:

" Net gains on investment securities (including carried interest allocation) attributable to noncontrolling interests of $86 million ($29 million excluding
carried interest allocation) primarily from our managed funds of funds and our managed direct venture funds portfolios, related primarily to net unrealized
valuation increases in both private and public company investments held by the funds in the portfolios, and
" Noninterest expense was less than $1 million, primarily related to management fees paid by the noncontrolling interests to our subsidiaries that serve as
the general partner.
Income Taxes

Our effective income tax expense rate was 26.2 percent in 2021, compared to 27.0 percent in 2020. Our effective tax rate is calculated by dividing income tax
expense by the sum of income before income tax expense and the net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. The components of our effective tax rates for
2021 and 2020 are discussed in Note 184<Income Taxes= of the <Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements= under Part II, Item 8 of this report.

The decrease in our effective tax rate for 2021 was driven primarily by an increase in the recognition of excess tax benefits from share-based compensation,
which is reflective of an increase in our stock price.

Operating Segment Results

We have four segments for which we report our financial information: GCB, SVB Private Bank, SVB Capital and SVB Securities.
We report segment information based on the <management= approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for
making decisions and assessing performance as the source of our reporting segments. Refer to Note 244<Segment Reporting= of the <Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements= under Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional details.

Income before income tax expense from our GCB increased to $2.3 billion in 2021, compared to $1.4 billion in 2020. The key components of GCB's performance
are discussed below.

NII from GCB increased by $921 million in 2021, due primarily to an increase in loan interest income resulting from higher average loan balances, partially offset
by lower loan yields on loans as a result of growth in our higher credit quality Global Fund Banking portfolio as well as interest rate decreases. In addition, strong
deposit growth provided a higher earnings credit and a low-rate environment produced a lower earnings charge for funded loans, creating a benefit of a higher net
FTP earnings credit.

GCB had a provision for credit losses of $55 million for 2021, compared to a provision of $166 million for 2020. The provision of $55 million for 2021 was driven
primarily by an increase of organic growth in our loan portfolio and charge-offs not specifically reserved for at December 31, 2020, of which $80 million was related to
the single instance of fraudulent

62
Table of Contents

activity on one loan discussed in prior filings, partially offset by a reduction in provision due to model enhancements and a decrease in net new nonaccrual loans and
recoveries.

The provision for credit losses of $166 million for 2020, compared to a provision of $92 million for the comparable 2019 period. The $74 million increase is
primarily due to the $59 million in additional reserves for our performing loans based on our forecast models of the current economic environment under the CECL
methodology adopted January 1, 2020, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as changes in loan composition within our portfolio segments. The
provision of $166 million also consisted of $30 million in additional reserves for period-end loan growth, $49 million for charge-offs not specifically reserved for at
December 31, 2019 and $60 million in net new nonaccrual loans, partially offset by $29 million of recoveries.

Noninterest income increased by $102 million in 2021, related primarily to an overall increase in our non-GAAP core fee income, due primarily to higher foreign
exchange fees, credit card fees, lending related fees and deposit service charges, partially offset by lower client investment fees. The overall increase was due
primarily to higher foreign exchange fees driven by increases in spot contract commissions, credit card fees reflective of increased spending as we attracted new
customers and expanded on current relationships and deposit service charges due to increased product revenues from strong deposit growth and higher transaction
volumes, partially offset by the impact of the federal funds rate decreases on client investment fee yields.

Noninterest expense increased by $257 million in 2021, due primarily to compensation and benefits expense as a result of higher incentive compensation
expense and higher salaries and wages expenses. Incentive compensation expense increased due primarily as a result of a strong performance during 2021. The
increase in GCB salaries and wages was due primarily to an increase in the average number of FTEs at GCB, which increased to 3,489 FTEs in 2021, from 2,874 FTEs for
the 2020 period.

Income before income tax expense from SVB Private Bank increased to $24 million in 2021, compared to $13 million in 2020. The key drivers of SVB Private
Bank's performance are discussed below:

NII increased by $117 million in 2021, due primarily to an increase in average loans primarily due to the acquisition of Boston Private and strong organic loan
growth for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was partially offset by decreases in loan yields as a
result of overall market rate decreases and purchase accounting amortizations of fair value mark ups on the acquired Boston Private loans.

The provision for credit losses decreased by $7 million primarily due to a reduction in provision due to previously discussed model enhancements, partially
offset by a day one provision for loans on non-PCD loans and unfunded commitments of $46 million as a result of the Boston Private acquisition.

Noninterest expense increased $166 million to $212 million in 2021 related primarily to compensation and benefits expense. Compensation and benefits
expense increased as a result of an increase in average number of FTEs due primarily to the acquisition of Boston Private and higher incentive compensation and
salaries and wages expenses primarily as a result of strong performance during 2021.

SVB Capital9s components of noninterest income primarily include net gains and losses on non-marketable and other equity securities, carried interest and fund
management fees. All components of income before income tax expense discussed below are net of noncontrolling interests.

We experience variability in the performance of SVB Capital from period to period due to a number of factors, including changes in the values of our funds9
underlying investments, changes in the amount of distributions and general economic and market conditions. Such variability may lead to volatility in the gains and
losses from investment securities and cause our results to differ from period to period. The performance of these securities may be impacted by the effects of the
COVID-19 pandemic.

Income before income tax expense from SVB Capital was $416 million in 2021, compared to $175 million in 2020. The key drivers of SVB Capital's performance
are discussed below.

Noninterest income was $487 million in 2021, compared to $226 million in 2020. SVB Capital9s components of noninterest income primarily included the
following:

" Net gains on investment securities of $398 million, were driven primarily by unrealized net valuation increases of private and public positions as well as
fund distributions driven primarily by realized gains from one public company position.
" Fund management fees of $77 million, included in other noninterest income, and
" Gains on equity warrant assets of $6 million reflective of net valuation increases in equity warrant assets associated with our joint venture bank in China,
included in other noninterest income.
Noninterest expense increased to $71 million in 2021 from 2020 due to a $20 million increase in compensation and benefits as a result of higher incentive
compensation expense and higher salaries and wages expenses. Incentive compensation expense increased as a result of a strong performance during 2021. The
increase in salaries and wages was due to an increase in the average number of FTEs at SVB Capital, which increased to 77 FTEs at year end December 31, 2021, from
47 for 2020.

On December 10, 2021 we completed the acquisition of MoffettNathanson LLC. Upon the closing of the acquisition, MoffettNathanson LLC's operations and
results were included within the SVB Securities reportable segment. The acquisition enables SVB Securities to expand its equity research coverage to include
companies in both the healthcare and technology industries.

SVB Securities' components of noninterest income primarily include investment banking revenue, commissions and net gains and losses on non-marketable and
other equity securities, carried interest and fund management fees. All components of income before income tax expense discussed below are net of noncontrolling
interests.

64
Table of Contents

Noninterest income increased $111 million to $608 million in 2021, due primarily to an increase in investment banking revenue attributable to a higher number
of total closed deals during 2021 and an increase in investment gains driven by a net valuation increase on equity fund investments.

Noninterest expense increased $182 million to $561 million in 2021. The $182 million increase was primarily driven by an increase in compensation and benefit
expense driven primarily by an increase in incentive compensation expense as a result of a strong performance during 2021, as compared to 2020 and an increase in
salaries and wages expense due to strategic hires made during 2021 to support the expansion of SVB Securities' Technology, Healthcare Services and HealthTech
investment banking activities.

Consolidated Financial Condition

Our total assets, and total liabilities and stockholders' equity were $211.5 billion at December 31, 2021 and $115.5 billion at December 31, 2020. Refer below to
a summary of the individual components driving the changes in total assets, total liabilities and stockholders' equity.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents totaled $14.6 billion at December 31, 2021, a decrease of $3.1 billion, or 17.3 percent, compared to $17.7 billion at December 31,
The decrease was driven primarily by investing activities of $90.3 billion consisting primarily of purchases of investment securities, net of maturities and
paydowns, and funding of loans, partially offset by financing activities of $85.5 billion consisting primarily of a net increase in deposits. As of December 31, 2021, $5.7
billion of our cash and due from banks was deposited at the FRB and was earning interest at the Federal Funds target rate, and interest-earning deposits in other
financial institutions were $5.8 billion. As of December 31, 2020, $13.7 billion, of our cash and due from banks was deposited at the FRB and was earning interest at
the Federal Funds target rate and interest-earning deposits in other financial institutions were $3.0 billion.
Investment Securities

Investment securities totaled $128.0 billion at December 31, 2021, an increase of $78.7 billion, or 159.5 percent, compared to $49.3 billion at December 31,
Our investment securities portfolio is comprised of: (i) an AFS securities portfolio and a HTM securities portfolio, both of which represents interest-earning fixed
income investment securities; and (ii) a non-marketable and other equity securities portfolio, which represents primarily investments managed as part of our funds
management business, investments in qualified affordable housing projects, as well as public equity securities held as a result of equity warrant assets exercised. The
major components of the change in investment securities are explained below.

Available-for-Sale Securities

Period-end AFS securities were $27.2 billion at December 31, 2021, a decrease of $3.7 billion, or 11.9 percent, compared to $30.9 billion at December 31, 2020.
The $3.7 billion decrease in period-end AFS securities balances from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021 was driven primarily by a $8.8 billion re-designation of
AFS securities to HTM securities, paydowns and maturities of $4.8 billion, sale of investments of $1.6 billion and a decrease in fair value of $818 million due to the
increase in interest rates, partially offset by purchases of $12.1 billion. Securities classified as AFS are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded as
unrealized gains or losses in a separate component of stockholders' equity.

The following table summarizes the remaining contractual principal maturities and fully taxable equivalent yields on fixed income securities, carried at fair value,
classified as AFS as of December 31, 2021. The weighted average yield is computed using the amortized cost of fixed income investment securities, which are reported
at fair value. For U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. agency debentures and foreign government debt securities, the expected maturity is the actual contractual maturity of
the notes. Expected remaining maturities for certain U.S. agency debentures may occur earlier than their contractual maturities because the note issuers have the
right to call outstanding amounts ahead of their contractual

Table of Contents

maturity. Expected maturities for MBS may differ significantly from their contractual maturities because mortgage borrowers have the right to prepay outstanding
loan obligations with or without penalties. MBS classified as AFS typically have original contractual maturities from 10 to 30 years whereas expected average lives of
these securities tend to be significantly shorter and vary based upon structure and prepayments in lower interest rate environments. The expected yield on MBS is
based on prepayment assumptions at the purchase date. Actual yields earned may differ significantly based upon actual prepayments.

Held-to-Maturity Securities

Period-end HTM securities were $98.2 billion at December 31, 2021, an increase of $81.6 billion, or 491.8 percent, compared to $16.6 billion at December 31,
The $81.6 billion increase in period-end HTM security balances from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021 was driven by purchases of $85.6 billion, with an
additional $982 million of securities assumed with the Boston Private acquisition, and the re-designation of $8.8 billion of AFS securities to HTM securities, partially
offset by $13.8 billion in paydowns and maturities. The securities were re-designated for capital management purposes and consisted primarily of agency-issued CMO,
CMBS, MBS and US agency debentures with unrealized losses totaling $132 million, which are recorded in AOCI
Securities classified as HTM are accounted for at cost with no adjustments for changes in fair value. For securities re-designated as HTM from AFS, the net
unrealized gains or losses at the date of transfer will continue to be reported as a separate component of shareholders' equity and amortized over the life of the
securities in a manner consistent with the amortization of a premium or discount.

The following table summarizes the remaining contractual principal maturities net of ACL and fully taxable equivalent yields on fixed income investment
securities classified as HTM as of December 31, 2021. Interest income on certain municipal bonds and notes (non-taxable investments) are presented on a fully taxable
equivalent basis using the federal statutory tax rate of 21.0 percent. The weighted average yield is computed using the amortized cost of fixed income investment
securities. For U.S. agency debentures, the expected maturity is the actual contractual maturity of the notes. Expected maturities for MBS may differ significantly from
their contractual maturities because mortgage borrowers have the right to prepay outstanding loan obligations with or without penalties. MBS classified as HTM
typically have original contractual maturities from 10 to 30 years whereas expected average lives of these securities tend to be significantly shorter and vary based
upon structure and prepayments in lower interest rate environments. The expected yield on MBS is based on prepayment assumptions at the purchase date. Actual
yields earned may differ significantly based upon actual prepayments.

Portfolio duration is a standard measure used to approximate changes in the market value of fixed income instruments due to a change in market interest rates.
The measure is an estimate based on the level of current market interest rates, expectations for changes in the path of forward rates and the effect of forward rates
on mortgage prepayment speed assumptions. As such, portfolio duration will fluctuate with changes in market interest rates. Changes in portfolio duration are also
impacted by changes in the mix of longer versus shorter term-to-maturity securities. The estimated weighted-average duration of our fixed income investment
securities portfolio was 4.0 and 3.7 years at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The weighted-average duration of our total fixed income
securities portfolio including the impact of our fair value swaps was 3.7 years at December 31, 2021. We are focused on maintaining AFS portfolio duration to
approximately two years to mitigate OCI risk while buying three- to five-year duration HTM securities to support portfolio yields. The weighted-average duration of our
AFS securities portfolio was 3.5 years at December 31, 2021 and 3.7 years at December 31, 2020. The weighted-average duration of our AFS securities portfolio
including the impact of our fair value swaps was 2.4 years at December 31, 2021. The weighted-average duration of our HTM securities portfolio was 4.1 years at
December 31, 2021 and 3.7 years at December 31, 2020. We continue to invest excess on-balance sheet liquidity in high-quality securities (agency MBS/CMOs/CMBS,
municipal and corporate securities), primarily classified as HTM.

Non-Marketable and Other Equity Securities

Our non-marketable and other equity securities portfolio primarily represents investments in venture capital and private equity funds, SPD-SVB, debt funds,
private and public portfolio companies, including public equity securities held as a result of equity warrant assets exercised, and qualified affordable housing projects.
Included in our non-marketable and other equity securities carried under fair value accounting are amounts that are attributable to noncontrolling interests. We are
required under GAAP to consolidate 100% of these investments that we are deemed to control, even though we may own less than 100% of such entities. See below
for a summary of the carrying value (as reported) of non-marketable and other equity securities compared to the amounts attributable to SVBFG.

Non-marketable and other equity securities were $2.5 billion ($2.2 billion net of noncontrolling interest) at December 31, 2021, an increase of $741 million, or
41.1 percent, compared to $1.8 billion ($1.6 billion net of noncontrolling interest) at December 31, 2020. We are required under GAAP to consolidate certain SVB

(2) The carrying value represents investments in 150 and 162 funds (primarily venture capital funds) at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively,
where our ownership interest is typically less than 5% of the voting interests of each such fund and in which we do not have the ability to exercise significant
influence over the partnerships' operating activities and financial policies. Our unconsolidated venture capital and private equity fund investments are carried at
fair value based on the fund investments' net asset values per share as obtained from the general partners of the funds. For each fund investment, we adjust the
net asset value per share for differences between our measurement date and the date of the fund investment9s net asset value by using the most recently
available financial information from the investee general partner, for example September 30 , for our December 31 consolidated financial statements, adjusted
for any contributions paid, distributions received from the investment and significant fund transactions or market events during the reporting period.

(3) Investments classified as "Other investments without a readily determinable fair value" include direct equity investments in private companies. The carrying
value is based on the price at which the investment was acquired plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for
identical or similar investments. We consider a range of factors when adjusting the fair value of these investments, including, but not limited to, the term and
nature of the investment, local market conditions, values for comparable securities, current and projected operating performance, exit strategies, financing
transactions subsequent to the acquisition of the investment and a discount for certain investments that have lock-up restrictions or other features that indicate
a discount to fair value is warranted. For further details on the carrying value of these investments refer to Note 94<Investment Securities" of the <Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements= under Part II, Item 8 of this report.

(4) Investments classified as other equity securities (fair value accounting) represent shares held in public companies as a result of exercising public equity warrant
assets and direct equity investments in public companies held by our consolidated funds. Changes in the fair value recognized through net income.

Volcker Rule

The Volcker Rule prohibits, subject to certain exceptions, a banking entity, such as the Company, from sponsoring, investing in, or having certain relationships
with covered funds. Under the currently effective regulations implementing the Volcker Rule, covered funds are defined to include many venture capital and private
equity funds.

In June 2017, we received notice that the Federal Reserve approved the Company9s application for an extension of the permitted conformance period for the
Company9s investments in <illiquid= covered funds (<Restricted Volcker Investments=). The approval extends the deadline by which the Company must sell, divest,
restructure or otherwise conform such investments to the provisions of the Volcker Rule by the earlier of (i) July 21, 2022, or (ii) the date by which each fund matures
by its terms or is otherwise conformed to the Volcker Rule.

There have been various amendments to the Volcker Rule in recent years. In particular, certain amendments that became effective October 1, 2020, provide for,
among other things, the adoption of new exclusions from the definition of <covered fund= for venture capital funds and credit funds that meet certain criteria. As a
result of these amendments, we believe that none of the Restricted Volcker Investments will be required to be disposed of or will otherwise conform to the Volcker
Rule requirements. We expect that all of our Restricted Volcker Investments will (i) qualify for these new exclusions; (ii) otherwise be excluded from the definition of
"covered fund"; or (iii) be subject to a liquidation or dissolution process (For more information about the Volcker Rule, see <Business4Supervision and Regulation=
under Part 1, Item 1 of this report).

Loans

Upon the completion of the acquisition of Boston Private on July 1, 2021, we have modified our portfolio segments and classes of financing receivables to
accommodate Boston Private loans. Refer to Note 24<Summary of Significant Accounting Policies= of the <Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements= under Part
II, Item 8 of this report for additional information on our current portfolio segments and classes of financing receivables.

Loans at amortized cost basis increased by $21.1 billion to $66.3 billion at December 31, 2021, compared to $45.2 billion at December 31, 2020. Unearned
income was $250 million at December 31, 2021 and $226 million at December 31, 2020. The increase in period-end loans was driven primarily by the continued
growth in our Global Fund Banking segment as well as the addition of Boston Private's loan portfolio. This growth was partially offset by a decrease in our PPP loans
driven by forgiveness of these loans during 2021.

Loan Concentration

Loan concentrations may exist when there are borrowers engaged in similar activities or types of loans extended to a diverse group of borrowers that could
cause those borrowers or portfolios to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions. A substantial percentage of our loans are commercial in nature. The
breakdown of total loans and loans as a percentage of total loans by class of financing receivables is as follows:

December 31,
2021 2020
(Dollars in millions) Amount Percentage Amount Percentage
Global fund banking $ 37,958 57.3 % $ 25,543 56.5 %

Total loans $ 66,276 100.0 $ 45,181 100.0

Our four main market segments include (i) Global Fund Banking, (ii) technology and life science/healthcare, (iii) SVB Private Bank and, with the acquisition of
Boston Private, we now have (iv) new loans in the commercial real estate sector.

(i) Global Fund Banking
Our Global Fund Banking loan portfolio includes loans to clients in the private equity/venture capital community. Our lending to private equity/venture
capital firms and funds represented 57 percent of total loans at both December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The vast majority of this portfolio consists of
capital call lines of credit, the repayment of which is dependent on the payment of capital calls by the underlying limited partner investors in the funds managed
by these firms. These facilities are generally governed by meaningful financial covenants oriented towards ensuring that the funds' remaining callable capital is
sufficient to repay the loan, and larger commitments (typically provided to larger private equity funds) are typically secured by an assignment of the general
partner's right to call capital from the fund's limited partner investors.
(ii) Technology and Life Science/Healthcare
Our technology and life science/healthcare loan portfolios include loans to clients at the various stages of their life cycles. The classes of financing
receivables for our technology and life science/healthcare market segments are classified as Investor Dependent, Cash Flow Dependent - SLBO or Innovation C&I
for reporting purposes.
71
Table of Contents

Investor dependent loans represented 8 percent of total loans at December 31, 2021 and 11 percent at December 31, 2020. These loans are made to
companies in both our Early Stage and Growth Stage practices.
Cash flow dependent loans for SLBO lending represented 3 percent of total loans at December 31, 2021, compared to 4 percent at December 31, 2020.
Innovation C&I loans, which include asset-based loans, represented 10 percent of total loans at December 31, 2021 and 11 percent at December 31, 2020.
Working capital lines and accounts receivable financing, both part of our asset-based lending, each represented approximately one percent and less than one
percent of total loans, respectively, at both December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.
(iii) SVB Private Bank
Our SVB Private Bank clients are primarily executive leaders and senior investment professionals in the innovation economy, as well as high net worth clients
acquired from Boston Private. Our lending to Private Bank clients represented 13 percent of total loans at December 31, 2021 and 11 percent at December 31,
Many of our Private Bank products are secured by real estate, which represented 88 percent of this portfolio at December 31, 2021; these products include
mortgage loans, owner-occupied commercial mortgage loans, home equity lines of credit and other secured lending products such as real estate secured loans to
eligible employees through our EHOP. The remaining balance of our Private Bank portfolio consists of restricted and private stock loans, personal capital call lines
of credit, lines of credit against liquid assets and other secured and unsecured lending products.
(iv) Commercial Real Estate
The CRE loan portfolio acquired from Boston Private is made up of acquisition financing for commercial properties, such as office buildings, retail properties,
apartment buildings and industrial/warehouse space. As such, all of these products are secured by real estate. Our lending to commercial real estate clients
represented 4 percent of total loans at December 31, 2021.

Upon maturity, loans satisfying our credit quality standards may be eligible for renewal. Such renewals are subject to the normal underwriting and credit
administration practices associated with new loans. We do not grant loans with unconditional extension terms.

Paycheck Protection Program

We accepted applications under the PPP administered by the SBA under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the "CARES Act"), as amended
by the Economic Aid to Hard-Hit Small Businesses, Nonprofits, and Venues Act (the "Economic Aid Act"), and originated loans to qualified small businesses until the
loan origination phase of the PPP ended on June 30, 2021. Under the terms of the program, loans funded through the PPP are eligible to be forgiven if certain
requirements are met, including using the funds for certain costs relating to payroll, healthcare and qualifying mortgage

74
Table of Contents

interest, rent and utility payments. Eligible expenses also include covered operations expenditures, covered property damage costs, covered supplier costs and
covered worker protection expenditures. To the extent not forgiven, loans are subject to certain terms including, among others, the following: maximum two-year
term for loans issued before June 5, 2020 (unless borrower and lender agree otherwise); a maximum five-year term for loans issued on or after June 5, 2020; an
interest rate of 1.0%; deferral of loan payments until a loan forgiveness decision is rendered or until 10 months after the end of a borrower9s forgiveness covered
period; and no requirement for any collateral or personal guarantees. PPP borrowers are not required to pay any fees to the government or the lender, and the loans
may be repaid by the borrower at any time. The SBA, however, will pay lenders a processing fee based on the size of the PPP loan, ranging from 1% to 5% of the loan
for loans made before the enactment of the Economic Aid Act, and thereafter, a processing fee of (1) the lesser of 50% of the loan or $2,500 for loans of not more
than $50,000, (2) 5% of the loan for loans above $50,000 but not more than $350,000, and (3) 3% of the loan for loans above $350,000 (and, in case of the first draw
PPP loans only, a fee of 1% for the loans at or above $2,000,000). Additional loans were issuable up until June 30, 2021, pursuant to the PPP Extension Act of 2021, and
qualifying PPP borrowers were able to apply for second draw loans in an amount of up to $2 million. We continued to participate in the forgiveness stage of the PPP
through the fourth quarter of 2021.

As of December 31, 2021, we have outstanding PPP loans in the amount of $331 million, as approved by the SBA, compared to $1.6 billion at December 31,
This funded amount reflects repayments received as of such date.
Loan Deferral Programs

In April 2020, we implemented three loan payment deferral programs targeted to assist borrowers who were the most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
These programs included relief for venture-backed, private bank and wine borrowers who met certain criteria. The three-month private bank and wine deferral
programs ended, and payments resumed, in the third quarter of 2020. The six-month venture debt and private bank deferral programs ended, and payments
resumed, in the fourth quarter of 2020 for a majority of participants. As of December 31, 2021, a single loan remained modified under these programs, with an
outstanding balance of $10 million. The borrower lengthened their existing interest-only payment period under the deferral program and is currently making interest-
only payments. As of December 31, 2020, loans modified under these programs had outstanding balances of $769 million, $13 million and $2 million for venture-
backed, private bank and wine borrowers, respectively. These amounts reflect repayments received as of December 31, 2020.

For loans modified under these programs, in accordance with the provisions of Section 4013 of the CARES Act, we elected to not apply TDR classification to
borrowers who were current as of December 31, 2019. In addition, for loans modified under these programs that did not meet the CARES Act criteria, we applied the
guidance in an interagency statement issued by bank regulatory agencies. Using this guidance, we may find that borrowers are not experiencing financial difficulty that
may otherwise result in a TDR classification, in accordance with ASC Subtopic 310-40, if loan modifications are performed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic,
provide short-term loan payment deferrals (e.g. six months in duration) and are granted to borrowers who were current as of the implementation date of the loan
modification program. We evaluated all loans modified under these programs against the CARES Act and interagency guidance, as applicable, and determined the loan
modifications would not be considered TDRs. We did not defer interest income recognition during periods of payment deferral, nor did any qualifying modification
trigger nonaccrual status.

Loan Administration

The Credit Committee of our Board of Directors oversees our credit risks and strategies, as well as our key credit policies and lending practices.
Subject to the oversight of the Credit Committee, lending authority is delegated to our Chief Credit Officer and other senior members of our lending
management based on certain size and underwriting criteria.

Credit Quality Indicators

As of both December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, our total criticized loans and nonaccrual loans collectively represented three percent of our total loans.
Criticized loans and nonaccrual loans to early-stage clients represented 13 percent and 15 percent of our total criticized loans and nonaccrual loan balances at
December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Loans to early-stage clients represent a relatively small percentage of our overall portfolio at 2 percent and 3
percent of total loans at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. It is common for an early-stage client9s remaining liquidity to fall temporarily below
the threshold for a pass-rated credit during its capital-raising period for a new round of funding. Based on our experience, for most early-stage clients, this situation
typically lasts one to two quarters and generally resolves itself with a subsequent round of venture funding, though there are exceptions, from time to time. As a
result, we expect that each of our early-stage clients will reside in our criticized portfolio during a portion of their life cycle.

As of December 31, 2021 we have identified the following risks to credit quality: (i) increased COVID-19 exposure from acquired Boston Private loans, (ii) larger
Growth Stage and Innovation C&I loan sizes, (iii) company valuation volatility and (iv) macroeconomic risks, particularly supply chain constraints and inflation.

75
Table of Contents

(i) Increased COVID-19 exposure from acquired Boston Private loans - We acquired CRE loans from Boston Private that have a balance of $2.7 billion at December
31, 2021. CRE is generally more impacted by restrictions to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and transitions to hybrid work environments. This risk is mitigated by
the reserves held for this loan class and our limited overall exposure, with CRE representing only 4 percent of total loans at December 31, 2021.
(ii) Larger Growth Stage and Innovation C&I loan sizes - The size of individual loans to our Investor Dependent - Growth Stage and Innovation C&I clients has
increased, which may introduce greater volatility to those portfolios' credit quality.
(iii) Company valuation volatility - Given the very choppy markets which are generally a precursor to private company valuations, we could see a pullback from
the very high valuations that exist today.
(iv) Macroeconomic risks, particularly supply chain constraints and inflation - We see limited impact to each of these across the portfolio though the risk exists
that one, or the combination of these, could post an issue for different segments.
Additionally, we have identified the following factors that could have a positive impact on credit quality: (i) recovering business activity, (ii) continued investor
support and (iii) improved risk profile of loan portfolio_._

(i) Recovering business activity - We continue to monitor our loan portfolio for the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, especially the emergence of COVID-19
variants and continued spread. Our portfolio has limited direct exposure to the industries most severely impacted by the pandemic.
(ii) Continued investor support - We continue to see robust venture capital investment activity and dry powder available in the market.
(iii) Improved risk profile of loan portfolio - As described above, our Investor Dependent - Early Stage class, which historically has been the most vulnerable loan
class with the most losses, is now only 2 percent of total loans. Furthermore, over 70 percent of total loans are now in our Global Fund Banking and Private Bank
classes, which have low credit loss experience.
We continue to monitor the current environment to evaluate the impact of the above on our portfolio's credit quality and to identify the emergence of
additional factors.

To determine the ACL for performing loans as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we utilized three scenarios, on a weighted basis, from Moody's Analytics
December 2021 and 2020 forecasts, respectively, in our expected lifetime loss estimate. The baseline scenario, which carries the highest weighting of 40 percent in
both periods, reflected an unemployment rate of 4.3 percent as of December 31, 2021, as a result of the ongoing economic stabilization seen in 2021, compared to 6.7
percent as of December 31, 2020. The baseline scenario also included a GDP growth rate of 6.8 percent and 4.0 percent as of December 31, 2021 and 2020,
respectively, reflecting ongoing expected economic recovery as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to subside. As part of the 2021 model enhancement
we added the housing price index as an input, which the baseline scenario reflected as 5.9 percent as of December 31, 2021, consistent with the imbalance between
supply and demand in the housing market. In addition to the baseline, we also utilized a more favorable (Moody's

S1, Upside) and less favorable (Moody's S3, Downside) economic forecast scenario, each weighted at 30 percent at both December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.
To the extent we identified credit risk considerations that were not captured by the Moody's Analytics scenarios, we addressed the risk through management's
qualitative adjustments to our ACL for performing loans.

Gross Loan Charge-Offs

Gross loan charge-offs were $138 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, of which $113 million was not specifically reserved for in prior quarters. Gross
loan charge-offs not previously reserved for were primarily driven by $80 million related to a single instance of fraudulent activity on one loan disclosed in previous
filings. The remaining $33 million of gross loan charge-offs not previously reserved for came primarily from our Investor Dependent and Innovation C&I loan portfolios.

Gross loan charge-offs were $103 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven by $89 million charge-offs for our Investor Dependent clients
and $11 million charge-offs from our Cash Flow Dependent - SLBO portfolio. The remaining charge-offs came primarily from our Private bank and Premium Wine and
Other portfolios.

Nonperforming Assets

Nonperforming assets consist of loans on nonaccrual status, loans past due 90 days or more still accruing interest, and OREO and other foreclosed assets. We
measure all loans placed on nonaccrual status for impairment based on the fair value of the underlying collateral or the net present value of the expected cash flows.
The table below sets forth certain data and ratios between nonperforming loans, nonperforming assets and the ACL for loans and unfunded credit commitments:

(1) The "ACL for loans" at December 31, 2021 includes an initial allowance of $66 million related to Boston Private loans, of which $2 million is related to nonaccrual
loans. See <Provision for Credit Losses= for a detailed discussion of the changes to the allowance.
(2) The <ACL for unfunded credit commitments= is included as a component of other liabilities and any provision is included in the <provision for credit losses= in the
statement of income. At December 31, 2021, this includes an initial allowance of $2 million related to Boston Private commitments. See <Provision for Credit
Losses= for a detailed discussion of the changes to the allowance.
(3) Includes unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit.

Our ACL for loans as a percentage of total loans decreased 35 bps to 0.64 percent at December 31, 2021, compared to 0.99 percent at December 31, 2020. The
35 bps decrease consists primarily of a 29 bps decrease for our performing loans reserve as a percentage of total loans and a 7 bps decrease for our nonaccrual
individually assessed loans. The decreases were primarily driven by improved economic conditions and enhancements in our reserving model, which were partially
offset by increases from organic loan growth and the acquisition of Boston Private. Much of our organic loan growth is driven by our Global Fund Banking portfolio,
which historically has had very low loss rates. Should the growth in this lower risk portfolio persist, it will continue to reduce the ratio of ACL to total loans.

Our performing loans reserve as a percentage of total loans includes 9 bps from the inclusion of Boston Private; nonaccrual reserves as a percentage of total
loans includes less than one basis point from Boston Private. For a detailed discussion of changes in the current period's provision, including the impacts of the model
enhancements and the Boston Private acquisition, see "Provision for Credit Losses."

Table of Contents

Our ACL for performing loans was $387 million at December 31, 2021, compared to $394 million at December 31, 2020. The $7 million decrease was driven
primarily by the improved economic scenarios in our forecast models, reflective of the ongoing improvement of the economic outlooks as the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic begins to subside and enhancements to our reserving model, which was partially offset by growth in our loan portfolio. For a detailed discussion of changes
in the current period's provision, including the impacts of the model enhancements and the Boston Private acquisition see "Provision for Credit Losses."

Nonaccrual Loans

The following table presents a summary of changes in nonaccrual loans for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:
Year ended December 31,

(1) As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, loan amounts are disclosed using the amortized cost basis as a result of the adoption of CECL. Prior period loan amounts are
disclosed using the gross basis.

Our nonaccrual loan balance decreased $20 million to $84 million at December 31, 2021, compared to $104 million at December 31, 2020. The decrease was
driven by $27 million in charge-offs and $91 million in paydowns and other reductions, partially offset by $98 million in new nonaccrual loans. Charge-offs of
nonaccrual loans were primarily driven by clients in our Investor Dependent - Early Stage loan class. Paydowns and other reductions were primarily driven by $22
million from one Investor Dependent - Growth Stage client, $17 million from one Premium Wine client, and $14 million from one CRE client. New nonaccrual loans
were driven primarily by the acquisition of $31 million nonaccrual loans from Boston Private, $17 million from one Premium Wine client, and $12 million from two
Private Bank clients. The remaining new nonaccrual loans were primarily driven by our Investor Dependent portfolio. As of December 31, 2021, we have specifically
reserved $35 million for our nonaccrual loans.

Average nonaccrual loans for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $105 million compared to $85 million at December 31, 2020. The increase in average
nonaccrual loans was primarily driven by organic loan growth throughout the year and the acquisition of loans from Boston Private in the third quarter of 2021, while
many paydowns occurred during the fourth quarter. If the nonaccrual loans for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 had not been nonperforming, $3 million
and $2 million, respectively, in interest income would have been recorded.

Table of Contents

Foreign Exchange Spot Contract Assets

The decrease of $2.0 billion in foreign exchange spot contract assets was primarily due to a decrease in the number of unsettled spot trades with large notional
balances at December 31, 2021 as December 31, 2020 had several large unsettled spot trades at year-end.

Accrued interest receivable

The increase of $225 million in AIR was primarily due to increases in the period-end balances of our HTM investment securities portfolio and loans at December
31, 2021 as compared to December 31, 2020.

Net deferred tax assets

Net deferred tax assets increased $23 million as our tax position changed from a payable to a receivable primarily due to the decrease in the fair value of our
AFS securities and the adoption of fair value accounting on loans and debt securities for income tax purposes as a result of the Boston Private acquisition.

Other Assets

Other assets includes various asset amounts for other operational transactions. The increase of $323 million was due primarily to $122 million increase in current
taxes receivable reflective of an overpayment of federal and state taxes, a $28 million increase in prepaid expenses, a $29 million increase in capitalized cloud
computing costs reflective of investments in systems and technology to support our revenue growth and related initiatives and the acquisition of Boston Private which
impacted several line items within other assets.

Equity Warrant Assets

In connection with negotiating credit facilities and certain other services, we often obtain rights to acquire stock in the form of equity warrant assets in primarily
private, venture-backed companies in the technology and life science/healthcare industries. At December 31, 2021, we held warrants in 2,831 companies, compared
to 2,602 companies at December 31, 2020. Warrants in 47 companies each had values greater than $1 million and collectively represented $140 million, or 50.5
percent, of the fair value of the total warrant portfolio. The change in fair value of equity warrant assets is recorded in "Gains on equity warrant assets, net", in
noninterest income, a component of consolidated net income. The following table provides a summary of transactions and valuation changes for the years ended

Foreign Exchange Forward and Foreign Currency Option Contracts

We enter into foreign exchange forward and swap contracts and foreign currency option contracts with clients involved in foreign activities, either as the
purchaser or seller, depending upon the clients' needs. For each forward, swap or option contract entered into with our clients, we enter into an opposite way
forward, swap or option contract with a correspondent bank, which mitigates the risk of fluctuations in currency rates. We also enter into forward contracts with
correspondent banks to economically reduce our foreign exchange exposure related to certain foreign currency denominated instruments. Net gains and losses on the
revaluation of foreign currency denominated instruments are recorded in the line item "Other" as part of noninterest income, a component of consolidated net
income. We have not experienced nonperformance by any of our counterparties and therefore have not incurred any related losses. Further, we anticipate
performance by all counterparties. Our net exposure for foreign exchange forward and swaps and foreign currency option contracts, net of cash collateral, was zero at
December 31, 2021 and $31 million at December 31, 2020. For additional information on our foreign exchange forward contracts and swap and foreign currency
option contracts, see Note 164<Derivative Financial Instruments= of the <Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements= under Part II, Item 8 of this report.

Client Interest Rate Derivatives

We sell interest rate contracts to clients who wish to mitigate their interest rate exposure. We economically reduce the interest rate risk from this business by
entering into opposite way contracts with correspondent banks. Our net exposure for client interest rate derivative contracts, net of cash collateral, was $47 million at
December 31, 2021 and $67 million at December 31, 2020. For additional information on our client interest rate derivatives, refer to Note 164<Derivative Financial
Instruments= of the <Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements= under Part II, Item 8 of this report.

Interest Rate Swaps

To manage interest rate risk on our AFS securities portfolio, we enter into pay-fixed, receive-floating interest rate swap contracts to hedge against exposure to
changes in the fair value of the securities resulting from changes in interest rates. We designate these interest rate swap contracts as fair value hedges that qualify for
hedge accounting under ASC 815 and record them in other assets and other liabilities. Our net exposure for interest rate swaps was $5 million at December 31, 2021.
We had zero net exposure for interest rate swaps at December 31, 2020. Refer to Note 164<Derivative Financial Instruments= of the <Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements= under Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information.

Total deposits $ 189,203 $ 101,982

The increase in deposits of $87.2 billion in 2021 was driven by growth across all portfolios with the primary contributor coming from our Technology and
healthcare portfolio driven by exits in the first half of 2021 and strong private fundraising throughout 2021. The Boston Private acquisition contributed $8.9 billion of
deposit growth. No material portion of our deposits has been obtained from a single depositor and the loss of any one depositor would not materially affect our

business. Approximately 9 percent and 12 percent of our total deposits at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, were from our clients in Asia.

At December 31, 2021, 33 percent of our total deposits were interest-bearing deposits, compared to 35 percent at December 31, 2020.
Uninsured Deposits in U.S. Offices

At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the amount of estimated uninsured deposits in U.S. offices that exceed the FDIC insurance limit were $166.0 billion and $88.6
billion, respectively. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, foreign deposits of $16.1 billion and $8.4 billion, respectively, were not subject to any U.S. federal or state

Total other liabilities $ 2,587 $ 3,972 (34.9)

(1) See <Derivatives= section above.

Foreign Exchange Spot Contract Liabilities

Foreign exchange spot contract liabilities represent unsettled client trades at the end of the period. The decrease of $2.0 billion in foreign exchange spot
contract liabilities was primarily due to a decrease in the number of unsettled spot trades with large notional balances at December 31, 2021 as December 31, 2020
had several large unsettled spot trades at year-end.

Accrued Compensation

Accrued compensation includes amounts for our Incentive Compensation Plan, Direct Drive Incentive Compensation Plan, Retention Program, Warrant Incentive
Plan, ESOP, SVB Securities Incentive Compensation Plan, SVB Securities Retention Award and other compensation arrangements. The increase of $351 million was
driven primarily by an increase in accrued incentive pay as a result of our strong 2021 full-year financial performance and an increase in the number of average FTEs in

For a description of our variable compensation plans, refer to Note 194<Employee Compensation and Benefit Plans= of the <Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements= under Part II, Item 8 of this report.
Allowance for Unfunded Credit Commitments

Allowance for unfunded credit commitments includes an allowance for both our unfunded loan commitments and our letters of credit. The increase of $50
million was attributable to commitment growth and changes in portfolio composition and an increase in the expected future commitments for milestone tranches of
Investor Dependent loans, which are tied to company performance or additional funding rounds, resulting in a longer weighted average life of these higher risk
segments. Additionally, we recorded an initial provision of $2 million related to Boston Private unfunded commitments in the third quarter of 2021.

Net Deferred Tax Liabilities

Net deferred tax liabilities decreased $173 million as our tax position changed to a net deferred tax asset position of $24 million due primarily to the decrease in
the fair value of our AFS securities and the adoption of fair value accounting on loans and debt securities for income tax purposes as a result of the Boston Private
acquisition.

Other Liabilities

Other liabilities includes various accrued liability amounts for other operational transactions. The increase of $391 million was driven primarily by $60 million of
unsettled fixed income investment securities purchases and a $112 million increase in investments payable related to investments in qualified affordable housing
projects.

Noncontrolling Interests

Noncontrolling interests totaled $373 million and $213 million at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The increase was due to net income
attributable to noncontrolling interests of $240 million, partially offset by net capital distributions of $80 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. For more
information, refer to Note 24<Summary of Significant Accounting Policies= of the <Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements= under Part II, Item 8 of this report.

Capital Resources

We maintain an adequate capital base to support anticipated asset growth, operating needs, and credit and other business risks, and to provide for SVB
Financial and the Bank to be in compliance with applicable regulatory capital guidelines, including the joint agency rules implementing the "Basel III" capital rules (the
"Capital Rules"). Our primary sources of new capital include retained earnings and proceeds from the sale and issuance of our capital stock or other securities. Under
the oversight of the Finance Committee of our Board of Directors, management engages in regular capital planning processes in an effort to optimize the use of the
capital available to us and to appropriately plan for our future capital needs. The capital plan considers capital needs for the foreseeable future and allocates capital to
both existing and future business activities. Expected future use or activities for which capital may be set aside include balance sheet growth and associated relative
increases in market or credit exposure, investment activity, potential product and business expansions, acquisitions and strategic or infrastructure investments. In
addition, we conduct capital stress tests as part of our annual capital planning process. The capital stress tests allow us to assess the impact of adverse changes in the
economy and interest rates on our capital adequacy position.

SVBFG Stockholders9 Equity

SVBFG stockholders9 equity totaled $16.2 billion at December 31, 2021, an increase of $8.0 billion, or 97.5 percent, compared to $8.2 billion at December 31,
The increase was driven primarily by a $3.4 billion issuance of common stock, of which $1.1 billion was issued to complete the acquisition of Boston Private, $3.3
billion issuance of preferred stock and $1.8 billion of net income, offset partially by the decrease in AOCI of $632 million. The decrease in AOCI was driven primarily by
a $644 million (or $465 million net of tax) decrease in the fair value of our AFS securities portfolio reflective of increases in market interest rates.
Funds generated through retained earnings are a significant source of capital and liquidity and are expected to continue to be so in the future.
Common Stock

On March 22, 2021, to support the continued growth of our balance sheet, we issued and sold 2,000,000 shares of common stock at a price of $500.00 per
share. We received net proceeds of $972 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions. On April 14, 2021, we issued and sold an additional 300,000
shares of common stock under the full exercise of the underwriter's over-allotment option resulting in additional net proceeds of approximately $146 million after
deducting discounts and commissions. On July 1, 2021, we issued 1,887,981 shares of common stock for the acquisition of Boston Private at an exchange ratio of
0.0228 SIVB shares per Boston Private share totaling $1.1 billion. On August 12, 2021, we issued and sold an additional 2,227,000 shares of common stock at an
offering price of $564.00 per share, which resulted in net proceeds of $1.2 billion.

Our risk-based capital ratios, tier 1 capital ratios and leverage ratios increased for both SVB Financial and Silicon Valley Bank as of December 31, 2021, compared
to December 31, 2020. The increase in capital ratios was driven primarily by increases in our capital, partially offset by increases in our risk-weighted and average
assets. The increase in capital for SVB Financial was driven by the issuance of common and preferred stock and net income. The increase in capital for Silicon Valley
Bank was driven by a $5.8 billion downstream capital infusion from our bank holding company during the year ended

December 31, 2021. The increase in average assets was driven by increases in our fixed income investments and loan portfolios. All of our reported capital ratios
remain above the levels considered to be <well capitalized= under applicable banking regulations.

Non-GAAP Tangible Common Equity to Tangible Assets and Non-GAAP Tangible Common Equity to Risk-weighted Assets

The tangible common equity, or tangible book value, to tangible assets ratio and the tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets ratios are not required by
GAAP or applicable bank regulatory requirements. However, we believe these ratios provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our capital levels. Our
management uses, and believes that investors benefit from referring to, these ratios in evaluating the adequacy of the Company9s capital levels; however, these
financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or preferable to, comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. The
manner in which this ratio is calculated varies among companies. Accordingly, our ratio is not necessarily comparable to similar measures of other companies. The
following table provides a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures with financial measures defined by GAAP:

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations

In the normal course of business, we use financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk to meet the financing needs of our customers. These financial
instruments include commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit and commitments to invest in venture capital and private equity fund investments. These
instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk. Credit risk is defined as the possibility of sustaining a loss because other parties to the financial
instrument fail to perform in accordance with the terms of the contract. The actual liquidity needs and the credit risk that we have experienced have historically been
lower than the contractual amount of these commitments because a significant portion of these commitments expire without being drawn upon. Refer to the
discussion of our off-balance sheet arrangements in Note 214<Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Guarantees and Other Commitments= of the <Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements= under Part II, Item 8 of this report.

Excluded from the tables above are unfunded commitment obligations of $22 million to our managed funds of funds and other fund investments for which
neither the payment, timing, nor eventual obligation is certain. Subject to applicable regulatory requirements, including the Volcker Rule (see "Business - Supervision
and Regulation" under Part I, Item 1 of this report), we make commitments to invest in venture capital and private equity funds, which in turn make investments
generally in, or in some cases make loans to, privately-held companies. Commitments to invest in these funds are generally made for a 10-year period from the
inception of the fund. Although the limited partnership agreements governing these investments typically do not restrict the general partners from calling 100% of
committed capital in one year, it is customary for these funds to generally call most of the capital commitments over 5 to 7 years; however in certain cases, the funds
may not call 100% of committed capital over the life of the fund. The actual timing of future cash requirements to fund these commitments is generally dependent
upon the investment cycle, overall market conditions, and the nature and type of industry in which the privately held companies operate. Additionally, our
consolidated managed funds of funds have $3.0 million of remaining unfunded commitments to venture capital and private equity funds. See Note 94<Investment
Securities" of the <Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements= under Part II, Item 8 of this report for further disclosure related to non-marketable and other
equity securities. Additional discussion of our off-balance sheet arrangements for these fund investments is included in Note 214<Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements,
Guarantees and Other Commitments= of the <Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements= under Part II, Item 8 of this report.

Liquidity

The objective of liquidity management is to ensure that funds are available in a timely manner to meet our financial obligations, including, as necessary, paying
creditors, meeting depositors9 needs, accommodating loan demand and growth, funding investments, repurchasing securities and other operating or capital needs,
without incurring undue cost or risk, or causing a disruption to normal operating conditions.

We regularly assess the amount and likelihood of projected funding requirements through a review of factors such as historical deposit volatility and funding
patterns, present and forecasted market and economic conditions, individual client funding needs, and existing and planned business activities. Our Asset/Liability
Committee (<ALCO=), which is a management committee, provides oversight to the liquidity management process and recommends policy guidelines for the approval
of the Finance Committee of our Board of Directors, and courses of action to address our actual and projected liquidity needs. Additionally, we routinely conduct
liquidity stress testing as part of our liquidity management practices.

88
Table of Contents

Historically, client deposits have been our primary source of liquidity. Our deposit levels and cost of deposits may fluctuate from time to time due to a variety of
factors, including market conditions, prevailing interest rates, changes in client deposit behaviors, availability of insurance protection, and our offering of deposit
products. We may also offer more investment alternatives for our off-balance sheet products which may impact deposit levels. At December 31, 2021, our period-end
total deposit balances increased to $189.2 billion, compared to $102.0 billion at December 31, 2020.

Our liquidity requirements can also be met through the use of our portfolio of liquid assets. Our definition of liquid assets includes cash and cash equivalents in
excess of the minimum levels necessary to carry out normal business operations, short-term investment securities maturing within one year, AFS securities eligible and
available for financing or pledging purposes with a maturity in excess of one year and anticipated near-term cash flows from investments.

We have certain facilities in place to enable us to access short-term borrowings on a secured and unsecured basis. Our secured facilities include collateral
pledged to the FHLB of San Francisco and the discount window at the FRB (using both fixed income securities and loans as collateral). Our unsecured facility consists of
our uncommitted federal funds lines. As of December 31, 2021, collateral pledged to the FHLB of San Francisco was comprised primarily of fixed income investment
securities and loans and had a carrying value of $7.3 billion, of which $6.3 billion was available to support additional borrowings. As of December 31, 2021, collateral
pledged to the discount window at the FRB was comprised of fixed income investment securities and had a carrying value of $0.8 billion, all of which was unused and
available to support additional borrowings. Our total unused and available borrowing capacity for our uncommitted federal funds lines totaled $2.1 billion at
December 31, 2021. Our total unused and available borrowing capacity under our master repurchase agreements with various financial institutions totaled $5.5 billion
at December 31, 2021.

Additionally, interim final capital rules issued by federal bank regulatory agencies have neutralized the regulatory capital effects of participating in the PPP, in
that loans outstanding are assessed a zero percent risk weight for regulatory capital purposes.

On a stand-alone basis, SVB Financial9s primary liquidity channels include dividends from the Bank, its portfolio of liquid assets, and its ability to raise debt and
capital. The ability of the Bank to pay dividends is subject to certain regulations described in <Business4Supervision and Regulation4Restrictions on Dividends= under
Part I, Item 1 of this report.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Interest Rate Risk Management

Market risk is defined as the risk of adverse fluctuations in the market value of financial instruments due to changes in market interest rates. Interest rate risk is
our primary market risk and can result from timing and volume differences in the repricing of our rate-sensitive assets and liabilities, widening or tightening of credit
spreads, changes in the general level of market interest rates and changes in the shape and level of the benchmark interest rates. Additionally, changes in interest
rates can influence the rate of principal prepayments on mortgage securities, which affects the rate of amortization of purchase premiums and discounts. Other
market risks include foreign currency exchange risk and equity price risk (including the effect of competition on product pricing). These risks and related impacts are
important market considerations but are inherently difficult to assess through simulation results. Consequently, simulations used to analyze the sensitivity of net
interest income to changes in interest rates will differ from actual results due to differences in the timing and frequency of rate resets, the magnitude of changes in
market rates, the impact of competition, fluctuating business conditions and the impact of strategies taken by management to mitigate these risks.

Interest rate risk is managed by our ALCO. ALCO reviews the sensitivity of the market valuation on earning assets and funding liabilities and modeled 12-month
projections of net interest income from changes in interest rates, structural changes in investment and funding portfolios, loan and deposit activity and market
conditions. Relevant metrics and guidelines, which are approved by the Finance Committee of our Board of Directors and are included in our Interest Rate Risk Policy,
are monitored on an ongoing basis.

Interest rate risk is managed primarily through strategies involving our fixed income securities portfolio, available funding channels and capital market activities.
In addition, our policies permit the use of off-balance sheet derivatives, such as interest rate swaps, to assist with managing interest rate risk.

We utilize a simulation model to perform sensitivity analysis on the EVE and net interest income under a variety of interest rate scenarios, balance sheet
forecasts and business strategies. The simulation model provides a dynamic assessment of interest rate sensitivity which is embedded within our balance sheet. Rate
sensitivity measures the potential variability in economic value and net interest income relating solely to changes in market interest rates over time. We review our
interest rate risk position and sensitivity to market interest rates regularly.

Model Simulation and Sensitivity Analysis

A specific application of our simulation model involves measurement of the impact of changes in market interest rates on the economic value of equity EVE. EVE
is defined as the market value of assets, less the market value of liabilities. Another application of the simulation model measures the impact of changes in market
interest rates on NII assuming a static balance sheet, in both size and composition, as of the period-end reporting date. In the NII simulation, the level of market
interest rates and the size and composition of the balance sheet are held constant over the simulation horizon. Simulated cash flows during the scenario horizon are
assumed to be replaced as they occur, which maintains the balance sheet at its current size and composition. Yield and spread assumptions on cash and investment
balances reflect current market rates and the shape of the yield curve. Yield and spread assumptions on loans reflect recent market impacts on product pricing.
Similarly, we make certain deposit balance decay rate assumptions on demand deposits and interest-bearing deposits, which are replenished to hold the level and mix
of funding liabilities constant. Changes in market interest rates that affect net interest income are principally short-term interest rates and include the following
benchmark indexes: (i) the National Prime Rate, (ii) 1-month and 3-month LIBOR and (iii) the Federal Funds target rate. Although we ceased offering LIBOR-based loans
as of December 31, 2021, our simulation results will reflect changes in LIBOR rates until publication rates are fully phased out. Changes in these short-term rates
impact interest earned on our variable rate loans and balances held as cash and cash equivalents. Additionally, simulated changes in deposit pricing relative to changes
in market rates, commonly referred to as deposit beta, generally follow overall changes in short-term interest rates, although actual changes may lag in terms of
timing and magnitude.

Both EVE and NII measures rely upon the use of models to simulate cash flow behavior for loans and deposits. These models were developed internally and are
based on historical balance and rate observations. Investment portfolio cash flow is based on a combination of third-party prepayment models and internally managed
prepayment vectors depending on security type. As part of our ongoing governance structure, each of these models and assumptions are periodically reviewed and
recalibrated as needed to ensure that they are representative of our understanding of existing behaviors.

Simulation results presented include a beta assumption that is applied in the NII and EVE simulation models for interest-bearing deposits. This reflects
management expectations about deposit repricing behavior. This model assumes the overall beta for interest-bearing deposits is approximately 60 percent. That is,
overall changes in interest-bearing deposit rates would be approximately 60 percent of the change in short-term market rates. These repricing assumptions are
reflected as changes in interest expense on interest-bearing deposit balances.

The acquisition of Boston Private was completed in July 2021. The acquisition added approximately $10 billion of total assets and $9 billion of deposits to the
balance sheet. Most of the assets added were fixed and variable rate residential mortgages and commercial loans. Both the EVE and NII sensitivity measures described
here are inclusive of the impact of the Boston Private acquisition.

The following table presents our EVE and NII sensitivity exposure related to an instantaneous and sustained parallel shift in market interest rates of 100 and 200

Economic Value of Equity

The estimated EVE in the preceding table is based on a combination of valuation methodologies including a discounted cash flow analysis and a multi-path
lattice-based valuation. Both methodologies use publicly available market interest rates to determine discounting factors on projected cash flows. The model
simulations and calculations are highly assumption-dependent and will change regularly as the composition of earning assets and funding liabilities change (including
the impact of changes in the value of interest rate derivatives, if any), as interest rate environments evolve, and as we change our assumptions in response to relevant
market conditions, competition or business circumstances. These calculations do not reflect forecast changes in our balance sheet or changes we may make to reduce
our EVE exposure as a part of our overall interest rate risk management strategy.

As with any method of measuring interest rate risk, certain limitations are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the preceding table. We are exposed
to yield curve risk, prepayment risk, basis risk and yield spread compression, which cannot be fully modeled and expressed using the above methodology. Accordingly,
the results in the preceding table should not be relied upon as a precise indicator of actual results in the event of changing market interest rates. Additionally, the
resulting EVE and NII estimates are not intended to represent and should not be construed to represent our estimate of the underlying EVE or forecast of NII.

Our base EVE as of December 31, 2021 increased $9.5 billion from December 31, 2020, driven by overall balance sheet growth as well as yield curve steepening
during the first half of 2021. For the period ended December 31, 2021, compared to December 31, 2020, cash balances decreased by $3.1 billion, fixed income
investments in our AFS portfolio decreased by $3.7 billion, while HTM portfolio balances increased by $81.6 billion and loan balances increased by $21.1 billion.
Funding for these assets came primarily from growth of $87.2 billion in total deposits, which consisted of a $59.3 billion and $27.9 billion increase in non-interest
bearing and interest bearing accounts, respectively. The mix of non-interest bearing to total deposits increased slightly by 2 percent from 65 at December 31, 2020, to
67 percent at December 31, 2021.

Rapid deposit growth has exceeded the pace of our loan growth, and as a result, a significant amount of excess deposits not used to fund loan growth have
contributed to the growth of investment balances. Much of the investment portfolio is held in fixed rate MBS and CMOs which generally have a higher market value
sensitivity than variable rate loans or cash. Thus, under an upward rate shock scenario, the market value of investments changes more than the market value of
deposits resulting in a negative EVE sensitivity in those scenarios.

In March 2021 we purchased interest rate swaps to offset some of the additional EVE sensitivity that has resulted from rapid balance sheet growth. As of
December 31, 2021, the estimated change in EVE in an up to 100 bps rate shock would be

-15.4 percent without any hedging applied. The addition of pay fixed swaps reduces this exposure to -13.9 percent in the same scenario. The EVE exposures shown in
the table above include the impact of our hedging activity.

12-Month Net Interest Income Simulation

NII sensitivity is measured as the percentage change in projected 12-month net interest income earned in +/-100 and +/-200 basis point interest rate shock
scenarios compared to a base scenario where balances and interest rates are held constant over the forecast horizon. At December 31,2021, NII sensitivity was 10.9
percent in the +100 bps interest rate scenario, compared to 15.1 percent at December 31, 2020. Our NII sensitivity in the +200 bps interest rate shock scenario was
22.9 percent compared to 29.2 percent at December 31, 2020. NII sensitivity in the -100 bps scenario of negative 6.4 percent was higher at December 31, 2021,
compared to a negative 2.6 percent at December 31, 2020. The -200 bps scenario currently indicates a higher percentage change in NII of negative 8.6 percent at
December 31, 2021, compared to negative 2.8 percent at December 31, 2020. However, as noted above, the -100 and -200 bps scenarios are not complete rate shocks
in this rate environment, since rates are assumed to be floored at zero. The December 31, 2021 NII sensitivity percentages are inclusive of the realized income or
expense associated with interest rate swaps that were unwound reflective of the macro hedging process initiated in 2019 to reduce the impact of decreasing rates on
NII as well as unrealized income associated with more recent hedging activity that has been undertaken to reduce EVE exposure. The changes in NII sensitivity are
primarily the result of the changes in balance sheet composition described previously, combined with the impact of hedges in the respective parallel rate shock
scenarios.

Our base case static 12-month NII forecast at December 31, 2021 increased compared to December 31, 2020 by $1.9 billion, driven primarily by the growth in
the balance sheet that has taken place year-to-date. Specifically, a large portion of asset growth has been deployed in the fixed income investment securities portfolio
as noted above. As of December 31, 2021, we also held a relatively high cash position which is expected to decrease as excess funds are invested.

A majority of our loans are indexed to Prime and LIBOR. Despite no longer offering LIBOR-based loans as of December 31, 2021, we have begun offering loans
based on SOFR and other recognized alternative reference rates. Additionally, despite no longer offering new LIBOR-based loans, our simulation result will reflect
changes in LIBOR until the published rates are phased out. In the upward parallel simulated rate shock scenarios, interest income on assets that are tied to variable
rate indexes, primarily our variable rate loans, are expected to benefit our base 12-month NII projections. The opposite is true for downward rate shock scenarios.

The 12-month NII simulations include repricing assumptions on our interest-bearing deposit products which we set at our discretion based on client needs and
our overall funding mix. Repricing of interest-bearing deposits impacts estimated interest expense.

For the interest rate scenarios, the simulation model incorporates embedded rate floors on loans, where present, which prevents model benchmark rates from
moving below zero percent in the down rate scenarios. The embedded rate floors are also a factor in the up-rate scenarios to the extent a simulated increase in rates
is needed before floored rates are cleared. In addition, we assume deposit balance decay rates based on a historical deposit study of our clients. These assumptions
may change in future periods based on changes in client behavior and at management's discretion. Actual changes in our deposit pricing strategies may differ from our
current model assumptions and may have an impact on our actual sensitivity overall.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and Board of Directors
SVB Financial Group:

Opinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of SVB Financial Group and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the
related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders9 equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company9s internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control 3 Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December
31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2021 based on criteria established in Internal Control 3 Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission.

The Company acquired Boston Private Financial Holdings, Inc. during 2021, and management excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of the Company9s
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, Boston Private Financial Holdings, Inc9s internal control over financial reporting associated with
approximately 2% of total consolidated revenue and approximately 4% of total consolidated assets included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company
as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also excluded an evaluation of the internal
control over financial reporting of Boston Private Financial Holdings, Inc.

Change in Accounting Principle

As discussed in Notes 2 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for the recognition and measurement of
credit losses as of January 1, 2020 due to the adoption of ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial
Instruments (CECL).

Basis for Opinions

The Company9s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company9s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company9s internal control over
financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and
are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal
control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial
statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial
reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company9s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company9s internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures

95
Table of Contents

that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company9s assets that
could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with
the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or
required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2)
involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the
consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical
audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Allowance for credit losses for loans and unfunded loan commitments for certain portfolio segments evaluated on a collective basis
As discussed in Notes 2 and 10 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company9s allowance for credit losses for loans (ALL) and unfunded credit
commitments (AUCC) were $422 million and $171 million as of December 31, 2021, respectively. The allowance principally relates to the Company9s loans
and unfunded loan commitments evaluated on a collective basis (the collective ALL and the collective AULC, respectively). The collective ALL and the
collective AULC include the measure of expected credit losses on a collective (pooled) basis for those loans and unfunded loan commitments that share
similar risk characteristics. The Company estimated the collective ALL using a current expected credit losses methodology based on relevant information
about historical experience, the current macroeconomic environment, and reasonable and supportable economic forecasts that affect the collectability of the
loan balances. The quantitative expected credit losses are the product of multiplying the Company9s estimates of probability of default (PD), loss given default
(LGD), and individual loan level exposure at default (EAD) on an undiscounted basis. The Company derives the PD, LGD, and EAD from internal historical
default and loss experience adjusted for multiple probability-weighted economic forecast scenarios of macroeconomic assumptions over a reasonable and
supportable forecast period of three years. After the reasonable and supportable forecast period, the Company reverts to historical averages using an
autoregressive method of mean reversion that trends towards the mean historical loss over the remaining contractual lives, adjusted for prepayments. The
Company also applies certain qualitative adjustments to the results of its quantitative model for asset-specific risk characteristics, and current conditions and
reasonable and supportable forecasts based on its expectation of the risks that may lead to future loan loss experience different from its historical loan loss
experience. These adjustments are based on qualitative factors not reflected in the quantitative model but are expected to impact the estimate of credit
losses. In order to capture the unique risks of the loan portfolio within the PD, LGD, EAD model, the Company segments the portfolio into pools and by credit
risk rating. The Company estimated the collective AULC using a similar methodology as the collective ALL adjusted by the probability of an unfunded loan
commitment being funded. Certain qualitative adjustments to historical loss information are also applied to the collective AULC.
We identified the assessment of the December 31, 2021 collective ALL and collective AULC for the Global Funds Banking, Investor Dependent, Cash Flow
Dependent & Innovation C&I, Premium Wine, and legacy Private Bank portfolio segments as a critical audit matter. A high degree of audit effort, including
specialized skills and knowledge, and subjective and complex auditor judgment was involved in the assessment due to measurement uncertainty. Specifically,
the assessment encompassed the evaluation of the methodology, including the methods and model used to estimate (1) the PD, LGD, and EAD and their
significant assumptions and inputs, and (2) certain qualitative adjustments. Significant assumptions and inputs include the economic forecast scenarios of
macroeconomic assumptions and their weightings, the historical observation period, portfolio segmentation, and credit risk ratings. The assessment also
included an evaluation of the conceptual soundness and performance of the PD, LGD, and EAD model. Auditor judgment was required to evaluate the
sufficiency of audit evidence obtained.
The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness
of certain internal controls related to the Company's measurement of the December 31, 2021 collective ALL and collective AULC estimates, including controls
over the:
" periodic review and monitoring of the collective ALL and the collective AULC methodology
96
Table of Contents

" identification and determination of significant assumptions used in the PD, LGD, and EAD model
" evaluation of the qualitative adjustments, including significant assumptions used in the measurement of the qualitative adjustments
" determination of credit risk ratings
" analysis of the collective ALL and collective AULC results, trends, and ratios.
We evaluated the Company9s process to develop the December 31, 2021 collective ALL and collective AULC estimates by testing certain sources of data,
qualitative factors and assumptions that the Company used, and considered the relevance and reliability of such data, qualitative factors, and assumptions. In
addition, we involved credit risk professionals with specialized skills and knowledge who assisted in:
" evaluating the Company9s collective ALL and collective AULC methodology and key assumptions for compliance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles
" assessing the conceptual soundness and performance of the PD, LGD, and EAD model by inspecting the model documentation to determine
whether the model is suitable for the intended use
" evaluating the methodology used to develop the qualitative factors and the effect of those factors on the collective ALL and the collective AULC
compared with relevant credit risk factors and consistency with credit trends associated with the Company9s portfolio
" evaluating the historical observation period, focusing on the relevance of the full economic cycle relative to the Company9s current portfolio
" evaluating the approach to incorporate macroeconomic forecast assumptions in the PD, LGD, EAD model with respect to the Company9s
business environment and the loan products used across the industry
" evaluating model validation findings and assessing their possible impact, if any
" determining whether the loan portfolio is segmented by similar risk characteristics by comparing to the Company9s business and environment
and relevant industry practices
" testing individual credit risk ratings for a selection of loan and unfunded loan commitment borrower relationships by evaluating the financial
performance of the borrower, sources of repayment, and any relevant guarantees or underlying collateral, as applicable.
We also assessed the sufficiency of the audit evidence obtained related to the December 31, 2021 collective ALL and collective AULC estimates by evaluating
the:
" cumulative results of the audit procedures
" qualitative aspects of the Company9s accounting practices
" potential bias in the accounting estimates.

SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. Nature of Business

SVB Financial Group is a diversified financial services company, as well as a bank holding company and a financial holding company. SVB Financial was
incorporated in the state of Delaware in March 1999. Through our various subsidiaries and divisions, we offer a diverse set of banking and financial products and
services to support our clients of all sizes and stages throughout their life cycles. In these notes to our consolidated financial statements, when we refer to <SVB
Financial Group,= <SVBFG=, the <Company,= <we,= <our,= <us= or use similar words, we mean SVB Financial Group and all of its subsidiaries collectively, including
Silicon Valley Bank (the <Bank=), unless the context requires otherwise. When we refer to <SVB Financial= or the <Parent= we are referring only to the parent company
entity, SVB Financial Group (not including subsidiaries).

We offer commercial banking products and services through our principal subsidiary, the Bank, which is a California-chartered bank founded in 1983 and a
member of the Federal Reserve System. Through its subsidiaries, the Bank also offers asset management, private wealth management and other investment services.
In addition, through SVB Financial's other subsidiaries and divisions, we offer investment banking and non-banking products and services, such as funds management
and M&A advisory services. We primarily focus on serving corporate clients in the following industries: technology, life science/healthcare, private equity/venture
capital and premium wine. Our corporate clients range widely in terms of size and stage of maturity. Additionally, we focus on cultivating strong relationships with
firms within the venture capital and private equity community worldwide, many of which are also our clients and may invest in our corporate clients.

Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, we operate in centers of innovation in the United States and around the world.
For reporting purposes, SVB Financial Group has four operating segments for which we report financial information in this report: GCB, SVB Private Bank, SVB
Capital and SVB Securities.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Use of Estimates and Assumptions

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates may change as new information is obtained. Among
the more significant estimates are those that relate to: 1) ACL for loans and for unfunded credit commitments, 2) valuation of non-marketable and other equity
securities, 3) valuation of equity warrant assets, 4) goodwill, intangible assets and other purchase accounting related adjustments and 5) income taxes.

Principles of Consolidation and Presentation

Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of SVB Financial Group and consolidated entities. We consolidate entities in which we have a
controlling financial interest. Before we determine whether we have a controlling financial interest, we must evaluate whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a
variable interest entity ("VIE").

VIEs are entities where investors lack sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support and, as a
group, lack one of the following characteristics: (a) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity9s economic performance, (b) the
obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity or (c) the right to receive the expected returns of the entity.

We are considered to hold a controlling financial interest in a VIE when we are the primary beneficiary. A primary beneficiary is the party that has both: (a) the
power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE9s economic performance, and (b) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits of a VIE that
could potentially be significant to a VIE. Generally, the parties that make management and investment decisions, or parties that can unilaterally remove such decision-
makers are deemed to have the power to direct the activities of a VIE. When assessing whether we have the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits
from the VIE, we consider all of our economic interests in the VIE, including any fees and other compensation received for providing investment and management
services if that compensation is not customary and commensurate with the services provided.

Voting interest entities are entities that (a) have sufficient equity to finance their activities and (b) provide the equity investors power to make significant
decisions relating to the entity9s operations. For such entities, we have a controlling financial interest if we hold a majority of voting rights.

SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

All significant intercompany accounts and transactions with consolidated entities have been eliminated.
Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, cash balances due from banks, interest-earning deposits, Federal Reserve deposits, federal funds sold,
securities purchased under agreements to resell and other short-term investment securities. For the consolidated statements of cash flows, we consider cash
equivalents to be investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, so near to their maturity that they present an insignificant risk of change in fair
value due to changes in market interest rates, and purchased in conjunction with our cash management activities.

Investment Securities

Available-for-Sale Securities and the Allowance for Credit Losses on Available-for-Sale Securities

Our AFS securities portfolio is a fixed income investment portfolio that is managed to earn an appropriate portfolio yield over the long-term while maintaining
sufficient liquidity and credit diversification and meeting our asset and liability management objectives. The accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums over
the contractual terms of the underlying securities are included in interest income. We use estimates of future principal prepayments when applying the effective
interest method to prepayable securities.

Unrealized gains and losses on AFS securities, net of applicable taxes, are reported in AOCI, a separate component of SVBFG's stockholders' equity. Impairment
losses on AFS securities are recognized through earnings when we intend to sell an AFS security, or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security
before recovery of its amortized cost. Additionally, we evaluate whether a credit loss exists for securities that we intend to hold. We consider all factors in determining
whether a credit loss exists, including the period over which the debt security is expected to recover. A credit impairment is recognized through a valuation allowance
against the security with an offset through earnings. The allowance is limited to the amount that fair value is less than the amortized cost basis.

Held-to-Maturity Securities and the Allowance for Credit Losses on Held-to-Maturity Securities

Debt securities purchased with the positive intent and ability to hold to its maturity are classified as HTM securities and are recorded at amortized cost, net of
any ACL.

Effective January 1, 2020, we measure ECL on HTM securities on a collective basis by major security type and standard credit rating. Certain securities in our HTM
securities portfolio are either explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government, are highly rated by major rating agencies and have a long history of no credit
losses. With respect to these securities, we consider the risk of credit loss to be zero and, therefore, we do not record an ECL.

The estimate of ECL on our HTM securities that are not guaranteed by the U.S. government considers historical credit loss information and severity of loss in the
event of default and leverages external data adjusted for current conditions. A reasonable and supportable forecast period of one year is applied, with immediate
reversion to long-term average historical loss rates when remaining contractual lives of securities exceed one year. We do not estimate ECL on AIR from HTM
securities as AIR is reversed or written off when the full collection of the AIR related to a security becomes doubtful. AIR from HTM securities totaled $225 million at
December 31, 2021 and $55 million at December 31, 2020 and is excluded from the amortized cost disclosures within our HTM security disclosures in Note 9
4<Investment Securities= as it is included and reported separately within "Accrued interest receivable and other assets" in our consolidated balance sheets.

ECL on bonds that do not share common risk characteristics with our collective portfolio are individually measured based on net realizable value, or the
difference between the discounted value of the expected future cash flows and the recorded amortized cost basis of the security.

Transfers of investment securities into the HTM category from the AFS category are made at fair value at the date of transfer. The net unrealized gains, net of
tax, are retained in other comprehensive income, and the carrying value of the HTM securities are amortized over the life of the securities in a manner consistent with
the amortization of a premium or discount.

Non-Marketable and Other Equity Securities

Non-marketable and other equity securities include investments in venture capital and private equity funds, SPD-SVB, debt funds, private and public portfolio
companies, including public equity securities held as a result of equity warrant assets exercised, and investments in qualified affordable housing projects. A majority of
these investments are managed through our SVB Capital funds business in funds of funds and direct venture funds. Our accounting for investments in non-marketable
and other equity securities depends on several factors, including the level of ownership, power to control and the legal structure of the subsidiary making the
investment. As further described below, we base our accounting for such securities on: (i) fair value accounting, (ii) measurement alternative for other investments
without a readily determinable fair value, (iii) equity

104
Table of Contents
SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

method accounting and (iv) the proportional amortization method which is used only for qualified affordable housing projects.

Fair Value Accounting

Our consolidated managed funds qualify as investment companies and therefore report their investments at estimated fair value, with unrealized gains and
losses reflected as gains on investment securities, net, a component of noninterest income. The portion of any investment gains or losses attributable to other limited
partners is reflected as net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and adjusts our net income to reflect its percentage ownership. Our consolidated managed
funds of funds make investments in venture capital and private equity funds. A summary of our ownership interests in such funds as of December 31, 2021 is
presented in the following table:

Limited partnership

Company Direct and Indirect Ownership
in Limited Partnership
Managed funds of funds
Strategic Investors Fund, LP 12.6 %
Capital Preferred Return Fund, LP 20.0
Growth Partners, LP 33.0

Our direct investments in public portfolio companies are valued based on quoted market prices less a discount if the securities are subject to certain security
specific sale restrictions. Gains or losses resulting from changes in the net asset value are recorded as gains on investment securities, net, a component of noninterest
income.

Other Investments without a Readily Determinable Fair Value

Our direct investments in private companies do not have a readily determinable fair value. We measure these investments at cost less impairment, if any, plus or
minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments from the same issuer. Such changes are recognized
through earnings. We consider a range of factors when adjusting the fair value of these investments, including, but not limited to, the term and nature of the
investment, local market conditions, values for comparable securities, current and projected operating performance, financing transactions subsequent to the
acquisition of the investment and a discount for certain investments that have lock-up restrictions or other features that indicate a discount to fair value is warranted.

Our investments in unconsolidated funds where we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over their operating and financial policies are valued
using the net asset value as obtained from the general partners of the fund investments because the funds do not have a readily determinable fair value. The general
partners of these funds prepare their financial statements using guidance consistent with fair value accounting. We account for differences between our measurement
date and the date of the fund investment's net asset value by using the most recent available financial information from the investee general partner, for example
September 30th, for our December 31st consolidated financial statements. We adjust the value of our investments for any contributions paid, distributions received
from the investment and known significant fund transactions or market events about which we are aware through information provided by the fund managers or from
publicly available transaction data during the reporting period. Gains or losses resulting from changes in the net asset value are recorded as gains on investment
securities, net, a component of noninterest income.

Equity Method

Our equity method non-marketable securities consist of investments in venture capital and private equity funds, privately-held companies, debt funds, and joint
ventures. Our equity method non-marketable securities and related accounting policies are described as follows:

" Equity securities and investments in limited partnerships, such as preferred or common stock in privately-held companies in which we have the ability to
exercise significant influence over the investees' operating and financial policies through voting interests, board involvement or other influence are
accounted for under the equity method, and
" The Bank's joint venture bank in China (SPD-SVB), for which we have 50 percent ownership, is accounted for under the equity method.
We recognize our proportionate share of the results of operations of these equity method investees in our results of operations, based on the most current
financial information available from the investee. We review our investments accounted for under the equity method at least quarterly for possible other-than-
temporary impairment. Our review typically includes an analysis of facts and circumstances for each investment, the expectations of the investment's future cash
flows and capital needs, variability of its business and the company's exit strategy. For our fund investments, we use the net asset

105
Table of Contents
SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

value per share as provided by the general partners of the fund investments. We account for differences between our measurement date and the date of the fund
investment's net asset value by using the most recent available financial information from the investee general partner, for example September 30, for our
December 31 consolidated financial statements. We adjust the value of our investments for any contributions paid, distributions received from the investment, and
known significant fund transactions or market events about which we are aware through information provided by the fund managers or from publicly available
transaction data during the reporting period.

We reduce our investment value when we consider declines in value to be other-than-temporary and recognize the estimated loss as a loss on investment
securities, a component of noninterest income.

Proportional Amortization Method

In order to fulfill our responsibilities under the CRA, we invest as a limited partner in low income housing partnerships that operate qualified affordable housing
projects and generate tax benefits, including federal low income housing tax credits, for investors. The partnerships are deemed to be VIEs because they do not have
sufficient equity investment at risk and are structured with non-substantive voting rights. We are not the primary beneficiary of the VIEs and do not consolidate them.
Our investments in low income housing partnerships are recorded in non-marketable and other equity securities within our investment securities portfolio on the
consolidated balance sheet. As a practical expedient, we amortize the investment in proportion to the allocated tax benefits under the proportional amortization
method of accounting and present such benefits net of investment amortization in income tax expense.

Loans

Loans are reported at amortized cost which consists of the principal amount outstanding, net of unearned loan fees. Unearned loan fees reflect unamortized
deferred loan origination and commitment fees net of unamortized deferred loan origination costs. In addition to cash loan fees, we often obtain equity warrant
assets that give us an option to purchase a position in a client company's stock in consideration for providing credit facilities. The grant date fair values of these equity
warrant assets are deemed to be loan fees and are deferred as unearned income and recognized as an adjustment of loan yield through loan interest income. The net
amount of unearned loan fees is amortized into loan interest income over the contractual terms of the underlying loans and commitments using the constant effective
yield method, adjusted for actual loan prepayment experience, or the straight-line method, as applicable.

Allowance for Credit Losses

The allowance for credit losses for loans considers credit risk and is adjusted by a provision for ECL charged to expense and reduced by the charge-off of loan
amounts, net of recoveries. Our allowance for credit losses is an estimate of expected losses inherent with the Company's existing loans at the balance sheet date.
Determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.

Loan Portfolio Segments and Classes of Financing Receivables

The process to estimate the ECL on loans involves procedures to appropriately consider the unique characteristics of our loan portfolio. Our eight portfolio
segments are determined by using the following risk dimensions: (i) underwriting methodology, (ii) industry niche and (iii) life stage. The eight portfolio segments are
further disaggregated into eleven classes of financing receivable, or risk-based segments, and represents the level at which credit risk is monitored. Credit quality is
assessed and monitored by evaluating various attributes and the results of those evaluations are utilized in underwriting new loans and in our process to estimate ECL.
For further information refer to Note 94<Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses: Loans and Unfunded Credit Commitments.= Upon completing the acquisition of
Boston Private, we evaluated the impact of the acquired loan portfolio on our existing portfolio segments and classes of financing receivables. We have modified both
levels of disaggregation to accommodate Boston Private loans. The following provides additional information regarding our portfolio segments and classes of financing
receivables:

" Global Fund Banking (segment and class) 3 The vast majority of our GFB portfolio segment consists of capital call lines of credit, the repayment of which is
dependent on the payment of capital calls by the underlying limited partner investors in funds managed by certain private equity and venture capital firms.
" Investor Dependent (segment) 3 Loans are made primarily to technology and life science/healthcare companies. These borrowers typically have modest or
negative cash flows and rarely have an established record of profitable operations. Repayment of these loans may be dependent upon receipt by borrowers
of additional equity financing from venture capital firms or other investors, or in some cases, a successful sale to a third party or an IPO. This portfolio
segment is further disaggregated into two classes of financing receivables:
ç Early-Stage (class) 3 Loans to pre-revenue, development-stage companies and companies that are in the early phases of commercialization, with
revenues of up to $5 million.
th
st
106
Table of Contents
SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

ç Growth Stage (class) 3 Loans to growth-stage enterprises. We consider companies with revenues between $5 million and $15 million, or pre-revenue
clinical-stage biotechnology companies, to be Mid-Stage, and companies with revenues in excess of $15 million to be Later Stage.
" Cash Flow Dependent and Innovation C&I (segment) 3 Loans are made primarily to technology and life science/healthcare companies that are not Investor
Dependent, i.e. repayment is not dependent on additional equity financing, a successful sale or an IPO. This portfolio segment consists of two classes of
financing receivables:
ç Cash Flow Dependent 3 SLBO (class) 3 Loans are typically used to assist a select group of private equity sponsors with the acquisition of businesses,
are larger in size, and repayment is generally dependent upon the cash flows of the combined entities. Acquired companies are typically established,
later-stage businesses of scale and characterized by reasonable levels of leverage with loan structures that include meaningful financial covenants.
The sponsor9s equity contribution is often 50 percent or more of the acquisition price.
ç Innovation C&I (class) 3 Other C&I loans in innovation sectors such as technology and life science/healthcare industries. These loans are dependent
on either the borrower9s cash flows or balance sheet for repayment. Cash flow dependent loans require the borrower to maintain cash flow from
operations that is sufficient to service all debt. Borrowers must demonstrate normalized cash flow in excess of all fixed charges associated with
operating the business. Balance sheet dependent loans include asset-based loans and are structured to require constant current asset coverage (i.e.
cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and, to a much lesser extent, inventory) in an amount that exceeds the outstanding debt. The
repayment of these arrangements is dependent on the financial condition, and payment ability, of third parties with whom our clients do business.
" Private Bank (segment and class) 3 Loans to our Private Bank clients who are primarily private equity/venture capital professionals and executives in the
innovation companies as well as high net worth clients acquired from Boston Private. We offer a customized suite of private banking services, including
mortgages, home equity lines of credit, restricted and private stock loans, personal capital call lines of credit, lines of credit against liquid assets and other
secured and unsecured lending products. In addition, we provide owner occupied commercial mortgages to Private Bank clients and real estate secured loans
to eligible employees through our EHOP.
" CRE (segment and class) 3 Generally acquisition financing loans for commercial properties such as office buildings, retail properties, apartment buildings, and
industrial/warehouse space.
" Other C&I (segment and class) 3 Loans that include working capital and revolving lines of credit, as well as term loans for equipment and fixed assets. These
loans are primarily to clients that are not in the technology and life sciences/healthcare industries. Additionally, this portfolio segment contains commercial
tax-exempt loans to not-for-profit private schools, colleges, public charter schools and other not-for-profit organizations.
" Premium Wine and Other (segment) 3 This portfolio segment consists of two classes of financing receivables:
ç Premium Wine (class) 3 Loans to wine producers, vineyards and wine industry or hospitality businesses across the Western United States. A large
portion of these loans are secured by real estate collateral such as vineyards and wineries.
ç Other (class) 3 Primarily construction and land loans for financing new developments as well as financing for improvements to existing buildings.
These also include our community development loans made as part of our responsibilities under the CRA.
" PPP (segment and class) 3 Combined loans issued through the PPP. These loans represent clients across all portfolio segments and are guaranteed by the SBA.
107
Table of Contents
SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

We maintain a systematic process for the evaluation of individual loans and portfolio segments for inherent risk of estimated credit losses for loans. At the time
of approval, each loan in our portfolio is assigned a credit risk rating. Credit risk ratings are assigned on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 representing loans with a low risk of
nonpayment, 9 representing loans with the highest risk of nonpayment and 10 representing loans which have been charged-off. The credit risk ratings for each loan
are monitored and updated on an ongoing basis. This credit risk rating process includes, but is not limited to, consideration of such factors as payment status, the
financial condition and operating performance of the borrower, borrower compliance with loan covenants, underlying collateral values and performance trends, the
degree of access to additional capital, the presence of credit enhancements such as third party guarantees (where applicable), the degree to which the borrower is
sensitive to external factors and the depth and experience of the borrower's management team. Our policies require a committee of senior management to review, at
least quarterly, credit relationships with a credit risk rating of 5 through 9 that exceed specific dollar values.

Expected Credit Loss Measurement

The methodology for estimating the amount of ECL reported in the ACL is the sum of two main components: (1) ECL assessed on a collective basis for pools of
loans that share similar risk characteristics which includes a qualitative adjustment based on management9s assessment of the risks that may lead to a future loan loss
experience different from our historical loan loss experience and (2) ECL assessed for individual loans that do not share similar risk characteristics with other loans. We
do not estimate ECL on AIR on loans as AIR is reversed or written off when the full collection of the AIR related to a loan becomes doubtful, which is when loans are
placed on nonaccrual status. AIR on loans totaled $171 million at December 31, 2021 and $126 million at December 31, 2020 and is excluded from the amortized cost
disclosures in Note 104<Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses: Loans and Unfunded Credit Commitments=, as it is included and reported separately within "Accrued
interest receivable and other assets" in our consolidated balance sheets.

While the evaluation process of our ACL on loans uses historical and other objective information, the classification of loans and the estimate of the ACL for loans
rely on the judgment and experience of our management. A committee comprised of senior management evaluates the appropriateness of the ACL for loans, which
includes review of loan portfolio segmentation, quantitative models, internal and external data inputs, economic forecasts, credit risk ratings and qualitative
adjustments.

Loans That Share Similar Risk Characteristics with Other Loans

We derive an estimated ECL assumption from a non-discounted cash flow approach based on our portfolio segments discussed above. This approach
incorporates a calculation of three predictive metrics: (1) PD, (2) LGD and (3) EAD, over the estimated life of the exposure. PD and LGD assumptions are developed
based on quantitative models and inherent risk of credit loss, both of which involve significant judgment. Renewals and extensions within our control are not
considered in the estimated contractual term of a loan. However, we include potential extensions if management has a reasonable expectation that we will execute a
TDR with the borrower. The quantitative models are based on historical credit loss experience, adjusted for probability-weighted economic scenarios. These scenarios
are used to support a reasonable and supportable forecast period of three years for all portfolio segments. To the extent the remaining contractual lives of loans in the
portfolio extend beyond this three-year period, we revert to historical averages using an autoregressive method of mean reversion that will continue to gradually
trend towards the mean historical loss over the remaining contractual lives of loans, adjusted for prepayments. The macroeconomic scenarios are reviewed on a
quarterly basis.

We also apply a qualitative factor adjustment to the results obtained through our quantitative ECL models to consider model imprecision, emerging risk
assessments, trends and other subjective factors that may not be adequately represented in quantitative ECL models. These adjustments to historical loss information
are for asset specific risk characteristics, and also reflect our assessment of the extent that current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts differ from
conditions that existed during the period over which historical information was evaluated. These adjustments are aggregated to become our qualitative allocation.
Based on our qualitative assessment estimate of changing risks in the lending environment, the qualitative allocation may vary significantly from period to period and
may include, but is not limited to, consideration of the following factors:

" Changes in lending policies and procedures, including changes in underwriting standards and collection, charge-off, and recovery practices not considered
elsewhere in estimating credit losses;
" Changes in international, national, regional, and local economic and business conditions and developments that affect the collectability of the portfolio,
including the condition of various market segments;
" Changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio and in the terms of loans;
" Changes in the experience, ability and depth of lending management and other relevant staff;
" Changes in the volume and severity of past due loans, the volume of nonaccrual loans and the volume and severity of adversely classified or graded loans;

Loans That Do Not Share Similar Risk Characteristics

We monitor our loan pools to ensure all assets therein continue to share similar risk characteristics with other financial assets inside the pool. Changes in credit
risk, borrower circumstances or the recognition of write-offs may indicate that a loan's risk profile has changed, and the asset should be removed from its current
pool. For a loan that does not share risk characteristics with other loans, ECL is measured based on the net realizable value, that is, the difference between the
discounted value of the expected future cash flows and the amortized cost basis of the loan. When a loan is collateral-dependent and the repayment is expected to be
provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral, the ECL is measured as the difference between the amortized cost basis of the loan and the fair
value of the collateral. The fair value of the collateral will be determined by the most recent appraisal, as adjusted to reflect a reasonable marketing period for the sale
of the asset(s) and an estimate of reasonable selling expenses. Collateral-dependent loans will have independent appraisals completed and accepted at least annually.

Allowance for Credit Losses: Unfunded Credit Commitments

We maintain a separate ACL for unfunded credit commitments which is included in other liabilities and the related ECL in our provision for credit losses. We
estimate the amount of expected losses by using historical trends to calculate a probability of an unfunded credit commitment being funded and derive historical
lifetime expected loss factors for each portfolio segment similar to our funded loan ECL. The collectively assessed ECL for unfunded credit commitments also includes
the same qualitative allocations applied for our funded loan ECL. For unfunded credit commitments related to loans that do not share similar risk characteristics with
other loans, where applicable, a separate estimate of ECL will be included in our total ACL on unfunded credit commitments. Loan commitments that are determined
to be unconditionally cancellable by the Company do not require an ACL on unfunded credit commitments.

Uncollectible Loans and Write-offs

Our charge-off policy applies to all loans, regardless of portfolio segment. Commercial loans are considered for a full or partial charge-off in the event that
principal or interest is over 180 days past due and the loan lacks sufficient collateral and it is not in the process of collection. Consumer loans are considered for a full
or partial charge-off in the event that principal or interest is over 120 days past due and the loan lacks sufficient collateral and it is not in the process of collection. We
also consider writing off loans in the event of any of the following circumstances: 1) the loan, or a portion of the loan is deemed uncollectible due to: a) the borrower's
inability to make recurring payments, b) material changes in the borrower's financial condition, or c) the expected sale of all or a portion of the borrower's business is
insufficient to repay the loan in full, or 2) the loan has been identified for charge-off by regulatory authorities.

Troubled Debt Restructurings

A TDR arises from the modification of a loan where we have granted a concession to the borrower related to the borrower's financial difficulties that we would
not have otherwise considered for economic or legal reasons. These concessions may include: (1) deferral of payment for more than an insignificant period of time
that does not include sufficient offsetting borrower concessions; (2) interest rate reductions; (3) extension of the maturity date outside of ordinary course extension;
(4) principal forgiveness; or (5) reduction of accrued interest.

We use the factors in ASC 310-40, Receivables, Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors, in analyzing when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, and
when we have granted a concession, both of which must be present for a restructuring to meet the criteria of a TDR. If we determine that a TDR exists, we measure
impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, except that as a practical expedient, we may also
measure impairment based on a loan's observable market price, or the fair value of the collateral less selling costs if the loan is a collateral-dependent loan.

In April 2020, we implemented three loan payment deferral programs targeted to assist borrowers who were the most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
These programs included relief for venture-backed, private bank and wine borrowers who met certain criteria. For loans modified under these programs, in
accordance with the provisions of Section 4013 of the CARES Act, we elected to not apply TDR classifications to borrowers who were current as of December 31, 2019.
In addition, for loans that did not meet the CARES Act criteria, we applied the guidance in an interagency statement issued by bank

109
Table of Contents
SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

regulatory agencies. Using this guidance, we may find that borrowers are not experiencing financial difficulty that may otherwise result in a TDR classification, in
accordance with ASC Subtopic 310-40, if loan modifications are performed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, provide short-term loan payment deferrals (e.g. six
months in duration) and are granted to borrowers who were current as of the implementation date of the loan modification program. We evaluated all loans modified
under these programs against the CARES Act and interagency guidance, as applicable, and determined the loan modifications would not be considered TDRs. We did
not defer interest income recognition during periods of payment deferral, nor did any qualifying modification trigger nonaccrual status.

Nonaccrual Loans

Loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when they become 90 days past due as to principal or interest payments (unless the principal and interest are
well secured and in the process of collection); or when we have determined, based upon currently known information, that the timely collection of principal or
interest is not probable.

When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, the accrued interest and fees are reversed against interest income and the loan is accounted for using the cost
recovery method thereafter until qualifying for return to accrual status. For a loan to be returned to accrual status, all delinquent principal and interest must become
current in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement and future collection of remaining principal and interest must be deemed probable. We apply a cost
recovery method in which all cash received is applied to the loan principal until it has been collected. Under this approach, interest income is recognized after total
cash flows received exceed the recorded investment at the date of initial nonaccrual. All of our nonaccrual loans have credit risk ratings of 8 or 9 and are classified
under the nonperforming category.

Purchased Credit-Deteriorated Loans

Loans acquired where there is evidence of more than insignificant credit deterioration since origination are classified as PCD. We consider various factors in
connection with this determination, including past due or nonaccrual status, credit risk rating declines, and any write downs recorded based on the collectability of the
asset, among other factors. PCD loans are recorded at their purchase price plus an ECL estimated at the time of acquisition, which represents the amortized cost basis
of the asset. The difference between this amortized cost basis and the par value of the loan is the non-credit discount or premium, which is amortized into interest
income over the life of the loan. Subsequent increases and decreases in the allowance for credit losses related to purchased loans is recorded as provision expense.

Premises and Equipment

Premises and equipment are reported at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-
line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or the terms of the related leases, whichever is shorter. The maximum estimated useful lives by asset
classification are as follows:

Leasehold improvements Lesser of lease term or asset life
Furniture and equipment 3-7 years
Computer software 3-7 years
Computer hardware 3-5 years
We capitalize the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use, including costs related to developed software, purchased software licenses
and certain implementation costs.

For property and equipment that is retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the
resulting gain or loss is included in noninterest expense in consolidated net income.

Lease Obligations

We have entered into leases for real estate and equipment. At the inception of the lease, each lease is evaluated to determine whether the lease will be
accounted for as an operating or finance lease. We had no finance lease obligations at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. We have made an accounting
policy election not to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities that arise from short-term leases for any class of underlying asset. In addition to excluding short-
term leases, we have implemented an accounting policy in which non-lease components are not separated from lease components in the measurement of ROU asset
and lease liabilities for all lease contracts.

ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from
the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As
most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in
determining the present value of lease payments. We use the implicit rate when readily determinable. The operating lease

110
Table of Contents
SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is
reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

The Company reviews ROU assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be
recoverable. ROU assets are reviewed for recoverability at the lowest level in which there are identifiable cash flows (<asset group=). The carrying amount of an asset
group is not considered recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. If the asset group is
determined not to be recoverable, then an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the store asset group exceeds its fair
value. The resulting impairment charge, if any, is allocated to the underlying assets on a pro rata basis using their relative carrying amounts.

Business Combinations

Business combinations are accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. Acquired assets, including separately identifiable intangible assets, and
assumed liabilities are recorded at their acquisition-date estimated fair values. The excess of the cost of acquisition over these fair values is recognized as goodwill.
During the measurement period, which cannot exceed one year from the acquisition date, changes to estimated fair values are recognized as an adjustment to
goodwill. Certain transaction costs are expensed as incurred.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill is not amortized and is subject, at a minimum, to an annual impairment assessment. A quantitative assessment will be completed if we have not
recently completed a fair value assessment of the associated reporting unit and compared the assessed fair value of that reporting unit with its carrying amount,
including goodwill. Should we be required to calculate the fair value of the reporting unit, we would generally apply a discounted cash flow analysis that uses
forecasted performance estimates, and a discount rate leveraging a reporting unit specific capital asset pricing model, which in turn uses assumptions related to
market performance and various macroeconomic and reporting unit specific risks. If this quantitative assessment was recently completed and if we deem the estimate
to be current and reliable, we will not perform a full quantitative assessment of the reporting unit9s fair value for that reporting period. Instead, we will qualitatively
determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. As part of this qualitative
analysis we consider macroeconomic factors that might impact the entity9s performance, entity-specific financial performance of the reporting unit, changes in
management or strategy and other factors. We will evaluate goodwill for impairment more frequently if circumstances indicate that the fair value of our reporting
units is less than their carrying value, including goodwill.

Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and all intangible assets are subject to impairment if events or circumstances
indicate that the fair value is less than the carrying amount.

Fair Value Measurements

Our AFS securities, derivative instruments and certain equity securities are financial instruments recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. We make estimates
regarding valuation of assets and liabilities measured at fair value in preparing our consolidated financial statements.

Fair Value Measurement-Definition and Hierarchy

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (the <exit price=) in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date. There is a three-level hierarchy for disclosure of assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. The classification of assets and
liabilities within the hierarchy is based on whether the inputs to the valuation methodology used for measurement are observable or unobservable and on the
significance of those inputs in the fair value measurement. Observable inputs reflect market-derived or market-based information obtained from independent
sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our estimates about market data and views of market participants. The three levels for measuring fair value are based on
the reliability of inputs and are as follows:

Level 1

Fair value measurements based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access. Since valuations are based
on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market, valuation of these instruments does not entail a significant degree of judgment. Assets
utilizing Level 1 inputs include U.S. Treasury securities, foreign government debt securities, exchange-traded equity securities and certain marketable securities
accounted for under fair value accounting.

111
Table of Contents
SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

Level 2

Fair value measurements based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, directly or indirectly. Valuations
for the AFS securities are provided by independent pricing service providers who have experience in valuing these securities and are compared to the average of
quoted market prices obtained from independent brokers. We perform a monthly analysis on the values received from third parties so that the prices represent a
reasonable estimate of the fair value. The procedures include, but are not limited to, initial and ongoing review of third-party pricing methodologies, review of pricing
trends and monitoring of trading volumes. Additional corroboration, such as obtaining a non-binding price from a broker, may be obtained depending on the
frequency of trades of the security and the level of liquidity or depth of the market. Prices received from independent brokers represent a reasonable estimate of the
fair value and are validated through the use of observable market inputs including comparable trades, yield curve, spreads and, when available, market indices. If we
determine that there is a more appropriate fair value based upon the available market data, the price received from the third party is adjusted accordingly. Below is a
summary of the significant inputs used for each class of Level 2 assets and liabilities:

U.S. agency debentures: Fair value measurements of U.S. agency debentures are based on the characteristics specific to bonds held, such as issuer name,
issuance date, coupon rate, maturity date and any applicable issuer call option features. Valuations are based on market spreads relative to similar term
benchmark market interest rates, generally U.S. Treasury securities.
Agency-issued MBS: Agency-issued MBS are pools of individual conventional mortgage loans underwritten to U.S. agency standards with similar coupon rates,
tenor, and other attributes such as geographic location, loan size and origination vintage. Fair value measurements of these securities are based on observable
price adjustments relative to benchmark market interest rates taking into consideration estimated loan prepayment speeds.
Agency-issued CMO: Agency-issued CMO are structured into classes or tranches with defined cash flow characteristics and are collateralized by U.S. agency-
issued mortgage pass-through securities. Fair value measurements of these securities incorporate similar characteristics of mortgage pass-through securities
such as coupon rate, tenor, geographic location, loan size and origination vintage, in addition to incorporating the effect of estimated prepayment speeds on the
cash flow structure of the class or tranche. These measurements incorporate observable market spreads over an estimated average life after considering the
inputs listed above.
Agency-issued CMBS: Fair value measurements of these securities are based on spreads to benchmark market interest rates (usually U.S. Treasury rates or rates
observable in the swaps market), prepayment speeds, loan default rate assumptions and loan loss severity assumptions on underlying loans.
Foreign exchange forward and option contract assets and liabilities: Fair value measurements of these assets and liabilities are priced based on spot and
forward foreign currency rates and option volatility assumptions.
Interest rate derivative and interest rate swap assets and liabilities: Fair value measurements of interest rate derivatives and interest rate swaps are priced
considering the coupon rate of the fixed leg of the contract and the variable coupon rate on the floating leg of the contract. Valuation is based on both spot and
forward rates on the swap yield curve and the credit worthiness of the contract counterparty.
Other equity securities: Fair value measurements of equity securities of public companies are priced based on quoted market prices less a discount if the
securities are subject to certain sales restrictions. Certain sales restriction discounts generally range from 10 percent to 20 percent depending on the duration of
the sale restrictions which typically range from three to six months.
Equity warrant assets (public portfolio): Fair value measurements of equity warrant assets of publicly-traded portfolio companies are valued based on the Black-
Scholes option pricing model. The model uses the price of publicly-traded companies (underlying stock price), stated strike prices, warrant expiration dates, the
risk-free interest rate and market-observable option volatility assumptions.
Level 3

The fair value measurement is derived from valuation techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market. These unobservable
assumptions reflect our own estimates of assumptions we believe market participants would use in pricing the asset. The valuation techniques are consistent with the
market approach, income approach or the cost approach used to measure fair value. Below is a summary of the valuation techniques used for each class of Level 3
assets:

Venture capital and private equity fund investments not measured at net asset value: Fair value measurements are based on consideration of a range of
factors including, but not limited to, the price at which the investment was acquired, the term and nature of the investment, local market conditions, values for
comparable securities, and as it
112

SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

relates to the private company, the current and projected operating performance, exit strategies and financing transactions subsequent to the acquisition of the
investment. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement include the information about each portfolio company, including actual and
forecasted results, cash position, recent or planned transactions and market comparable companies.
Equity warrant assets (public portfolio): Fair value measurements of equity warrant assets of publicly-traded portfolio companies are valued based on the Black-
Scholes option pricing model. The model uses the price of publicly-traded companies (underlying stock price), stated strike prices, warrant expiration dates, the
risk-free interest rate and market-observable option volatility assumptions. Modeled asset values are further adjusted by applying a discount of up to 20 percent
for certain warrants that have certain sales restrictions or other features that indicate a discount to fair value is warranted.
Equity warrant assets (private portfolio): Fair value measurements of equity warrant assets of private portfolio companies are priced based on a Black-Scholes
option pricing model to estimate the asset value by using stated strike prices, option expiration dates, risk-free interest rates and option volatility assumptions.
Option volatility assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model are based on public market indices whose members operate in similar industries as companies in
our private company portfolio. Option expiration dates are modified to account for estimates to actual life relative to stated expiration. Overall model asset
values are further adjusted for a general lack of liquidity due to the private nature of the associated underlying company. There is a direct correlation between
changes in the volatility and remaining life assumptions in isolation and the fair value measurement while there is an inverse correlation between changes in the
liquidity discount assumption and the fair value measurement.
Fee-based Services Revenue Recognition

Refer to Note 174<Noninterest Income= for our fee-based services revenue recognition policies for our contracts with customers.
Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax
credit carryforwards. Our federal, state and foreign income tax provisions are based upon taxes payable for the current year, current year changes in deferred taxes
related to temporary differences between the tax basis and financial statement balances of assets and liabilities, and a reserve for uncertain tax positions. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are included in the consolidated financial statements at currently enacted income tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax
assets and liabilities are expected to be realized. As changes in tax laws or rates are enacted, deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for
income taxes. A valuation allowance is provided, when it is determined based upon available evidence, that it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred
tax asset will not be realized. We file a consolidated federal income tax return, and consolidated, combined, or separate state income tax returns as appropriate. Our
foreign incorporated subsidiaries file tax returns in the applicable foreign jurisdictions. We record interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in other
noninterest expense, a component of consolidated net income.

Share-Based Compensation

Generally, for our stock-based awards granted, stock-based compensation expense is amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period,
including consideration of vesting conditions and anticipated forfeitures. The service period is reduced for a select number of awards that provide for continued
vesting upon retirement if any of the grantees are retirement eligible at the date of grant (or will become retirement eligible during the vesting period). The fair value
of stock options is measured using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and the fair value for restricted stock awards and restricted stock units are based on the
quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant.

Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per common share is computed using the weighted average number of common stock shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per
common share is computed using the weighted average number of common stock shares and potential common shares outstanding during the period. Potential
common shares consist of stock options, ESPP shares and restricted stock units. Common stock equivalent shares are excluded from the computation if the effect is
antidilutive.

Derivative Financial Instruments

All derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. The accounting for changes in fair value of a derivative financial instrument depends
on whether the derivative financial instrument is designated and qualifies as part of a

113
Table of Contents
SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

hedging relationship and, if so, the nature of the hedging activity. Changes in fair value are recognized through earnings for derivatives that do not qualify for hedge
accounting treatment, or that have not been designated in a hedging relationship.

Cash Flow Hedges

For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in AOCI and recognized
in earnings as the hedged item affects earnings. To qualify for hedge accounting, a derivative must be highly effective at reducing exposure to the hedged risk.
Derivative amounts affecting earnings are recognized consistent with the classification of the hedged item in the line item "loans" as part of interest income, a
component of consolidated net income. We assess hedge effectiveness on a quarterly basis to ensure all hedges remain highly effective to ensure hedge accounting
can be applied. If the hedging relationship no longer exists or no longer qualifies as a hedge, any amounts remaining as gain or loss in AOCI are reclassified into
earnings in the line item "loans" as part of interest income, a component of consolidated net income.

Fair value hedges

For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, both the changes in the fair value of the derivative and the portion of the fair
value adjustments associated with the portfolio attributable to the hedged risk will be recognized into earnings as they occur. To qualify for hedge accounting, a
derivative must be highly effective at reducing the hedged risk exposure. Derivative amounts affecting earnings are recognized consistent with the classification of the
hedged item in the line item "investment securities" as part of interest income, a component of consolidated net income. We assess hedge effectiveness on a
quarterly basis to ensure all hedges remain highly effective and hedge accounting can be applied. If the hedging relationship no longer exists or no longer qualifies as a
hedge, any remaining fair value basis adjustments are allocated to the individual assets in the portfolio and amortized into earnings over a period consistent with the
amortization of other discounts and premiums associated with the respective assets.

Equity Warrant Assets

In connection with negotiated credit facilities and certain other services, we may obtain equity warrant assets giving us the right to acquire stock in primarily
private, venture-backed companies in the technology and life science/healthcare industries. We hold these assets for prospective investment gains. We do not use
them to hedge any economic risks nor do we use other derivative instruments to hedge economic risks stemming from equity warrant assets.

In general, equity warrant assets entitle us to buy a specific number of shares of stock at a specific price within a specific time period. Certain equity warrant
assets contain contingent provisions, which adjust the underlying number of shares or purchase price upon the occurrence of specified future events. Substantially all
our warrant agreements qualify as derivatives and are reported at fair value as a component of other assets, on our consolidated balance sheet.

The grant date fair values of equity warrant assets received in connection with the issuance of a credit facility are deemed to be loan fees and recognized as an
adjustment of loan yield through loan interest income. Similar to other loan fees, the yield adjustment related to grant date fair value of warrants is recognized over
the life of that credit facility. Any changes in fair value after the grant date are recognized as net gains or losses on equity warrant assets, in noninterest income, a
component of consolidated net income.

We value our equity warrant assets using a Black-Scholes option pricing model, which incorporates the following significant inputs:
" An underlying asset value, which is estimated based on current information available in valuation reports, including any information regarding subsequent
rounds of funding or performance of a company.
" Stated strike price, which can be adjusted for certain warrants upon the occurrence of subsequent funding rounds or other future events.
" Price volatility or risk associated with possible changes in the warrant price. The volatility assumption is based on historical price volatility of publicly
traded companies within indices similar in nature to the underlying client companies issuing the warrant. The actual volatility input is based on the mean
and median volatility for an individual public company within an index for the past 16 quarters, from which an average volatility was derived.
" Actual data on terminations and exercises of our warrants are used as the basis for determining the expected remaining life of the warrants in each
financial reporting period. Warrants may be exercised in the event of acquisitions, mergers or IPOs, and cancelled due to events such as bankruptcies,
restructuring activities or additional financings. These events cause the expected remaining life assumption to be shorter than the contractual term of the
warrants.
" The risk-free interest rate is derived from the Treasury yield curve and is calculated based on a weighted average of the risk-free interest rates that
correspond closest to the expected remaining life of the warrant.
114

SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

" Other adjustments, including a marketability discount, are estimated based on management's judgment about the general industry environment.
" Number of shares and contingencies associated with obtaining warrant positions such as the funding of associated loans.
When a company in the portfolio completes an IPO, or is acquired, we may exercise these equity warrant assets for shares or cash. In the event of an exercise
for common stock shares, the basis or value in the common stock shares is reclassified from other assets to investment securities on the balance sheet on the latter of
the exercise date or corporate action date.

The common stock of public companies is classified as non-marketable and other equity securities. Changes in the fair value of the common stock is recorded as
gains or losses on investments securities, in noninterest income, a component of consolidated net income. We account for these securities without a readily
determinable fair value based on the price at which the investment was acquired plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly
transactions for identical or similar investments, with changes recorded as gains or losses on investment securities, in noninterest income, a component of
consolidated net income.

Foreign Exchange Forwards and Foreign Currency Option Contracts

We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign currency option contracts with clients involved in international activities, either as the purchaser
or seller, depending upon the clients' need. We also enter into an opposite-way forward or option contract with a correspondent bank to economically hedge client
contracts to mitigate the fair value risk to us from fluctuations in currency rates. Settlement, credit and operational risks remain. We also enter into forward contracts
with correspondent banks to economically hedge currency exposure risk related to certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. These contracts are not
designated as hedging instruments and are recorded at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets. The contracts generally have terms of one year or less, although
we may have contracts extending for up to five years. Generally, we have not experienced nonperformance on these contracts, have not incurred credit losses and
anticipate performance by all counterparties to such agreements. Changes in the fair value of these contracts are recognized in consolidated net income under other
noninterest income, a component of noninterest income. Period-end gross positive fair values are recorded in other assets and gross negative fair values are recorded
in other liabilities.

Interest Rate Contracts

We sell interest rate contracts to clients who wish to mitigate their interest rate exposure. We economically reduce the interest rate risk from this business by
entering into opposite-way contracts with correspondent banks. We do not designate any of these contracts (which are derivative instruments) as qualifying for hedge
accounting. Contracts in an asset position are included in other assets and contracts in a liability position are included in other liabilities. The net change in the fair
value of these derivatives is recorded through other noninterest income, in noninterest income, a component of consolidated net income.

Adoption of New Accounting Standards

Income Taxes

In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (ASU 2019-12), which is part of the
FASB9s initiative to reduce cost and complexity related to accounting for income taxes. ASU 2019-12 eliminates certain exceptions to the general principles of ASC 740,
Income Taxes, and simplifies income tax accounting in several areas. We adopted the guidance on January 1, 2021, on a modified retrospective basis. The adoption did
not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows or disclosures.

Summary of Allowance for Loan Losses, Allowance for Unfunded Credit Commitments and Impaired Loans Superseded by Recently Adopted Accounting Standards
(Applicable to the Year Ending December 31, 2019)

Allowance for Loan Losses

The allowance for loan losses considers credit risk and is established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense. Our allowance for loan losses is
established for estimated loan losses that are probable and incurred but not yet realized. Our evaluation process is designed to determine that the allowance for loan
losses is appropriate at the balance sheet date. The process of estimating loan losses is inherently imprecise.

We maintain a systematic process for the evaluation of individual loans and pools of loans for inherent risk of loan losses. At the time of approval, each loan in
our portfolio is assigned a Credit Risk Rating and industry niche. Credit Risk Ratings are assigned on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 representing loans with a low risk of
nonpayment, 9 representing loans with

115
Table of Contents
SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

the highest risk of nonpayment, and 10 representing loans which have been charged-off. The credit risk ratings for each loan are monitored and updated on an
ongoing basis. This Credit Risk Rating process includes, but is not limited to, consideration of such factors as payment status, the financial condition and operating
performance of the borrower, borrower compliance with loan covenants, underlying collateral values and performance trends, the degree of access to additional
capital, the presence of credit enhancements such as third party guarantees (where applicable), the degree to which the borrower is sensitive to external factors, the
depth and experience of the borrower's management team, potential loan concentrations, and general economic conditions. Our policies require a committee of
senior management to review, at least quarterly, credit relationships with a credit risk rating of 5 through 9 that exceed specific dollar values. Our review process
evaluates the appropriateness of the credit risk rating and allocation of the allowance for loan losses, as well as other account management functions. The allowance
for loan losses is determined based on a qualitative analysis and a formula allocation for similar risk-rated loans categorized by portfolio segment, and individually for
impaired loans. The formula allocation provides the average loan loss experience for each portfolio segment, which considers our quarterly historical loss experience
since the year 2000, both by risk-rating category and client industry sector. The resulting loan loss factors for each risk-rating category and client industry sector are
ultimately applied to the respective period-end client loan balances for each corresponding risk-rating category and client industry sector to provide an estimation of
the allowance for loan losses. The probable loan loss experience for any one year period of time is reasonably expected to be greater or less than the average as
determined by the loss factors. As such, management applies a qualitative allocation to the results of the aforementioned model to ascertain the total allowance for
loan losses. This qualitative allocation is based on management's assessment of the risks that may lead to a loan loss experience that is different from our historical
loan loss experience. Based on management's prediction or estimate of changing risks in the lending environment, the qualitative allocation may vary significantly
from period to period and includes, but is not limited to, consideration of the following factors:

" Changes in lending policies and procedures, including underwriting standards and collections, and charge-off and recovery practices;
" Changes in national and local economic business conditions, including the market and economic condition of our clients' industry sectors;
" Changes in the nature of our loan portfolio;
" Changes in experience, ability, and depth of lending management and staff;
" Changes in the trend of the volume and severity of past due and classified loans;
" Changes in the trend of the volume of nonaccrual loans, troubled debt restructurings and other loan modifications;
" Reserve floor for portfolio segments that would not draw a minimum reserve based on the lack of historical loan loss experience;
" Reserve for large funded loan exposure;
" Reserve for performing impaired loan exposure; and
" Other factors as determined by management from time to time.
While the evaluation process of our allowance for loan losses uses historical and other objective information, the classification of loans and the establishment of
the allowance for loan losses rely, to a great extent, on the judgment and experience of our management.

Allowance for Unfunded Credit Commitments

We record a liability for probable and estimable incurred losses associated with our unfunded credit commitments being funded and subsequently being
charged off. Each quarter, every unfunded client credit commitment is allocated to a credit risk-rating in accordance with each client's credit risk rating and portfolio
segment. We use the segment specific historical loan loss factors described above under "Allowance for Loan Losses" to calculate the loan loss experience if unfunded
credit commitments are funded. Separately, we use historical trends to calculate a probability of an unfunded credit commitment being funded. We apply the loan
funding probability factor to risk-factor adjusted unfunded credit commitments by credit risk-rating and portfolio segment to derive the allowance for unfunded credit
commitments, similar to funded loans. The allowance for unfunded credit commitments also includes certain qualitative allocations as deemed appropriate by
management. We include the allowance for unfunded credit commitments in other liabilities and the related provision in our provision for credit losses.

Impaired Loans

A loan is considered impaired when, based upon currently known information, it is deemed probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according
to the contractual terms of the agreement. On a quarterly basis, we review our loan portfolio for impairment. Within each class of loans, we review individual loans for
impairment based on credit risk ratings. Loans risk-rated 5 through 7 are performing loans; however, we consider them as demonstrating higher risk, which requires
more frequent review of individual exposures. Such loans translate to an internal rating of "Performing (Criticized)" and could be classified as a performing impaired
loan.

For each loan identified as impaired, we measure the impairment based upon the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective
interest rate. In limited circumstances, we may measure impairment based on the loan's observable market price or the fair value of the collateral less selling costs if
the loan is collateral dependent. Impaired collateral-dependent loans will have independent appraisals completed and accepted at least annually. The fair value of the
collateral will be determined by the most recent appraisal, as adjusted to reflect a reasonable marketing period for the sale of the asset(s) and an estimate of
reasonable selling expenses.

If it is determined that the value of an impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan, net of previous charge-offs and payments collected, we
recognize impairment through the allowance for loan losses as determined by our analysis.

Reclassifications

Certain prior period amounts primarily related to the adoption of the ASU 2016-13 Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit
Losses on Financial Instruments) ("ASU 2016-13" or "CECL") as mentioned above have been reclassified to conform to current period presentations.

3. Business Combination

Boston Private

On July 1, 2021, we acquired, by merger, 100 percent of the voting equity interests of Boston Private Financial Holdings, Inc., the parent company of Boston
Private Bank & Trust Company. The acquisition of Boston Private accelerates SVB9s private bank and wealth management offering, strengthening SVB9s overall
platform and ability to fully meet the financial needs of its clients. The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination and accordingly, the results of Boston
Private's operations have been included in the Company's consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.

We acquired Boston Private for $1.2 billion comprised of $2.10 in cash and 0.0228 shares of SVB common stock for each Boston Private share. For the
transaction, we issued approximately 1.9 million shares of SVB common stock and registered an additional 99,000 shares of SVB common stock issuable upon the
exercise, vesting or settlement of converted legacy Boston Private equity awards.

The following table summarizes the allocation of the purchase price to the net assets of Boston Private as of July 1, 2021:

are subject to amortization over their estimated useful lives. The goodwill recorded includes expected revenue-generating synergies driven by the broadening of our
product suite and strength of the combined platform, providing our teams with expanded capabilities, technology and scalability to meet the increasing needs of our
Private Bank clients. Goodwill amounts have been allocated to the SVB Private Bank reporting segment and will not be deductible for tax purposes.

Due to the various conversions of Boston Private systems since the date of acquisition, as well as other streamlining and continuing integration of Boston
Private's operating activities into those of the Company, reporting for revenue and net income of the former Boston Private operations for the period subsequent to
the acquisition is impracticable.

Supplementary pro forma financial information related to the acquisition is not included because the impact to the Company's consolidated statements of

MoffettNathanson LLC

On December 10, 2021, we acquired 100 percent of the voting equity interests of MoffettNathanson LLC, a New York-based independent sell-side research firm
known for its coverage of high-growth, disruptive companies in the Media, Communications and Technology sectors. The acquisition enables SVB9s investment
banking business, SVB Securities, to expand its research coverage to include companies in both the healthcare and technology industries. The acquisition was
accounted for as a business combination and accordingly, the results of MoffettNathanson LLC operations have been included in the Company's consolidated financial
statements from the date of acquisition.

Supplementary pro forma financial and purchase information related to the acquisition is not included because the impact to the Company's consolidated

EPS

Basic EPS is the amount of earnings available to each share of common stock outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted EPS is the amount of earnings
available to each share of common stock outstanding during the reporting period adjusted to include the effect of potentially dilutive common shares. Potentially
dilutive common shares include incremental shares issuable for stock option and restricted stock unit awards outstanding under our 2006 Equity Incentive Plan and
our ESPP. Potentially dilutive common shares are excluded from the computation of dilutive EPS in periods in which the effect would be antidilutive. The following is a

5. Share-Based Compensation

Share-based compensation expense was recorded net of estimated forfeitures for 2021, 2020 and 2019, such that expense was recorded only for those share-
based awards that are expected to vest. In 2021, 2020 and 2019, we recorded share-based compensation and related benefits as follows:

Year ended December 31,

Share-based compensation expense $ 136 $ 84 $ 67
Income tax benefit related to share-based compensation expense (35) (20) (16)
Capitalized compensation costs 1 1 2

Equity Incentive Plans

Our 2006 Equity Incentive Plan (the <2006 Incentive Plan=) was adopted in May 2006, and is amended from time to time. The 2006 Incentive Plan provides for
the grant of various types of incentive awards, of which the following have been granted: (i) stock options; (ii) restricted stock awards; (iii) restricted stock units
(subject to either time-and/or performance-based vesting); and (iv) other cash or stock settled equity awards. Eligible participants in the 2006 Incentive Plan include
directors, employees and consultants.

Subject to the provisions of Section 16 of the 2006 Incentive Plan, the maximum aggregate number of shares that may be awarded and sold thereunder is
12,028,505.

Restricted stock awards/units are counted against the available-for-issuance limits of the 2006 Incentive Plan as two shares for every one share awarded.
Further, if shares acquired under any such award are forfeited, repurchased by SVB Financial, used to satisfy the tax withholding obligations related to an award or
otherwise canceled and would otherwise return to the 2006 Incentive Plan, two times the number of such shares will return to the 2006 Incentive Plan and will again
become available for issuance.

Under the terms of the 2006 Incentive Plan, and subject to certain exceptions, awards granted under the plan are subject to a minimum of at least one year of
vesting. Generally in practice, restricted stock units vest annually over four years and require continued employment or other service through the vesting period.
Performance-based restricted stock awards/units granted to executives generally vest upon meeting certain performance-based objectives over a three year period
and, typically, additional time-based vesting follow the end of the performance period, and require continued employment or other service through the vesting date.
Stock options typically vest annually over four years, from the grant date based on continued employment or other service, and expire no later than seven years after
the grant date. A select number of awards granted to certain employees will continue to vest in accordance with the normal vesting schedule in the event that the
employee retires (upon meeting certain age and service criteria) at least six months after the grant date and prior to the end of the vesting period, subject to certain
conditions. For accounting purposes, the requisite service period for these awards is reduced on an individual basis, as necessary, to reflect the employee9s individual
retirement eligibility date.

The underlying BPFH shares of the legacy Boston Private stock options and restricted stock units were converted into shares of the Company in connection with
the Boston Private acquisition on July 1, 2021. Information in this footnote includes the converted legacy Boston Private awards unless otherwise indicated. Upon
acquisition, 28,724 options and 67,542 restricted stock units were assumed by the Company from legacy Boston Private plans. All awards assumed from the legacy
Boston Private plans will be settled under the respective legacy plans. No future awards will be made under these plans.

We maintain the 1999 ESPP under which participating employees may annually contribute up to 10 percent of their gross compensation (not to exceed $25,000)
to purchase shares of our common stock at 85 percent of its fair market value at either the beginning or end of each six-month offering period, whichever price is less.
To be eligible to participate in the ESPP, an employee must, among other requirements, be employed by the Company on both the date of offering and date of
purchase, and be employed customarily for at least 20 hours per week and at least five months per calendar year. We issued 110,886 shares and received $41 million
in cash under the ESPP in 2021. At December 31, 2021, a total of 1,059,586 shares of our common stock were still available for future issuance under the ESPP.

Unrecognized Compensation Expense

As of December 31, 2021, unrecognized share-based compensation expense was as follows:

Valuation Assumptions

The fair values of share-based awards for employee stock options and employee stock purchases made under our ESPP were estimated using the Black-Scholes
option pricing model. The fair values of restricted stock units were based on our closing stock price on the date of grant. The following weighted average assumptions
and fair values were used for our employee stock options and restricted stock units:

Equity Incentive Plan Awards 2021 2020 2019

Weighted average expected term of options - in years 4.7 4.6 4.6
Weighted average expected volatility of the Company's underlying common stock 43.5 % 41.9 % 35.5 %
Risk-free interest rate 0.85 0.37 2.26
Expected dividend yield 4 4 4
Weighted average grant date fair value - stock options $ 224.63 $ 66.44 $ 83.50
Weighted average grant date fair value - restricted stock units 554.32 199.51 243.65

The following weighted average assumptions and fair values were used for our ESPP:
ESPP 2021 2020 2019

Expected term in years 0.5 0.5 0.5
Weighted average expected volatility of the Company's underlying common stock 36.2 % 51.9 % 38.1 %
Risk-free interest rate 0.08 1.12 2.40
Expected dividend yield 4 4 4
Weighted average grant date fair value $ 108.83 $ 69.54 $ 52.90

The expected term is based on the implied term of the stock options using factors based on historical exercise behavior. The expected volatilities are based on a
blended rate consisting of our historic volatility and our expected volatility over a five-year term which is an indicator of expected volatility and future stock price
trends. For 2021, 2020 and 2019, expected volatilities for the ESPP were equal to the historical volatility for the previous six-month periods. The expected risk-free
interest rates were based on the yields of U.S. Treasury securities, as reported by the FRB of New York, with maturities equal to the expected terms of the employee
stock options.

of $6 million and $90 million is included in long term debt previously issued by Boston Private and assumed in the acquisition.

Non-marketable and other equity securities

Our non-marketable and other equity securities portfolio primarily represents investments in venture capital and private equity funds, SPD-SVB, debt funds,
private and public portfolio companies, including public equity securities held as a result of equity warrant assets exercised and investments in qualified affordable
housing projects. A majority of these investments are investments held by SVB Financial in third-party funds in which we do not have controlling or significant variable
interests. These investments represent our unconsolidated VIEs in the table above. Our non-marketable and other equity securities portfolio also includes investments
from SVB Capital. SVB Capital is the funds management business of SVB Financial Group, which focuses primarily on venture capital investments. The SVB Capital
family of funds is comprised of direct venture funds that invest in companies and funds of funds that invest in other venture capital funds. We have a controlling and
significant variable interest in three of these SVB Capital funds and consolidate these funds for financial reporting purposes.

All investments are generally non-redeemable and distributions are expected to be received through the liquidation of the underlying investments throughout
the life of the investment fund. Investments may only be sold or transferred subject to the notice and approval provisions of the underlying investment agreement.
Subject to applicable regulatory requirements, including the Volcker Rule, we also make commitments to invest in venture capital and private equity funds. For
additional details, see Note 214<Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Guarantees and Other Commitments.=

The Bank also has variable interests in low income housing tax credit funds, in connection with fulfilling its responsibilities under the CRA, that are designed to
generate a return primarily through the realization of federal tax credits. These investments are typically limited partnerships in which the general partner, other than
the Bank, holds the power over significant activities of the VIE; therefore, these investments are not consolidated. For additional information on our investments in
qualified affordable housing projects see Note 94<Investment Securities."

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

As of December 31, 2021, our exposure to loss with respect to the consolidated VIEs is limited to our net assets of $794 million and our exposure to loss for our
unconsolidated VIEs is equal to our investment in these assets of $1.2 billion.

Junior subordinated debentures

SVB Financial Group assumed two statutory trusts during the merger with Boston Private. These trusts were for the purpose of issuing trust preferred securities
and investing the proceeds in junior subordinated debentures. These statutory trusts created by legacy Boston Private are not consolidated within the financial
statements as the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the trusts; however, the total junior subordinated debentures payable to the preferred stockholders of
statutory trusts are reported as long-term debt in the financial statements. For additional information see Note 154<Short-Term Borrowings and Long-Term Debt."

7. Reserves on Deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank and Federal Bank Stock

As was announced on March 15, 2020, the Federal Reserve board reduced reserve requirement ratios to zero percent which effectively eliminated reserve
requirements for all depository institutions effective March 26, 2020. Prior to March 26, 2020, the Bank was required to maintain reserves against customer deposits
by keeping balances with the Federal Reserve. The cash balances at the Federal Reserve were classified as cash and cash equivalents. Additionally, as a member of the
FHLB and FRB, we are required to hold shares of FHLB and FRB stock under the Bank's borrowing agreement. FHLB and FRB stock are recorded at cost as a component
of other assets, and any cash dividends received are recorded as a component of other noninterest income.

The tables below provide information on the required reserve balances at the Federal Reserve, as well as shares held at the FHLB and FRB for the years ended
and as of December 31, 2021 and 2020:

period of time greater than 12 months. Based on our analysis of the securities in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2021, the decline in value is
unrelated to credit loss and is related to changes in market interest rates since purchase and therefore changes in value for securities are included in other
comprehensive income. Market valuations and credit loss analyses on assets in the AFS securities portfolio are reviewed and monitored on a quarterly basis. As of
December 31, 2021, we do not intend to sell any of our securities in an unrealized loss position prior to recovery of our amortized cost basis, and it is more likely
than not that we will not be required to sell any of our securities prior to recovery of our amortized cost basis. None of the investments in our AFS securities
portfolio were past due as of December 31, 2021.

for a period of time greater than 12 months. None of the investments in our AFS securities portfolio were past due as of December 31, 2020.
The following table summarizes the fixed income securities, carried at fair value, classified as AFS as of December 31, 2021 by the remaining contractual
principal maturities. For U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. agency debentures and foreign government debt securities, the expected maturity is the actual contractual
maturity of the notes. Expected maturities for MBS may differ significantly from their contractual maturities because mortgage borrowers have the right to prepay
outstanding loan obligations with or without penalties. MBS classified as AFS typically have original contractual maturities from 10 to 30 years whereas expected
average lives of these securities tend to be significantly shorter and vary based upon structure and prepayments in lower interest rate environments.

Held-to-Maturity Securities

During the year ended December 31, 2021, we re-designated certain securities from the classification of AFS to HTM. The securities re-designated consisted of
agency-issued CMO's, CMBS', MBS' and U.S. agency debentures with a total carrying value of $8.8 billion. At the time of re-designation the securities included
$132 million of pretax net unrealized losses in other comprehensive income and are being amortized over the life of the securities in a manner consistent with the
amortization of a premium or discount. Our decision to re-designate the securities was based on our ability and intent to hold these securities to maturity. Factors
used in assessing the ability to hold these securities to maturity were future liquidity needs and sources of funding. HTM securities are carried on the balance sheet at
amortized cost and the changes in the value of these securities, other than an ACL, are not reported on the financial statements.

The components of our HTM investment securities portfolio at December 31, 2021 and 2020 are as follows:

Allowance for Credit Losses for HTM Securities

For HTM securities, the year ended December 31, 2021 had a beginning ACL balance of less than $1 million, a provision for credit losses of $7 million and an
ending ACL balance of $7 million.

For the year ended December 31, 2020, the beginning ACL balance, the day one impact of adopting ASC 326, the provision for credit losses and the ending
balance of ACL for HTM securities, in each case, were all less than $1 million.

Credit Quality Indicators

On a quarterly basis, management monitors the credit quality for HTM securities through the use of standard credit ratings. The following table summarizes our

The following table summarizes the remaining contractual principal maturities on fixed income investment securities classified as HTM as of December 31, 2021.
For U.S. agency debentures, the expected maturity is the actual contractual maturity of the notes. Expected remaining maturities for certain U.S. agency debentures
may occur earlier than their contractual maturities because the note issuers have the right to call outstanding amounts ahead of their contractual maturity. Expected
maturities for MBS may differ significantly from their contractual maturities because mortgage borrowers have the right to prepay outstanding loan obligations with or
without penalties. MBS classified as HTM typically have original contractual maturities from 10 to 30 years whereas expected average lives of these securities tend to
be significantly shorter and vary based upon structure and prepayments in lower interest rate environments; however, we expect to collect substantially all of the
recorded investment on these securities.

(2) The carrying value represents investments in 150 and 162 funds (primarily venture capital funds) at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively,
where our ownership interest is typically less than 5% of the voting interests of each such fund and in which we do not have the ability to exercise significant
influence over the partnerships operating activities and financial policies. We carry our unconsolidated venture capital and private equity fund investments at
fair value based on the fund investments' net asset values per share as obtained from the general partners of the investments. For each fund investment, we
adjust the net asset value per share for differences between our measurement date and the date of the fund investment9s net asset value by using the most
recently available financial information from the investee general partner, for example September 30 for our December 31 consolidated financial statements,
adjusted for any contributions paid, distributions received from the investment, and significant fund transactions or market events during the reporting period.

(3) These investments include direct equity investments in private companies. The carrying value is based on the price at which the investment was acquired plus or
minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments. We consider a range of factors when adjusting
the fair value of these investments, including, but not limited to, the term and nature of the investment, local market conditions, values for comparable
securities, current and projected operating performance, exit strategies, financing transactions subsequent to the acquisition of the investment and a discount
for certain investments that have lock-up restrictions or other features that indicate a discount to fair value is warranted.

We serve a variety of commercial clients in the private equity/venture capital, technology, life science/healthcare, premium wine and commercial real estate
industries. Loans made to private equity/venture capital firm clients typically enable them to fund investments prior to their receipt of funds from capital calls and are
reported under the Global Fund Banking class of financing receivable below. Our technology clients generally tend to be in the industries of hardware (such as
semiconductors, communications, data, storage and electronics), software/internet (such as infrastructure software, applications, software services, digital content
and advertising technology) and climate technology and sustainability. Our life science/healthcare clients primarily tend to be in the industries of biopharma,
healthtech, medical devices, healthcare services and diagnostics and tools. Loans to our technology and life science/healthcare clients are reported under the Investor
Dependent, Cash Flow Dependent - SLBO and Innovation C&I classes of financing receivable below. We also make commercial and industrial loans, such as working
capital lines and term loans for equipment and fixed assets, to clients that are not in the technology and life science/healthcare industries, which are reported in the
Other C&I class of financing receivable below. Loans to the premium wine industry focus on vineyards and wineries that produce grapes and wines of high quality.
Commercial real estate loans are generally acquisition financing for commercial properties such as office buildings, retail properties, apartment buildings and
industrial/warehouse space. In addition to commercial loans, we make consumer loans through SVB Private Bank and provide real estate secured loans to eligible
employees through our EHOP.

We also provide community development loans made as part of our responsibilities under the CRA. These loans are included within <construction loans= below
and are primarily secured by real estate. Additionally, beginning in April 2020, we accepted applications under the PPP administered by the SBA under the CARES Act
and originated loans to qualified small businesses. Disbursement of PPP funds under the CARES Act originally expired on August 8, 2020, however, on December 27,
2020, the Economic Aid Act was enacted, which extended the application period for PPP loans up to March 31, 2021, and allowed for certain PPP borrowers to apply
for second draw loans. The disbursement phase of the PPP was further extended to June 30, 2021 pursuant to the PPP Extension Act of 2021.

Credit Quality Indicators

For each individual client, we establish an internal credit risk rating for that loan, which is used for assessing and monitoring credit risk as well as performance of
the loan and the overall portfolio. Our internal credit risk ratings are also used to summarize the risk of loss due to failure by an individual borrower to repay the loan.
For our internal credit risk ratings, each individual loan is given a risk rating of 1 through 10. Loans risk-rated 1 through 4 are performing loans and translate to an
internal rating of <Pass,= with loans risk-rated 1 being cash secured. Loans risk-rated 5 through 7 are performing loans; however, we consider them as demonstrating
higher risk, which requires more frequent review of the individual exposures; these translate to an internal rating of <Criticized.= All of our nonaccrual loans are risk-
rated 8 or 9 and are classified under the nonperforming category. Loans rated 10 are charged-off and are not included as part of our loan portfolio balance. We review
our credit quality indicators on a quarterly basis for performance and appropriateness of risk ratings as part of our evaluation process for our ACL for loans.

Allowance for Credit Losses: Loans

For the year ending December 31, 2021, the ACL for loans decreased by $26 million, driven primarily by net charge-offs, improved economic conditions within
our forecasted assumptions and enhancements made to our allowance model, which were partially offset by growth in our loan portfolio, both from the acquisition of
Boston Private and organic growth.

The Moody's Analytics December 2021 forecast was utilized in our quantitative model for the ACL as of December 31, 2021 for both SVB and Boston Private
loans. The forecast assumptions included an improvement in the unemployment rate and a strong forecasted gross domestic product growth rate, both of which were
a result of ongoing economic stabilization as the pandemic's impact begins to subside. We determined the forecast to be a reasonable view of the outlook for the
economy given the available information at current year end. To the extent we identified credit risk considerations that were not captured by the Moody's Analytics
December 2021 forecast, we addressed the risk through management's qualitative adjustments to our ACL.

The enhancements made to our reserving model were made in normal course, with the primary enhancements being the addition of two years of portfolio data,
more granular prepayment models and the re-selection of macroeconomic variables.

The following tables summarize the activity relating to our ACL for loans for 2021, 2020 and 2019 broken out by portfolio segment:

Charge-offs and defaults on previously restructured loans are evaluated to determine the impact to the ACL for loans, if any. The evaluation of these defaults
may impact the assumptions used in calculating the reserve on other TDRs and nonaccrual loans as well as management9s overall outlook of macroeconomic factors
that affect the reserve on the loan portfolio as a whole. After evaluating the charge-offs and defaults experienced on our TDRs we determined that no change to our
reserving methodology for TDRs was necessary to determine the ACL for loans as of December 31, 2021.

Allowance for Credit Losses: Unfunded Credit Commitments

We maintain a separate ACL for unfunded credit commitments that is determined using a methodology that is inherently similar to the methodology used for
calculating the ACL for loans. At December 31, 2021, our ACL estimates utilized the Moody's economic forecasts from December 2021 as described above. The ACL for
unfunded commitments increased by $50 million from the prior year, driven primarily by growth in our outstanding commitments and compositional changes in our
portfolio.

We have operating leases for our corporate offices and certain equipment utilized at those properties. We are obligated under a number of noncancelable
operating leases for premises and equipment that expire at various dates, through 2030, and in most instances, include options to renew or extend at market rates
and terms. Such leases may provide for periodic adjustments of rentals during the term of the lease based on changes in various economic indicators.

Company9s credit standing as of the effective date of ASC 842. Additionally, the total lease term and total lease payments were also considered in determining the
rate. Based on these considerations the Company identified credit terms available under its existing credit lines which represent a collateralized borrowing rate
that has varying credit terms that could be matched to total lease terms and total lease payments in ultimately determining the implied borrowing rate in each
lease contract.

Following the acquisition of Boston Private, we decided to exit various leased office locations during 2021 and market these spaces for sublease. When a
company plans to utilize an ROU asset for less than it was initially intended, ASC 842, Leases, requires an evaluation for impairment and disclosure in accordance with
ASC 360-10-45-2, Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. We have recognized $39 million of impairment charges related to these leased office locations during

Short-term Borrowings

We have certain facilities in place to enable us to access short-term borrowings on a secured and unsecured basis. Our secured facilities include collateral
pledged to the FHLB of San Francisco and the discount window at the FRB (using both fixed income securities and loans as collateral). Our unsecured facility consists of
our uncommitted federal funds lines. As of December 31, 2021, collateral pledged to the FHLB of San Francisco was comprised primarily of fixed income investment
securities and loans and had a carrying value of $7.3 billion, of which $6.3 billion was available to support additional borrowings. As of December 31, 2021, collateral
pledged to the discount window at the FRB was comprised of fixed income investment securities and had a carrying value of $0.8 billion, all of which was unused and
available to support additional borrowings. Our total unused and available borrowing capacity for our uncommitted federal funds lines totaled $2.2 billion at
December 31, 2021. Our total unused and available borrowing capacity under our master repurchase agreements with various financial institutions totaled $5.5 billion
at December 31, 2021.

Long-term Debt

3.50% Senior Notes

In January 2015, SVB Financial issued $350 million of 3.50% Senior Notes due in January 2025 ("3.50% Senior Notes"). We received net proceeds of
approximately $346 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and issuance costs. The balance of our 3.50% Senior Notes at December 31, 2021

Junior Subordinated Debentures

On July 1, 2021, SVB Financial Group assumed two statutory trusts during the merger with Boston Private. These trusts were formed for the purpose of issuing
trust preferred securities and investing the proceeds in junior subordinated debentures. These statutory trusts created by legacy Boston Private are not consolidated
within the financial statements, however the total junior subordinated debentures payable to the preferred stockholders of statutory trusts are reported as long-term
debt in the financial statements.

The preferred securities represent an undivided beneficial interest in the assets of the trusts. We own all of the trusts' common securities. The trusts' only assets
are the junior subordinated debentures issued to it by Boston Private on substantially the same payment terms as the trusts' preferred securities.

Boston Private Capital Trust II Junior Subordinated Debentures ("Trust II")

As of December 31, 2021 there are $100 million of trust preferred securities outstanding. The preferred trust securities issued by Trust II pay interest quarterly
based on a floating three-month rate of LIBOR plus 1.68% which are cumulative. So long as the Company is not in default in the payment of interest on the junior
subordinated debentures, the Company has the right under the indenture to defer payments of interest for up to 20 consecutive quarterly periods. The Company does
not currently intend to exercise its right to defer interest payments on the junior debentures issued to Trust II. If the Company defers interest payments, it would be
subject to certain restrictions relating to the payment of dividends on or purchases of its capital stock and payments on its debt securities ranking equal with or junior
to the junior subordinated debentures. The effective interest rate on the junior subordinated debentures was 1.898%. The junior subordinated debentures will mature
on December 30, 2035. As of December 31, 2021, the carrying value of the Company's investment in Trust II was $3 million, which represents the total amount of
common securities in such trust.

Boston Private Capital Trust I Junior Subordinated Debenture ("Trust I")

As of December 31, 2021 there are less than $1 million of the convertible trust preferred securities outstanding. The convertible trust preferred securities issued
by Trust I pay interest quarterly and have a fixed distribution rate of 4.875%. The quarterly distributions are cumulative. The effective interest rate for the junior
subordinated debentures was 4.875%. The junior subordinated convertible debentures will mature on October 1, 2034. As of December 31, 2021, the carrying value of
the Company's investment in Trust I was $3 million, which represents the total amount of common securities in such trust.

16. Derivative Financial Instruments

We primarily use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk and currency exchange rate risk and to assist customers with their risk
management objectives, which may include currency exchange rate risks and interest rate risks. Also, in connection with negotiating credit facilities and certain other
services, we often obtain equity warrant assets giving us the right to acquire stock in private, venture-backed companies in the technology and life science/healthcare
industries.

Interest Rate Risk

Interest rate risk is our primary market risk and can result from timing and volume differences in the repricing of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities
and changes in market interest rates. To manage interest rate risk on our interest

th th
149
Table of Contents
SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

rate sensitive assets, we have entered into interest rate swap contracts to hedge against future changes in interest rates. We designate these interest rate swap
contracts as fair value and cash flow hedges.

Fair Value Hedges

To manage interest rate risk on our AFS securities portfolio, we enter into pay-fixed, receive-floating interest rate swap contracts to hedge against exposure to
changes in the fair value of the securities resulting from changes in interest rates. We designate these interest rate swap contracts as fair value hedges that qualify for
hedge accounting under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging ("ASC 815") and have elected to account for a portion of them using the last-of-layer method as outlined in
ASC 815. We record the fair value hedges in other assets and other liabilities. For qualifying fair value hedges, both the changes in the fair value of the derivative and
the portion of the fair value adjustments associated with the last-of-layer attributable to the hedged risk will be recognized into earnings as they occur. Derivative
amounts affecting earnings are recognized consistent with the classification of the hedged item in the line item "investment securities" as part of interest income, a
component of consolidated net income.

We assess hedge effectiveness under ASC 815 on a quarterly basis to ensure all hedges remain highly effective and hedge accounting under ASC 815 can be
applied. In conjunction with the assessment of effectiveness, we assess the hedged item to ensure it is expected to be outstanding at the hedged item9s assumed
maturity date and the last-of-layer method of accounting under ASC 815 can be applied. If the hedging relationship no longer exists or no longer qualifies as a hedge
per ASC 815, any remaining fair value basis adjustments are allocated to the individual assets in the portfolio and amortized into earnings over a period consistent with
the amortization of other discounts and premiums associated with the respective assets. As allowed under GAAP, we applied the "shortcut" method of accounting to a
portion of our fair value hedges which assumes there is perfect effectiveness.

The following table summarizes the amortized cost basis of hedged assets that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges and the cumulative amount of fair
value hedging adjustments included in the carrying value that have been recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2021:

December 31, 2021

AFS securities (1) $ 15,260 $ (125)

(1) These amounts include the amortized cost basis of closed portfolios used to designate hedging relationships in which the hedged item is the last layer expected to be
remaining at the end of the hedging relationship. At December 31, 2021, the amortized cost basis of the closed portfolios used in these hedging relationships was $11.2
billion, the amounts of the designated hedged items was $6.7 billion and the cumulative basis adjustments associated with these hedging relationships was $83 million.
(2) The balance includes $6 million of hedging adjustments on discontinued hedging relationships at December 31, 2021.

Cash Flow Hedges

To manage interest rate risk on our variable-interest rate loan portfolio, we enter into interest rate swap contracts to hedge against future changes in interest
rates by using hedging instruments to lock in future cash inflows that would otherwise be impacted by movements in the market interest rates. We designate these
interest rate swap contracts as cash flow hedges that qualify for hedge accounting under ASC 815 and record them in other assets and other liabilities. For qualifying
cash flow hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in AOCI and recognized in earnings as the hedged item affects earnings. Derivative amounts
affecting earnings are recognized consistent with the classification of the hedged item in the line item "loans" as part of interest income, a component of consolidated
net income.

We assess hedge effectiveness under ASC 815 on a quarterly basis to ensure all hedges remain highly effective to ensure hedge accounting under ASC 815 can be
applied. If the hedging relationship no longer exists or no longer qualifies as a hedge per ASC 815, any amounts remaining as gain or loss in AOCI are reclassified into
earnings in the line item "loans" as part of interest income, a component of consolidated net income. As of March 31, 2020, all derivatives previously classified as
hedges with notional balances totaling $5.0 billion and a net asset fair value of $228 million were terminated. As of December 31, 2021, the total unrealized gains on
terminated cash flow hedges remaining in AOCI is $116 million, or $83 million net of tax. The unrealized gains will be reclassified into interest income as the underlying
forecasted transactions impact earnings through the original maturity of the hedged forecasted transactions. The total remaining term over which the unrealized gains
will be reclassified into earnings is approximately three years.

Currency Exchange Risk

Table of Contents
SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to economically reduce our foreign exchange exposure risk associated with the net difference between
foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. We do not designate any foreign exchange forward contracts as derivative instruments that qualify for hedge
accounting. Gains or losses from changes in currency rates on foreign currency denominated instruments are recorded in the line item "other" as part of noninterest
income, a component of consolidated net income. We may experience ineffectiveness in the economic hedging relationship, because the instruments are revalued
based upon changes in the currency9s spot rate on the principal value, while the forwards are revalued on a discounted cash flow basis. We record forward
agreements in gain positions in other assets and loss positions in other liabilities, while net changes in fair value are recorded in the line item "other" as part of
noninterest income, a component of consolidated net income.

Other Derivative Instruments

Also included in our derivative instruments are equity warrant assets and client forward and option contracts, and client interest rate contracts. For further
description of these other derivative instruments, refer to Note 24<Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.=

Counterparty Credit Risk

We are exposed to credit risk if counterparties to our derivative contracts do not perform as expected. We mitigate counterparty credit risk through credit
approvals, limits, monitoring procedures and obtaining collateral, as appropriate. With respect to measuring counterparty credit risk for derivative instruments, we
measure the fair value of a group of financial assets and financial liabilities on a net risk basis by counterparty portfolio.

The total notional or contractual amounts and fair value of our derivative financial instruments at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 were as follows:

Gains on investment securities, net

Net gains on investment securities include both gains and losses from our non-marketable and other equity securities, which include public equity securities as a
result of exercised equity warrant assets, gains and losses from sales of our AFS debt securities portfolio, when applicable, and carried interest.

Our non-marketable and other equity securities portfolio primarily represents investments in venture capital and private equity funds, our China Joint Venture,
debt and credit funds, private and public portfolio companies, which include public equity securities held as a result of exercised equity warrant assets and qualified
affordable housing projects. We experience variability in the performance of our non-marketable and other equity securities from period to period, which results in
net gains or losses on investment securities (both realized and unrealized). This variability is due to a number of factors, including unrealized changes in the values of
our investments, changes in the amount of realized gains from distributions, changes in liquidity events and general economic and market conditions. Unrealized gains
from non-marketable and other equity securities for any single period are typically driven by valuation changes.

The extent to which any unrealized gains or losses will become realized is subject to a variety of factors, including, among other things, the expiration of certain
sales restrictions to which these equity securities may be subject to (e.g., lock-up agreements), changes in prevailing market prices, market conditions, the actual sales
or distributions of securities, and the timing of such actual sales or distributions, which, to the extent such securities are managed by our managed funds, are subject
to our funds' separate discretionary sales/distributions and governance processes.

Carried interest is comprised of preferential allocations of profits recognizable when the return on assets of our individual managed fund of funds and direct
venture funds exceeds certain performance targets and is payable to us, as the general partners of the managed funds. The carried interest we earn is often shared
with employees, who are also members of the general partner entities. We record carried interest on a quarterly basis by measuring fund performance to date versus
the performance target. For our unconsolidated managed funds, carried interest is recorded as gains on investment securities, net. For our consolidated managed
funds, it is recorded as a component of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. Carried interest allocated to others is recorded as a component of net
income attributable to noncontrolling interests. Any carried interest paid to us (or our employees) may be subject to reversal to the extent fund performance declines
to a level where inception to date carried interest is lower than actual payments made by the funds. The limited partnership agreements for our funds provide that
carried interest is generally not paid to the general partners until the funds have provided a full return of contributed capital to the limited partners. Accrued, but
unpaid carried interest may be subject to reversal to the extent that the fund performance declines to a level where inception-to-date carried interest is less than prior
amounts recognized. Carried interest income is accounted for under an ownership model based on ASC 323 4 Equity Method of Accounting and ASC 810 4
Consolidation.

Our AFS securities portfolio is a fixed income investment portfolio that is managed with the objective of earning an appropriate portfolio yield over the long-
term while maintaining sufficient liquidity and credit diversification as well as addressing our asset/liability management objectives. Though infrequent, sales of debt
securities in our AFS securities portfolio may result in net gains or losses and are conducted pursuant to the guidelines of our investment policy related to the
management of our liquidity position and interest rate risk.

Gains on investment securities are recognized outside of the scope of ASC 606 as it explicitly excludes noninterest income earned from our investment-related
activities. A summary of gains and losses on investment securities for 2021, 2020 and 2019 is as follows:

Year ended December 31,
(Dollars in millions) 2021 2020 2019

Gains on non-marketable and other equity securities, net $ 730 $ 360 $ 139
Gains (losses) on sales of AFS debt securities, net 31 61 (4)

Total gains on investment securities, net $^761 $^421 $^135

Gains on equity warrant assets, net

In connection with negotiating credit facilities and certain other services, we often obtain rights to acquire stock in the form of equity warrant assets in primarily
private, venture-backed companies in the technology and life science/healthcare industries. Any changes in fair value from the grant date fair value of equity warrant
assets will be recognized as increases or decreases to other assets on our balance sheet and as net gains or losses on equity warrant assets, in noninterest income, a
component of consolidated net income.

Client investment fees

Client investment fees include fees earned from discretionary investment management services for substantially all clients, managing clients9 portfolios based
on their investment policies, strategies and objectives and investment advisory fees. Revenue is recognized on a monthly basis upon completion of our performance
obligation and consideration is typically received in the subsequent month. Included in our sweep money market fees are Rule 12(b)-1 fees, revenue sharing and
customer transactional-based fees. Rule 12(b)-1 fees and revenue sharing are recognized as earned based on client funds that are invested in the period, typically
monthly. Transactional based fees are earned and recognized on fixed income securities when the transaction is executed on the clients' behalf. Amounts paid to
third-party service providers are predominantly expensed, such that client investment fees are recorded gross of payments made to third parties. A summary of client
investment fees by instrument type for 2021, 2020 and 2019 is as follows:

Wealth management and trust fees

Wealth management and trust fees was a new core fee income line item in the third quarter of 2021 reflective of the acquisition of Boston Private. These fees
are earned for providing wealth management, retirement plan advisory, family office, financial planning, trust services and other financial advisory services to clients.
The Company9s performance obligation under these contracts is satisfied over time as the services are provided. Fees are recognized monthly based on the average
monthly, beginning-of-quarter, or, for a small number of clients, end-of-quarter market value of the Private Bank AUM and the applicable fee rate, depending on the
terms of the contracts. Fees are also recognized monthly based either on a fixed fee amount or are based on the quarter-end (in arrears) market value of the Private
Bank AUM and the applicable fee rate, depending on the terms of the contracts. No performance-based incentives are earned under wealth management contracts.
Receivables are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in the "Accrued interest receivable and other assets" line item.

Trust fees are earned when the Company is appointed as trustee for clients. As trustee, the Company administers the client9s trust and manages the assets of the
trust, including investments and property. The Company9s performance obligation under these agreements is satisfied over time as the administration and
management services are provided. Fees are recognized monthly or, in certain circumstances, quarterly based on a percentage of the market value of the account as
outlined in the agreement. Payment frequency is defined in the individual contracts, which primarily stipulate that payment be monthly in arrears. No performance-
based incentives are earned on trust fee contracts. Receivables are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in the "Accrued interest receivable and other assets"
line item. A summary of wealth management and trust fees for 2021, 2020 and 2019 is as follows:

Foreign exchange fees

Foreign exchange fees represent the income differential between purchases and sales of foreign currency on behalf of our clients, primarily from spot contracts.
Foreign exchange spot contract fees are recognized upon the completion of the single performance obligation, the execution of a spot trade in exchange for a fee. In
line with customary business practice, the legal right transfers to the client upon execution of a foreign exchange contract on the trade date, and as such, we currently
recognize our fees based on the trade date and the transactions are typically settled within two business days.

Forward contract and option premium fees are recognized outside of the scope of ASC 606 as it explicitly excludes noninterest income earned from our
derivative-related activities. A summary of foreign exchange fee income by instrument type for 2021, 2020 and 2019 is as follows:

Year ended December 31,

earned after satisfying our performance obligation of providing nightly settlement services to a payment network. Costs related to rewards programs are recorded
when the rewards are earned by the customer and presented as a reduction to interchange fee income. Rewards programs continue to be accounted for under ASC
310 - Receivables. Our performance obligations for merchant service fees are to transmit data and funds between the merchant and the payment network. Credit card
interchange and merchant service fees are earned daily upon completion of transaction settlement services.

Annual card service fees are recognized on a straight-line basis over a 12-month period and continue to be accounted for under ASC 310 - Receivables. A

certain specified future events have occurred. Fees generated from letters of credit and standby letters of credit are deferred as a component of other liabilities and
recognized in noninterest income over the commitment period using the straight-line method, based on the likelihood that the commitment being drawn down will be
remote. Letters of credit and standby letters of credit fees are recognized outside of the scope of ASC 606 as it explicitly excludes noninterest income earned from our
lending related activities.

Investment banking revenue

We earn investment banking revenue from clients for providing services related to securities underwriting, private placements and advisory services on strategic
matters such as mergers and acquisitions. Underwriting fees are attributable to public and private offerings of equity and debt securities and are recognized at the
point in time when the offering has been deemed to be completed by the lead manager of the underwriting group. Once the offering is completed, the performance
obligation has been satisfied; we recognize the applicable management fee as well as the underwriting fee, net of consideration payable to customers. Private
placement fees are recognized at the point in time when the private placement is completed, which is generally when the client accepts capital from the fund raise.
Advisory fees from mergers and acquisitions engagements are generally recognized at the point in time when the related transaction is completed. Expenses are
deferred only to the extent they are explicitly reimbursable by the client and the related revenue is recognized at a point in time. All other deal-related expenses are
expensed as incurred. We have determined that we act as principal in the majority of these transactions and therefore present expenses gross within other operating
expenses.

A summary of investment banking revenue by instrument type for 2021, 2020 and 2019 is as follows:
Year ended December 31,
(Dollars in millions) 2021 2020 2019

Commissions

Commissions include commissions received from clients for the execution of agency-based brokerage transactions in listed and over-the-counter equities. The
execution of each trade order represents a distinct performance obligation and the transaction price is fixed at the point in time or trade order execution. Trade
execution is satisfied at the point in time that the customer has control of the asset and as such, fees are recorded on a trade date basis. The Company also earns
subscription fees for market intelligence services that are recognized over the period in which they are delivered. Fees received before the subscription period ends is
initially recorded as deferred revenue (a contract liability) in other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. Commissions are presented in the "Disaggregation of
revenue from contracts with customers" table below.

Other

Other noninterest income primarily includes income from fund management fees, gains from conversion of convertible debt options and service revenue. Fund
management fees are comprised of fees charged directly to our managed funds of funds and direct venture funds. Fund management fees are based upon the
contractual terms of the limited partnership agreements and are generally recognized as earned over the specified contract period, which is generally equal to the life
of the individual fund. Fund management fees are calculated as a percentage of committed capital and collected in advance and are received quarterly. Fund
management fees for certain of our limited partnership agreements are calculated as a percentage of distributions made by the funds and revenue is recorded only at
the time of a distribution event. As distribution events are not predetermined for these certain funds, management fees are considered variable and constrained
under ASC 606.

Gains from conversion of convertible debt options represent unrealized valuation gains on loan conversion derivative assets, and realized gains from the
conversion of debt instruments, convertible into a third party9s common stock upon a triggering event such as an IPO. Gains from conversion of convertible debt
options are recognized outside of the scope of ASC 606 as it explicitly excludes noninterest income earned from our derivative-related activities.

Other service revenue primarily consists of dividend income on FHLB/FRB stock, correspondent bank rebate income, incentive fees related to carried interest
and other fee income. We recognize revenue when our performance obligations are met and record revenues on a daily/monthly, quarterly, semi-annual or annual
basis. For event driven revenue sources, we recognize revenue when: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) we have performed the service, provided
we have no other remaining obligations to the customer, (iii) the fee is fixed or determinable and (iv) collectability is probable.

Net Deferred Tax Assets

U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards totaled $1 million and $2 million for December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Our foreign net operating loss
carryforwards totaled $25 million and $25 million at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. These net operating loss carryforwards expire at
various dates beginning in 2022.

Currently, we believe that it is more likely than not that the benefit from the foreign net operating loss carryforwards, which are associated with our Germany
and Canada operations, will not be realized in the near term due to uncertainties in the timing of future profitability in the course of business. In recognition of this, we
have a valuation allowance of $7 million on the deferred tax assets related to our German and Canadian net operating loss carryforwards as of December 31, 2021. We
believe it is more likely than not that the remaining deferred tax assets will be realized against future taxable income. Therefore, no valuation allowance was provided
for the remaining deferred tax assets.

We are subject to income tax and non-income based taxes by the U.S. federal tax authorities as well as various state and foreign tax authorities. The U.S. federal
government and the state of California are major tax filing jurisdictions. We are subject to examination by the IRS and tax authorities in various state, local and foreign
tax jurisdictions. The state of California

is currently examining the years 2013-2016. Our U.S. federal tax returns remain open to examination for 2018 and subsequent tax years. California tax returns remain
open to examination for 2017 and subsequent tax years.

At December 31, 2021, our unrecognized tax benefit was $37 million, the recognition of which would reduce our income tax expense by $30 million. We are
unable to estimate the unrecognized tax benefit that will materially change in the next 12 months.

We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters as part of income before income taxes. Interest and penalties were not material for the years
ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.

Incentive Compensation Plan

Our ICP is an annual cash incentive plan that rewards performance based on our financial results and other performance criteria. Awards are made based on
company performance, the employee's target bonus level and management's assessment of individual employee performance.

Direct Drive Incentive Compensation Plan

The Direct Drive Incentive Compensation Plan (<Direct Drive=) is an annual sales cash incentive program. Awards are based on sales teams' performance as to
predetermined financial targets and other company/individual performance criteria. Actual awards for each sales team member under Direct Drive are based on:
(i) the actual results and financial performance with respect to the incentive gross profit targets; (ii) the sales team payout targets; and (iii) the sales team member's
sales position and team payout allocation.

Warrant Incentive Plan

The Warrant Incentive Plan provides individual and team awards to those employees who negotiate warrants on our behalf. Designated participants, as
determined by the Company, share in the cash proceeds received by the Company from the exercise of equity warrant assets.

Deferred Compensation Plan

Under the Deferred Compensation Plan (the <DC Plan=), eligible employees may elect to defer up to 50 percent of their base salary and/or up to 100 percent of
any eligible bonus payment earned during the plan year. Any amounts deferred under the DC Plan will be invested and administered by us (or such person we
designate). We generally do not match employee deferrals to the DC Plan. From time to time, we may also offer deferred special retention incentives and employer
contributions under this plan to key plan participants. The deferred incentives and employer contributions are eligible for investment in the DC Plan during the
retention qualifying period or vesting period.

Voluntary deferrals under the DC Plan were $8 million, $6 million and $7 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The DC Plan overall, had investment gains
of $7 million, gains of $8 million and losses of $7 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

401(k) and ESOP

The 401(k) Plan and ESOP, collectively referred to as the <Plan=, is a combined 401(k) tax-deferred savings plan and employee stock ownership plan in which
most regular U.S. employees are eligible to participate.

Employees participating in the 401(k) Plan are allowed to contribute up to 75 percent of their pre-tax pay as defined in the Plan, up to the maximum annual
amount allowable under federal income tax regulations of $20,500 for December 31, 2021, $19,500 for 2020, and $19,000 for 2019. We match the employee's
contributions dollar-for-dollar, up to five percent of the employee's pre-tax pay as defined in the Plan. Our matching contributions vest immediately. The amount of
salary deferred, up to the allowed maximum, is not subject to federal or state income taxes at the time of deferral.

Discretionary ESOP and profit-sharing contributions, based on our company performance, are made by us to all eligible individuals employed by us on the last
day of the fiscal year. We may elect to contribute cash or our common stock (or a combination of cash and stock), in an amount not exceeding ten percent of the
employee's eligible pay earned in the fiscal year. The ESOP and/or profit-sharing contributions vest in equal annual increments over a participant's first five years of

164

SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

service (thereafter, all subsequent ESOP and/or profit-sharing contributions are fully vested). For 2021, 2020 and 2019, 6,100, 12,094 and 14,442 shares, respectively,
were allocated to participants in the ESOP.

SVB Securities Incentive Compensation Plan

Our SVB Securities Incentive Compensation Plan is an annual cash incentive plan that rewards performance of SVB Securities employees based on SVB Securities'
financial results. This plan requires employees who exceed certain compensation levels to defer a portion of their compensation, of which, 25% will be settled in the
form of restricted stock units and 75% will be settled in the form of cash. The deferred compensation vests over a period of up to five years.

SVB Securities Retention Award

The SVB Securities Retention Award is an incentive award that granted designated SVB Securities employees restricted stock awards and cash after the close of
the acquisition of SVB Securities in January 2019. The aggregate amount of the awards was $60 million, of which 50% will be settled in the form of cash and 50% in the
form of restricted stock awards. The awards vest in equal annual increments over five years.

EHOP Program

The EHOP is a benefit plan that provides for the issuance of mortgage loans to eligible employees. Eligible employees may apply for either an adjustable rate
mortgage (ARM) or a fixed rate loan for their primary residence. The ARM is a 30 year loan and has an initial fixed interest rate for five, seven or ten years after which
a floating rate will be set annually. The fixed rate loan program offers a 15 or 30 years loan and the interest rate is fixed for the life of the loan. Applicants must qualify
for a loan through the normal mortgage review and approval process, which is typical of industry standards. The maximum loan amount generally cannot be greater
than 85 percent of the lesser of the purchase price or the appraised value. The interest rate on the fixed-rate loan is written at SVB Private Bank client mortgage rates
and determined at SVB's discretion. Floating rates applied at the end of the fixed-rate period will be reset annually at 12 month LIBOR plus two and one quarter
percent. For additional details, see Note 104<Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses: Loans and Unfunded Credit Commitments.''

20. Related Parties

We have no material related party transactions requiring disclosure. In the ordinary course of business, the Bank may extend credit to related parties, including
executive officers, directors, principal shareholders and their related interests. Additionally, we also provide real estate secured loans to eligible employees through
our EHOP. For additional details, see Note 194<Employee Compensation and Benefit Plans.=

21. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Guarantees and Other Commitments

In the normal course of business, we use financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk to meet the financing needs of our customers. These financial
instruments include commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit and commitments to invest in venture capital and private equity fund investments. These
instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk. Credit risk is defined as the possibility of sustaining a loss because other parties to the financial
instrument fail to perform in accordance with the terms of the contract.

Commitments to Extend Credit

A commitment to extend credit is a formal agreement to lend funds to a client as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the agreement.
Such commitments generally have fixed expiration dates, or other termination clauses, and usually require a fee paid by the client upon us issuing the commitment.
The following table summarizes information related to our commitments to extend credit at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively:

December 31,
(Dollars in millions) 2021 2020
Loan commitments (1) $ 40,327 $ 28,975
Standby letters of credit (2) 3,612 3,003
Commercial letters of credit (3) 77 4

Total unfunded credit commitments $ 44,016 $ 31,982

Allowance for unfunded credit commitments (4) 171 121

(1) Represents commitments which are available for funding, due to clients meeting all collateral, compliance and financial covenants required under loan
commitment agreements.
(2) See below for additional information on guarantees under our standby letters of credit.

165
Table of Contents
SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

(3) Commercial letters of credit are issued primarily for inventory purchases by a client and are typically short-term in nature.
(4) Our allowance for credit losses for unfunded credit commitments includes an allowance for both our unfunded loan commitments and our letters of credit.

Our potential exposure to credit loss for commitments to extend credit, in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument, is the
contractual amount of the available unused loan commitment. We use the same credit approval and monitoring process in extending credit commitments as we do in
making loans. The actual liquidity needs and the credit risk that we have experienced have historically been lower than the contractual amount of commitments to
extend credit because a significant portion of these commitments expire without being drawn upon. We evaluate each potential borrower and the necessary collateral
on an individual basis. The type of collateral varies, but may include real property, intellectual property, bank deposits or business and personal assets. The credit risk
associated with these commitments is considered in the allowance for unfunded credit commitments.

Standby Letters of Credit

Standby letters of credit represent conditional commitments issued by us on behalf of a client to guarantee the performance of the client to a third party when
certain specified future events have occurred. We provide two types of standby letters of credit: performance and financial standby letters of credit. Performance
standby letters of credit are issued to guarantee the performance of a client to a third party when certain specified future events have occurred and are primarily used
to support performance instruments such as bid bonds, performance bonds, lease obligations, repayment of loans and past due notices. Financial standby letters of
credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the payment by a client to a third party (beneficiary) and are primarily used to support many types of
domestic and international payments. These standby letters of credit have fixed expiration dates and generally require a fee to be paid by the client at the time we
issue the commitment.

The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved with extending credit commitments to clients, and accordingly, we use
a credit evaluation process and collateral requirements similar to those for credit commitments. When necessary, our standby letters of credit often are cash secured
by our clients. The actual liquidity needs and the credit risk that we have experienced historically have been lower than the contractual amount of letters of credit
issued because a significant portion of these conditional commitments expire without being drawn upon.

The table below summarizes our standby letters of credit at December 31, 2021. The maximum potential amount of future payments represents the amount
that could be remitted under these letters of credit if there were a total default by the guaranteed parties, without consideration of possible recoveries under
recourse provisions or from the collateral held or pledged.

Commitments to Invest in Venture Capital and Private Equity Funds

We make commitments to invest in venture capital and private equity funds, which generally makes investments in privately-held companies. Commitments to
invest in these funds are generally made for a 10-year period from the inception of the fund. Although the limited partnership agreements governing these
investments typically do not restrict the general partners from calling 100% of committed capital in one year, it is customary for these funds to call most of the capital
commitments over 5 to 7 years, and in certain cases, the funds may not call 100% of committed capital. The actual timing of future cash requirements to fund these
commitments is generally dependent upon the investment cycle, overall market conditions, and the nature and type of industry in which the privately held companies
operate. The following table details our total capital commitments, unfunded capital commitments, and our ownership percentage in each fund at December 31,
2021:

(1) We adjust quoted market prices of public companies, which are subject to certain sales restrictions. Sales restriction discounts generally range from 10 percent
to 20 percent depending on the duration of the sales restrictions which typically range from three to six months.
(2) Our marketability discount is applied to all private company warrants to account for a general lack of liquidity due to the private nature of the associated
underlying company. The quantitative measure used is based upon various option-pricing models. On a quarterly basis, a sensitivity analysis is performed on our
marketability discount.
(3) We adjust the contractual remaining term of private company warrants based on our estimate of the actual remaining life, which we determine by utilizing
historical data on terminations and exercises. At December 31, 2021, the weighted average contractual remaining term was 6.6 years, compared to our
estimated remaining life of 2.6 years. On a quarterly basis, a sensitivity analysis is performed on our remaining life assumption.
During 2021, 2020 and 2019, we did not have any transfers between Level 3 and Level 1. All other transfers from Level 3 to Level 2 during 2021, 2020 and 2019
were due to the transfer of equity warrant assets from our private portfolio to our public portfolio (see our Level 3 reconciliation above).

Investments in Entities that Calculate Net Asset Value Per Share

FASB guidance over certain fund investments requires that we disclose the fair value of funds, significant investment strategies of the investees, redemption
features of the investees, restrictions on the ability to sell investments, estimate of the period of time over which the underlying assets are expected to be liquidated
by the investee and unfunded commitments related to the investments.

Our investments in debt funds and venture capital and private equity fund investments generally cannot be redeemed. Alternatively, we expect distributions, if
any, to be received primarily through IPOs and M&A activity of the underlying assets of the fund. Subject to applicable requirements under the Volcker Rule, we do
not have any plans to sell any of these fund investments. If we decide to sell these investments in the future, the investee fund9s management must approve of the
buyer before the sale of the investments can be completed. The fair values of the fund investments have been estimated using the net asset value per share of the
investments, adjusted for any differences between our measurement date and the date of the fund investment9s net asset value by using the most recently available
financial information from the investee general partner, for example September 30 , for our December 31 consolidated financial statements, adjusted for any
contributions paid, distributions received from the investment, and significant fund transactions or market events during the reporting period.

The following table is a summary of the estimated fair values of these investments and remaining unfunded commitments for each major category of these
investments as of December 31, 2021:

(Dollars in millions) Carrying Amount Fair Value Unfunded Commitments
Non-marketable securities (fair value accounting):
Venture capital and private equity fund investments (1) $ 338 $ 338 $ 12
Non-marketable securities (equity method accounting):
Venture capital and private equity fund investments (2) 670 670 11
Debt funds (2) 5 5 4
Other investments (2) 34 34 1
Total $ 1,047 $ 1,047 $^24
(1) Venture capital and private equity fund investments within non-marketable securities (fair value accounting) include investments made by our managed funds of
funds and one of our direct venture funds (consolidated VIEs) and investments in venture capital and private equity fund investments (unconsolidated VIEs).
Collectively, these investments in venture capital and private equity funds are primarily in U.S. and global technology and life science/healthcare companies.
Included in the fair value and unfunded commitments of fund investments under fair value accounting are $94 million and $2 million, respectively, attributable
to noncontrolling interests. It is estimated that we will receive distributions from the fund investments over the next 10 to 13 years, depending on the age of the
funds and any potential extensions of terms of the funds.
(2) Venture capital and private equity fund investments, debt funds and other fund investments within non-marketable securities (equity method accounting)
include funds that invest in or lend money to primarily U.S. and global technology and life science/healthcare companies. It is estimated that we will receive
distributions from the funds over the next 5 to 8 years, depending on the age of the funds and any potential extensions of the terms of the funds.

23. Regulatory Matters

SVB Financial and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital adequacy requirements administered by the Federal Reserve Board and the DFPI. The
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 additionally requires that the federal regulatory agencies adopt regulations defining five capital
categories for banks: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized.

We are also subject to a comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations established by the federal banking agencies (the <Capital Rules=),
which implement the Basel III regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. There are three categories of capital under the Capital Rules:
CET 1, additional Tier 1 and Tier 2. Pursuant to the Capital Rules, the minimum capital ratios applicable to SVB Financial and the Bank are as follows:

" 4.5% CET 1 capital to risk-weighted assets;
" 6.0% Tier 1 capital (CET 1 plus Additional Tier 1 capital) to risk-weighted assets;
" 8.0% Total capital (Tier 1 plus Tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets; and
th st
172
Table of Contents
SVB FINANCIAL GROUP AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

" 4.0% Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets (the <leverage ratio=).
We must also meet a 2.5% <buffer= of CET 1 capital to avoid constraints on capital distributions, such as dividends and equity repurchases, and certain bonus
compensation for executive officers. The severity of the constraints would depend on the amount of the shortfall and the banking organization9s <eligible retained
income=.

As of December 31, 2021, both SVB Financial and the Bank exceed the required ratios under the Capital Rules and were considered <well-capitalized= for
purposes of the Federal Reserve9s Regulation Y. The following table presents the capital ratios for the Company and the Bank under federal regulatory guidelines,
compared to the minimum regulatory capital requirements, as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020:

24. Segment Reporting

We have four reportable segments for management reporting purposes: GCB, SVB Private Bank, SVB Capital and SVB Securities. The results of our operating
segments are based on our internal management reporting process.

Our GCB and SVB Private Bank segments primary source of revenue is from NII, which is primarily the difference between interest earned on loans, net of FTP
and interest paid on deposits, net of FTP. Accordingly, these segments are reported using NII, net of FTP. FTP is an internal measurement framework designed to
assess the financial impact of a financial institution9s sources and uses of funds. It is the mechanism by which an earnings credit is given for deposits raised, and an
earnings charge is made for funded loans. FTP is calculated at an instrument level based on account characteristics.

We also evaluate performance based on provision for credit losses, noninterest income and noninterest expense, which are presented as components of
segment operating profit or loss. In calculating each operating segment9s noninterest expense, we consider the direct costs incurred by the operating segment as well
as certain allocated direct costs. As part of this review, we allocate certain corporate overhead costs to a corporate account. We do not allocate income tax expense or
the provision for unfunded credit commitments (included in provision for credit losses) to our segments. Additionally, our management reporting model is predicated
on average asset balances; therefore, period-end asset balances are not presented for segment reporting purposes. Changes in an individual client9s primary
relationship designation have resulted, and in the future may result, in the inclusion of certain clients in different segments in different periods.

Unlike financial reporting, which benefits from the comprehensive structure provided by GAAP, our internal management reporting process is highly subjective,
as there is no comprehensive, authoritative guidance for management reporting. Our management reporting process measures the performance of our operating
segments based on our internal operating structure, which is subject to change from time to time, and is not necessarily comparable with similar information for other
financial services companies.

For reporting purposes, SVB Financial Group has four operating segments for which we report our financial information:
" Global Commercial Bank is comprised of results from the following:
ç Our Commercial Bank products and services are provided by the Bank and its subsidiaries to commercial clients in key innovation markets. The Bank
provides solutions to the financial needs of commercial clients through credit, treasury management, foreign exchange, trade finance and other

prepared in conformity with GAAP. NII consists primarily of interest earned from our fixed income investment portfolio, net of FTP. Noninterest income consists
primarily of gains or losses on equity warrant assets, gains or losses on the sale of AFS securities and gains or losses on equity securities from exercised warrant
assets. Noninterest expense consists primarily of expenses associated with corporate support functions such as finance, human resources, marketing, legal and
other expenses.
(3) The GCB segment includes direct depreciation and amortization of $34 million, $25 million and $20 million for December 31, 2021, December 31, 2020 and
December 31, 2019, respectively.
(4) The internal reporting model used by management to assess segment performance does not calculate income tax expense by segment. Our effective tax rate is a
reasonable approximation of the segment rates.

expected settlements, when we believe it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. When a loss contingency is not
both probable and estimable, we do not establish an accrual. Any such loss estimates are inherently uncertain, based on currently available information and are
subject to management9s judgment and various assumptions. Due to the inherent subjectivity of these estimates and unpredictability of outcomes of legal
proceedings, any amounts accrued may not represent the ultimate resolution of such matters.

To the extent we believe any potential loss relating to such matters may have a material impact on our liquidity, consolidated financial position, results of
operations and/or our business as a whole and is reasonably possible but not probable, we aim to disclose information relating to such potential loss. We also aim to
disclose information relating to any material potential loss that is probable but not reasonably estimable. In such cases, where reasonably practicable, we aim to
provide an estimate of loss or range of potential loss. No disclosures are generally made for any loss contingencies that are deemed to be remote.

Based upon information available to us, our review of lawsuits and claims filed or pending against us to date and consultation with our outside legal counsel, we
have not recognized a material liability for any such matters, nor do we currently expect that these matters will result in a material liability to the Company. However,
the outcome of litigation and other legal and regulatory matters is inherently uncertain, and it is possible that one or more of such matters currently pending or
threatened could have an unanticipated material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated financial position, results of operations and/or our business as a whole,
in the future.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

None.
ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

(a) Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Disclosure controls and procedures are the controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports
that the Company files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods
specified in the SEC rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, among other things, processes, controls and procedures designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management,
including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

The Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief
Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2021, pursuant to Exchange Act
Rule 13a-15(b). Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures
were effective as of December 31, 2021.

We completed our acquisition of Boston Private on July 1, 2021. The scope of management's assessment of the effectiveness the Company's disclosure controls
and procedures did not include the internal controls over financial reporting of Boston Private. This exclusion is in accordance with the SEC Staff's general guidance
that an assessment of a recently acquired business may be omitted from the scope of management9s assessment for one year following the acquisition. Boston Private
represents approximately 2% of our total consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 and approximately 4% of total consolidated assets as of
December 31, 2021.

(b) Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting at the Company. Our internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company's financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with GAAP. A company's
internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that accurately and fairly reflect, in reasonable
detail, transactions and dispositions of the company's assets, (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with GAAP and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorization of management and the
directors of the company, and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company's assets that could have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

As of December 31, 2021, the Company carried out an assessment, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, including
the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Rule 13a-
15(c), as adopted by the SEC under the Exchange Act. In evaluating the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting, management used the
framework established in <Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013),= issued by the COSO. Based on this assessment, management has concluded that, as of
December 31, 2021, the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective. As the Boston Private acquisition occurred in the third quarter of 2021, the
scope of our evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting does not include Boston Private.

KPMG LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the consolidated financial statements of the Company included in this Annual Report
on Form 10-K, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the Company9s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021. The report,
which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company9s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, is included in
"Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" under Part II, Item 8 of this report under the heading <Report of Independent Registered Public
Accounting Firm.=

(c) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management's evaluation during the fourth quarter of the period covered by
this Annual Report on Form 10-K that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Under our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, we are authorized to issue a total of 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock having a par value of $0.001
per share. Holders of our Series A Preferred Stock and Depositary Shares do not have any preemptive or conversion rights. The number of authorized shares of Series
A Preferred Stock under the Certificate of Designations is 350,000, with a <Stated Amount= per share of $1,000.

We have issued Depositary Shares each representing a 1/40th fractional interest in a share of Series A Preferred Stock, which are evidenced by depositary receipts. We
have deposited the underlying shares of the Series A Preferred Stock represented by the Depositary Shares with a depositary pursuant to the Deposit Agreement.
Subject to the terms of the Deposit Agreement, each holder of a Depositary Share is entitled to all the rights and preferences of the underlying Series A Preferred
Stock in proportion to the applicable fraction of a share of Series A Preferred Stock represented by the Depositary Share. These rights include dividend, voting,
redemption and liquidation rights.

Ranking

With respect to the payment of dividends and distributions of assets upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company, the Series A Preferred Stock will
rank:

" senior to our common stock and any other class or series of our stock that ranks junior to the Series A Preferred Stock in the payment of dividends or in the
distribution of assets upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company;

" senior to or on a parity with each other series of our preferred stock we may issue (except for any senior series that may be issued upon the requisite vote or
consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of the shares of the Series A Preferred Stock at the time outstanding and entitled to vote, voting together as a
single class with any other series of preferred stock entitled to vote thereon (to the exclusion of all other series of preferred stock)) with respect to the
payment of dividends and distributions of assets upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company; and

" with respect to distributions of assets upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company, junior to all existing and future indebtedness and
other non-equity claims on us.

Dividends

Holders of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by our board of directors (or a duly authorized committee of our board of
directors), but only out of funds legally available therefor, non-cumulative cash dividends at an annual rate of 5.250% of the Stated Amount per share, payable
quarterly in arrears, on February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15 of each year (a <Dividend Payment Date=), beginning on February 15, 2020. Subject to the
terms of the Deposit Agreement, the dividend payable on each Depositary Share will be in an amount equal to 1/40th of the dividend declared and payable on the
related share of Series A Preferred Stock.

So long as any share of Series A Preferred Stock remains outstanding, unless dividends on all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock for the most recently
completed dividend period have been paid in full or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof has been set aside for payment, (i) no dividend may be
declared or paid or set aside for payment, and no distribution may be made, on any share of common stock, (ii) no monies may be paid or made available for a sinking
fund for the redemption or retirement of common stock, and (iii) no shares of common stock may be purchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration by
the Company, subject to certain exceptions.

Company Redemption

The Company may, at its option, redeem the shares of Series A Preferred Stock (i) in whole or in part, from time to time, on any Dividend Payment Date on or after the
Dividend Payment Date on February 15, 2025 or (ii) in whole but not in part at any time within 90 days following a Regulatory Capital Treatment Event (as defined in
the Certificate of Designations), in each case, at a cash redemption price equal to the Stated Amount, together with any declared and unpaid dividends, without regard
to any undeclared dividends, to but excluding the redemption date.

If we redeem the Series A Preferred Stock, the Depositary Shares will be redeemed from the proceeds received by the Depositary resulting from the redemption of the
Series A Preferred Stock held by the Depositary. The redemption price per Depositary Share will be equal to 1/40th of the redemption price per share payable with
respect to the Series A Preferred Stock (equivalent to $25 per Depositary Share), plus any declared and unpaid dividends, without accumulation of any undeclared
dividends, on the shares of Series A Preferred Stock. Whenever we redeem shares of the Series A Preferred Stock held by the Depositary, the Depositary will redeem,
as of the same redemption date, the number of the Depositary Shares representing shares of the Series A Preferred Stock so redeemed.

In case of any redemption of less than all of the outstanding Depositary Shares, the Depositary Shares to be redeemed will be selected either pro rata or by lot. In any
case, the Depositary will redeem the Depositary Shares only in increments of 40 Depositary Shares and any integral multiple thereof. The Depositary will provide
notice of redemption to record holders of the Depositary

Shares not less than 30 and not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption of the Series A Preferred Stock and the related Depositary Shares.

Voting

The holders of Series A Preferred Stock will have no voting rights except as set forth in the Certificate of Designations or as otherwise from time to time required by
law. If holders of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to vote on a particular matter, holders of Depositary Shares will be entitled to the applicable fraction of a vote
per depositary share they hold representing those shares of preferred stock.

To the extent possible, the Depositary will vote the amount of the Series A Preferred Stock represented by the Depositary Shares in accordance with the instructions it
receives. We will agree to take all reasonable actions that the Depositary determines are necessary to enable the Depositary to vote as instructed. If the Depositary
does not receive specific instructions from the holders of any Depositary Shares, it will vote all Depositary Shares held by it proportionately with instructions received.

Right to Elect Two Directors upon Nonpayment. If and when dividends on Series A Preferred Stock have not been declared and paid in full for at least six quarterly
dividend periods, the authorized number of directors then constituting our board of directors will automatically be increased by two. Holders of Series A Preferred
Stock (together with the holders of all other voting preferred stock then outstanding), voting as a single class, will be entitled to elect the two additional members of
the board of directors. These voting rights will continue until dividends on the shares of the Series A Preferred Stock and any such other series of voting preferred
stock for at least four consecutive quarterly dividend periods, in the case of the Series A Preferred Stock, or the equivalent thereof, in the case of any other series of
voting preferred stock, as applicable, following the nonpayment shall have been fully paid. Then, the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock and all other holders of
voting preferred stock shall be divested of the foregoing voting rights (subject to revesting in the event of each subsequent nonpayment), the term of office of each
preferred stock director so elected shall terminate and the number of directors on the board of directors shall automatically decrease by two.

Other Matters****. The affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of all of the then-outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock entitled to vote,
voting separately as a single class with any other series of preferred stock entitled to vote thereon, is required to:

" authorize or increase the authorized amount of, or issue shares of, any class or series of our capital stock ranking senior to the class of Series A Preferred
Stock with respect to the payment of dividends or in the distribution of assets on any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company;
" amend the provisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Amended and Restated Bylaws or the Certificate of Designations that
would alter or change the voting powers, preferences or special rights of the Series A Preferred Stock so as to affect them adversely; or
" consummate a binding share-exchange or reclassification involving the Series A Preferred Stock, or a merger or consolidation of us with or into another entity
unless the shares of Series A Preferred Stock (i) remain outstanding or (ii) are converted into or exchanged for preference securities of the surviving entity or
any entity controlling such surviving entity and such new preference securities have terms that are not materially less favorable than the Series A Preferred
Stock, taken as a whole.

Liquidation Rights

In the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, holders of Series A Preferred Stock have the right to a ratable portion of assets remaining after satisfaction in
full of the prior rights of our creditors, all liabilities and prior rights of holders of any securities ranking senior to our preferred stock. Holders of Depositary Shares will
generally receive distributions in proportion to the number of Depositary Shares they hold.

Charges of Depositary

We will pay all transfer and other taxes and governmental charges arising solely from the existence of the depositary arrangements. We will pay associated charges of
the Depositary in connection with the initial deposit of the Series A Preferred Stock and any redemption of the Series A Preferred Stock. Holders of the Depositary
Shares will pay transfer, income and other taxes and governmental charges and such other charges as are expressly provided in the Deposit Agreement to be for their
accounts. If these charges have not been paid by the holders of the Depositary Shares, the Depositary may refuse to transfer Depositary Shares, withhold dividends
and distributions, and sell the Depositary Shares.

CERTAIN PROVISIONS THAT MAY HAVE AN ANTI-TAKOVER EFFECT
The following descriptions of certain provisions that may have an anti-takeover effect are summaries and are qualified in their entirety by reference to (i) the
Company9s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and the Amended and Restated Bylaws (which are exhibits to the Annual Report of which this exhibit is
a part) and (ii) the Delaware General Corporation Law.

Restrictions on Ownership

The Bank Holding Company Act requires any <bank holding company,= as defined in the Bank Holding Company Act, to obtain the approval of the Board of Governors
of the Federal Reserve (<Federal Reserve Board=) prior to the acquisition of 5% or more of our common stock. Any person, other than a bank holding company, is
required to obtain prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board to acquire 10% or more of our common stock under the Change in Bank Control Act. Any holder of 25%
or more of our common stock, or a holder of 5% or more if such holder otherwise exercises a <controlling influence= over us, is subject to regulation as a bank holding
company under the Bank Holding Company Act.

Before acquiring control of a California state-chartered bank or its parent company, a person or entity must obtain the prior approval of the California Department of
Business Oversight under the California Banking Law. <Control= means the power to vote 25% or more of the outstanding voting securities or the power to direct the
management and policies of a bank or parent company. In addition, direct or indirect ownership, control or power to vote 10% or more of the outstanding voting
securities of the bank or parent company is presumed to constitute control of the bank or parent company unless the acquiring person provides the California
Department of Business Oversight with sufficient information to rebut this presumption.

Under the regulations of the Federal Reserve Board implementing the Bank Holding Company Act, if any holder of any series of preferred stock (including the Series A
Preferred Stock) is or becomes entitled to vote for the election of directors, such series will be deemed a class of voting securities and a company holding 25% or more
of the series, or such lower amount of the Series A Preferred Stock, may be deemed, when coupled with other factors, to constitute a <controlling influence= over the
issuer, and will be subject to regulation as a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act. In addition, at the time the series is deemed a class of voting
securities, any other bank holding company will be required to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve Board under the Bank Holding Company Act to acquire or
maintain more than 5% of that series. Any other person (other than the bank holding company) will be required to obtain the non-objection of the Federal Reserve
Board under the Change in Bank Control Act of 1978, as amended, to acquire or maintain 10% or more of that series.

ARTICLE I

INTRODUCTION

SVB Financial Group (the <Company=), organized as a C-corporation, maintains the SVB Financial Group 401(k) and Employee Stock

Ownership Plan (the <Plan=), for the exclusive benefit of Participants and their Beneficiaries. The Plan was originally established

effective January 1, 1985. Effective March 1, 1995, the Silicon Valley Bancshares Employee Stock Ownership Plan was merged with and

into the Plan. Effective January 1, 2003, the Silicon Valley Bank Money Purchase Pension Plan was merged with and into the Plan. The

Plan was most recently restated effective January 1, 2014. The Company hereby further amends and restates the Plan in its entirety,

effective July 1, 2021 (except as otherwise stated herein or as required by law).

The Plan is intended to be a tax-qualified profit sharing plan with a related tax-exempt trust under Code Sections 401(a) and 501(a),

respectively, and includes a tax-qualified cash or deferred arrangement under Code Section 401(k), a matching contribution

arrangement under Code Section 401(m), and includes discretionary profit sharing contributions. The Plan also is intended to be an

employee stock ownership plan (<ESOP=) under Code Section 4975(e)(7) and Code Section 409(l) and to provide participant-directed

investments in accordance with ERISA Section 404(c).

(a)Definitions. For purposes of this Section, the following definitions apply:

(i) <Annual Additions= means, for any Limitation Year, the sum of the following amounts credited to an Eligible
Participant9s Accounts in all qualified defined contribution plans maintained by an Employer: (i) Employer
contributions, (ii) Employee contributions, and (iii) forfeitures. Employee Contributions, Matching Contributions
or After-Tax Contributions that exceed the maximum permitted under the ADP Test (as described in Section 5.3)
or the ACP Test (as described in Section 5.5) are Annual Additions, even if they are distributed or forfeited to
correct the violation. Employee Contributions in excess of the maximum permitted by Code Section 402(g) that
are timely distributed are not treated as Annual Additions. Annual Additions also do not include loan
repayments, direct transfers, restorative payments, Catch-Up Contributions and Rollover Contributions. In
addition, with respect to the dollar limitation under the heading <Maximum Permissible Amount,= below, Annual
Additions include contributions to a welfare benefit trust (described in Code Section 419A(d)(2)) to provide post-
retirement medical benefits for a Key Employee (as defined in Code Section 416(i)).
(ii) <Limitation Year= means the calendar year.

(b)Maximum Permissible Amount. The Annual Additions to a Participant9s Accounts for any Limitation Year will not
exceed the lesser of (i) $40,000, adjusted as described in Code Section 415(d) or (ii) 100% of the Participant9s
Compensation for the Plan Year. Code Section 415 and the applicable Income Tax Regulations are incorporated herein by
reference.
(c)Excess Annual Additions. If the Annual Additions actually made to a Participant9s Accounts exceed the Maximum
Permissible Amount, the Participant9s Annual Additions for the Limitation Year in which the excess Annual Additions
arise will be corrected using any reasonable method, including but not limited to methods approved by the Internal
Revenue Service pursuant to the Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System.
(d)Aggregation of Plans. For purposes of this Section, all defined contribution plans of an Employer will be treated as one
defined contribution plan. If aggregate Annual Additions under more than one such plan would otherwise exceed the
Maximum Permissible Amount, the last amounts contributed shall be the first amounts treated as creating the excess
unless the other plan requires use of a different rule.
5.2 Distribution of Excess Amounts. For purposes of this Section 5.2, <Elective Deferrals= means with respect to any calendar

year, any amount allocated to a Participant9s Employee Contributions Account pursuant to Section 4.3, and any contributions on behalf of an
individual under a qualified cash or deferred arrangement described in Code Section 402(e)(3), under a simplified employee pension plan

described in Code Section 408(k)(6), and under a salary reduction agreement to purchase an annuity contract described in Code Section 403(b).

Elective Deferrals shall not include any deferrals properly distributed as excess Annual Additions.

19

If the Committee is timely notified by a Participant, or otherwise determines that a Participant9s Elective Deferrals exceed the amount permitted

by Code Section 401(a)(30) or Code Section 402(g), the excess amount (<Excess Elective Deferral=), together with income earned on the Excess

Elective Deferral during the calendar year to which the Excess Elective Deferral relates, will be distributed to the Participant by April 15 following

the end of the taxable year in which the Excess Elective Deferral was made. Income will be determined in accordance with any reasonable

method used for allocating income to Participants9 Accounts during the Plan Year. Federal, state or local income tax withholding obligations

attributable to a distribution may be satisfied out of the distribution, if not satisfied out of other compensation. If Employee Contributions are

distributed, they will be accompanied by the forfeiture of a proportionate share of Matching Contributions. The amount of Excess Elective
Deferrals for a calendar year that would otherwise be distributable to the Participant will be re-characterized to the extent possible as Catch-Up

Contributions and will be reduced by the amount of Excess Contributions, if any, previously distributed to the Participant for the Plan Year

beginning in that calendar year.

5.3 Discrimination Testing of Employee Contributions. Employee Contributions made under the Plan must satisfy the

nondiscrimination tests set forth in Code Section 401(k)(3), Income Tax Regulations section 1.401(k)-2, and other applicable guidance issued by

the Internal Revenue Service under Code Section 401(k). Subsequent guidance is incorporated herein by reference. In satisfying the
nondiscrimination test set forth in Code Section 401(k)(3)(A)(ii), the current year testing method will be used.

(a)Definitions.

(i) Actual Deferral Percentage (<ADP=). <Actual Deferral Percentage= or <ADP= means, with respect to each
Eligible Participant, a percentage, calculated as the sum of the amount of Employee Contributions, Qualified
Matching Contributions, and Qualified Nonelective Contributions, made on behalf of such Eligible Participant for
the Plan Year (and allocated for purposes of the ADP test), divided by such Eligible Participant9s Compensation
for that Plan Year. Amounts contributed to the Plan as Catch-up Contributions that are later re-characterized as
Employee Contributions shall be included as Employee Contributions for this purpose.
(ii) Average ADP. <Average ADP= means the average (expressed as a percentage) of the ADPs for all Eligible
Participants in the relevant group.
(iii) Excess 401(k) Contributions. <Excess 401(k) Contributions= means, with respect to any Plan Year, the excess of
(A) the aggregate amount of Contributions actually taken into account in computing the ADPs of Highly
Compensated Employees for such Plan Year, over (B) the maximum amount of such Contributions permitted by
the ADP test. Excess 401(k) Contributions shall continue to be treated as Annual Additions under the Plan.
(b)ADP Test. One of the following ADP tests shall be satisfied for each Plan Year:

(i) the Average ADP for Eligible Participants who are Highly Compensated Employees for the Plan Year shall not
exceed the Plan Year9s Average ADP for Eligible Participants who were Non-Highly Compensated Employees for
the Plan Year multiplied by one and twenty-five one-hundredths (1.25); or
(ii) the Average ADP for Eligible Participants who are Highly Compensated Employees for the Plan Year shall not
exceed the Plan Year9s Average ADP for Eligible Participants who were Non-Highly Compensated Employees for
the Plan Year multiplied by two (2), provided that the ADP for Eligible Participants who are Highly Compensated
Employees does not exceed the Average ADP for
20

Eligible Participants who were Non-Highly Compensated Employees for the Plan Year by more than two (2)
percentage points.
5.4 Corrective Procedure for Discriminatory Employee Contributions.

(a)Correction of Excess 401(k) Contributions. The Committee may take any and all steps it deems necessary or
appropriate to ensure compliance with the limitations of Section 5.3(b). Such steps shall include, without limitation, one
or any combination of the following:
(i) restricting the amount of Employee Contributions on behalf of Highly Compensated Employees;

(ii) distributing Excess 401(k) Contributions to the Highly Compensated Employees who made such Excess 401(k)
Contributions, pursuant to paragraph (e) below;
(iii) treating Matching Contributions as Qualified Matching Contributions. The amount of Qualified Matching
Contributions made under this Plan and taken into account for purposes of calculating the ADP test, subject to
such other requirements as may be prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, shall be such Qualified Matching
Contributions as are needed to meet the ADP test; and/or
(iv) accepting from the Employer a Qualified Nonelective Contribution for Eligible Participants who are Non-Highly
Compensated Employees. If Qualified Nonelective Contributions are made by an Employer in its sole discretion
pursuant to this Section, such contributions shall be made solely to those Eligible Participants who are Non-
Highly Compensated Employees employed on the last day of the Plan Year and to those who are Non-Highly
Compensated Employees when they ceased to be Eligible Participants during the Plan Year due to a transfer of
employment to a foreign subsidiary of the Company that resulted in such Employee no longer being on the
United States payroll of a Participating Employer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an otherwise Eligible
Participant who incurs a Disability during the Plan Year or whose employment with the Employer terminates as a
result of death, or Normal Retirement or Early Retirement shall, for purposes of this Section, be deemed to have
been employed by the Participating Employer on the last day of the Plan Year. The amount to be allocated will
be determined on a pro-rata basis in proportion to the Compensation of such Eligible Participants for the Plan
Year.
(b) Calculation of Excess 401(k) Contributions. The amount of Excess 401(k) Contributions for Highly Compensated
Employees for a Plan Year shall be calculated by the following method, under which the ADP of the Highly Compensated
Employee with the highest ADP is reduced to the extent required to enable the Plan to satisfy the ADP test or to cause
such Highly Compensated Employee9s ADP to equal the ADP of the Highly Compensated Employee with the next highest
ADP:
(i) the Employee Contributions of the Highly Compensated Employee with the highest ADP shall be reduced; such
reduction shall continue, as necessary, until such Highly Compensated Employee9s ADP equals that (those) of the
Highly Compensated Employee(s) with the second highest ADP;
(ii) following the application of paragraph (i), if it is still necessary to reduce Highly Compensated Employees9
Employee Contributions, then the Contributions of
21

(or allocations on behalf of, if applicable) Highly Compensated Employees with the highest and second highest
ADPs shall be reduced, as necessary, until such Employees9 ADP equals that of the Highly Compensated
Employee(s) with the third highest ADP;
(iii) following the application of paragraph (ii), if it is still necessary to reduce Highly Compensated Employees9
Employee Contributions, then the procedure, the beginning of which is described in paragraphs (i) and (ii) above,
shall continue until no further reductions are necessary; and
(iv) amounts determined pursuant to paragraphs (i) through (iii) above shall be combined. The resulting sum shall be
the Excess 401(k) Contributions, and the portion of the total to be allocated to each affected Highly
Compensated Employee shall be determined pursuant to paragraph (c) below.
(c)Allocation of Excess 401(k) Contributions. The amount of Excess 401(k) Contributions to be allocated to a Highly

Compensated Employee for a Plan Year shall be determined by the following method:

(i) the Employee Contributions of the Highly Compensated Employee(s) with the highest dollar amount of
Employee Contributions shall be reduced, as necessary, until either such Highly Compensated Employee9s dollar
amount of Employee Contributions equals that of the Highly Compensated Employee(s) with the next highest
dollar amounts of Employee Contributions, or until no unallocated Excess 401(k) Contributions remain;
(ii) following the application of paragraph (i), if unallocated Excess 401(k) Contributions remain, then Employee
Contributions of the Highly Compensated Employees with the highest and second highest dollar amount(s) of
Employee Contributions shall be reduced, as necessary, until either such Highly Compensated Employees9 dollar
amount of Employee Contributions equal those of the Highly Compensated Employee(s) with the third highest
dollar amount(s) of Employee Contributions, or until no unallocated Excess 401(k) Contributions remain;
(iii) following the application of paragraph (ii), if unallocated Excess 401(k) Contributions remain, then the
procedure, the beginning of which is described in paragraphs (i) and (ii), shall continue until no further
reductions are necessary; and
(iv) Excess 401(k) Contributions in an amount equal to the reduction of Employee Contributions determined in
paragraphs (i) through (iii) above with respect to a Highly Compensated Employee shall be allocated to that
Highly Compensated Employee and, as determined by the Committee, distributed pursuant to paragraph (e)
below.
(d)Character of Excess 401(k) Contributions. The Excess 401(k) Contributions of a Highly Compensated Employee shall be

deemed to consist of Contributions and allocations as determined according to the following order:

(i) first, the Highly Compensated Employee9s Excess 401(k) Contributions shall be deemed to consist of Employee
Contributions, if any, which exceed the highest rate or amount at which Employee Contributions are matched;
provided, however, such Contributions shall be offset by any Excess Elective Deferrals distributable to the
Employee pursuant to Section 5.2; and
22

(ii) second, the Highly Compensated Employee9s Excess 401(k) Contributions shall be deemed to consist of any
Employee Contributions and any Qualified Matching Contributions, each in proportion to the Highly
Compensated Employee9s total Employee Contributions and Qualified Matching Contributions for the Plan Year;
provided, however, any Employee Contributions characterized as Excess 401(k) Contributions under this
paragraph shall be offset by any Excess Elective Deferrals distributable to the Employee pursuant to Section 5.2
and not taken into account under paragraph (a)(i) above.
(e)Distribution of Excess 401(k) Contributions. If, pursuant to paragraph (a)(ii) above, the Committee elects to distribute
Excess 401(k) Contributions, which shall then be treated as Annual Additions (adjusted for Earnings) to Highly
Compensated Employees, then the Committee shall make such distributions in accordance with the following timing
restrictions:
(i) on or before the date which falls two and one-half (2 1/2) months after the last day of the Plan Year for which
such Excess 401(k) Contributions were made, to avoid liability for the Federal excise tax and state excise tax, if
applicable, which will be imposed on Excess 401(k) Contributions distributed after such date; and
(ii) in any event, such Excess 401(k) Contributions shall be distributed before the last day of the Plan Year next
following the Plan Year for which such Excess 401(k) Contributions were made.
(f) Adjustment for Earnings. After the Committee has determined the aggregate amount and character of Excess 401(k)
Contributions to be distributed to a given Highly Compensated Employee, then that amount shall be adjusted for
Earnings through the end of the Plan Year to which the Excess 401(k) Contributions relate. The Earnings allocable to
Excess 401(k) Contributions shall be calculated by the Committee using any reasonable method for computing the
Earnings allocable to Excess 401(k) Contributions; provided, however, that the method shall not violate Code Section
401(a)(4), and that the method shall be used consistently for all similarly-situated Eligible Participants, for all corrective
distributions under the Plan for the Plan Year, and for allocating Earnings to Eligible Participants9 Accounts.
(g)Matching Contributions Related to Excess 401(k) Contributions. Any Matching Contributions attributable to Excess
401(k) Contributions, plus any Earnings allocable thereto, shall be forfeited and applied as provided in Section 6.2.
5.5 Discrimination Testing of Matching Contributions and/or After-Tax Contributions. Notwithstanding anything contained in

the Plan to the contrary, the Plan must meet the nondiscrimination requirements of Code Section 401(a)(4) with respect to the amount

of Matching Contributions and/or After-Tax Contributions made to the Plan. Such requirements will be met if the Plan satisfies the

nondiscrimination tests set forth in Code Section 401(m)(2), Income Tax Regulations section 1.401(m)-2, and other applicable guidance

issued by the Internal Revenue Service under Code Section 401(m). Subsequent guidance is incorporated herein by reference. In

satisfying the nondiscrimination tests set forth in Code Section 401(m)(2), the current year method will be used.

(a) Definitions.

(i) Actual Contribution Percentage (<ACP=). <Actual Contribution Percentage= or <ACP= means, with respect to each
Eligible Participant, the Eligible
23

Participant9s Contribution Percentage Amount, divided by their Compensation for that Plan Year;

(ii) Average ACP. <Average ACP= means the average of the ACPs of the Eligible Participants in a group.

(iii) Contribution Percentage Amount. <Contribution Percentage Amount= means the sum of Matching
Contributions, Qualified Matching Contributions (if such Qualified Matching Contributions are not included in the
ADP Test) and After-Tax Contributions made under the Plan on behalf of an Eligible Participant for the Plan Year.
In addition, to the extent elected by the Committee for purposes of calculating the ACP test, <Contribution
Percentage Amount= may also include Qualified Nonelective Contributions, Employee Contributions, and/or pre-
tax and/or qualified nonelective contributions under other Plans of the Employer (subject to such requirements
as may be prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury); provided, however, that the amount of Qualified
Nonelective Contributions, Employee Contributions and/or pre-tax contributions under other Plans of the
Employer used in calculating the ADP test may not be used in calculating the ACP test. Such Contribution
Percentage Amount shall not include Matching Contributions or After-Tax Contributions that are forfeited either
to correct Excess Matching Contributions or After-Tax Contributions or because the Contributions to which they
relate are Excess Elective Deferrals or Excess 401(k) Contributions.
(iv) Excess Matching Contributions and/or After-Tax Contributions. <Excess Matching Contributions and/or After-
Tax Contributions= means with respect to any Plan Year, the excess of (A) the aggregate amount of Contributions
actually taken into account in computing the Average ACP of Highly Compensated Employees for such Plan Year,
over (B) the maximum amount of such Contributions permitted by the ACP test.
(b)ACP Test. One of the following tests shall be satisfied for each Plan Year:

(i) the Average ACP for Eligible Participants who are Highly Compensated Employees for such Plan Year shall not
exceed the Plan Year9s Average ACP for Eligible Participants who were Non-Highly Compensated Employees for
the Plan Year multiplied by one and twenty-five one-hundredths (1.25); or
(ii) the Average ACP for Eligible Participants who are Highly Compensated Employees for such Plan Year shall not
exceed the Plan Year9s Average ACP for Eligible Participants who were Non-Highly Compensated Employees for
the Plan Year multiplied by two (2); provided, however, that the Average ACP for Eligible Participants who are
Highly Compensated Employees does not exceed the Average ACP for Eligible Participants who were Non-Highly
Compensated Employees for the Plan Year by more than two (2) percentage points.
5.6 Corrective Procedure for Discriminatory Matching Contributions and/or After-Tax Contributions.

(a)Correction of Discriminatory Matching or After-Tax Contributions. The Committee shall have the power to take any
and all steps it deems necessary or appropriate to ensure compliance with the limitations described in Section 5.5(b),
including, without limitation, the following:
24

(i) distributing vested Excess Matching Contributions and/or After-Tax Contributions to Highly Compensated
Employees who received such allocations, pursuant to paragraph (e) below;
(ii) treating that portion of Excess Matching Contributions that consists of unvested allocations of Matching
Contributions to the Matching Contributions Accounts of Highly Compensated Employees as amounts to be
reallocated, pursuant to paragraph (d) below;
(iii) limiting the amount of Matching Contributions or After-Tax Contributions allocated to the Matching
Contributions Accounts or After-Tax Contributions Account of Highly Compensated Employees; and/or
(iv) accepting from the Employer a Qualified Nonelective Contribution for Eligible Participants who are Non-Highly
Compensated Employees. If Qualified Nonelective Contributions are made by the Employer in its sole discretion
pursuant to this Section, such contributions shall be made solely to those Eligible Participants who are Non-
Highly Compensated Employees employed on the last day of the Plan Year and to those who are Non-Highly
Compensated Employees when they ceased to be Eligible Participants during the Plan Year due to a transfer of
employment to a foreign subsidiary of the Company that resulted in such Employee no longer being on the
United States payroll of a Participating Employer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an otherwise Eligible
Participant who incurs a Disability during the Plan Year or whose employment with the Employer terminates as a
result of death, or Normal Retirement or Early Retirement shall, for purposes of this Section, be deemed to have
been employed by the Participating Employer on the last day of the Plan Year. The amount to be allocated will
be determined on a pro-rata basis in proportion to the Compensation of such Eligible Participants for the Plan
Year.
(b)Timing of Distribution of Excess Matching and/or After-Tax Contributions. Notwithstanding any contrary provisions
in this Plan, if, pursuant to paragraph (a)(i) or (ii) above, the Committee elects to distribute or reallocate Excess Matching
Contributions and/or After-Tax Contributions (adjusted for Earnings), then the Committee shall take such action(s) on or
before the date which falls two and one-half (2½) months after the last day of the Plan Year for which such Excess
Matching Contributions and/or After-Tax Contributions were made, if the Employer wishes to avoid liability for the
Federal excise tax and state excise tax, if applicable, which will be imposed on Excess Matching Contributions and/or
After-Tax Contributions distributed or reallocated after such date, but in any event, before the last day of the Plan Year
next following the Plan Year for which such Contributions were made.

(c)Determination of Amount of Excess Matching Contributions and/or After-Tax Contributions. The amount of Excess

Matching Contributions and/or After-Tax Contributions for Highly Compensated Employees for a Plan Year shall be
determined by the following method, to enable the Plan to satisfy the ACP test:
(i) first, the allocations of Contributions taken into account in determining the ACP (<ACP Allocations=) of the Highly
Compensated Employee with the highest ACP shall be reduced, as necessary, until such Employee9s ACP equals
those of the Highly Compensated Employee(s) with the second highest ACP;
25

(ii) second, following the application of paragraph (i), if it is still necessary to reduce Highly Compensated
Employees9 ACP Allocations, then the Contributions of Highly Compensated Employees with the highest and
second highest ACPs shall be reduced, as necessary, until each affected Employee9s ACP equals that (those) of
the Highly Compensated Employee(s) with the third highest ACP;
(iii) third, following the application of paragraph (ii), if it is still necessary to reduce Highly Compensated Employees9
ACP Allocations, then the procedure, the beginning of which is described in paragraphs (i) and (ii), shall continue
until no further reductions are necessary; and
(iv) fourth, amounts determined pursuant to paragraphs (i) through (iii) shall be combined. The resulting sum shall
be the Excess Matching Contributions and/or After-Tax Contributions, and the portion of the total to be
allocated to each affected Highly Compensated Employee shall be determined pursuant to paragraph (d) below.
(d)Allocation of Excess Matching Contributions and/or After-Tax Contributions. The amount of Excess Matching

Contributions and/or After-Tax Contributions to be allocated to a Highly Compensated Employee for a Plan Year shall be
determined by the following method to enable the Plan to satisfy the ACP test:
(i) first, the ACP Allocations of the Highly Compensated Employee(s) with the highest dollar amount of ACP
Allocations shall be reduced, as necessary, until either such Employee9s dollar amount of ACP Allocations equals
those of the Highly Compensated Employee(s) with the second highest dollar amount of ACP Allocations or until
no ACP Allocations remain;
(ii) second, following the application of paragraph (i), if unallocated ACP Allocations remain, then ACP Allocations of
Highly Compensated Employees with the highest and second highest dollar amount of ACP Allocations shall be
reduced, as necessary, until either each affected Employee9s dollar amount of ACP Allocations equals that
(those) of the Highly Compensated Employee(s) with the third highest dollar amount of ACP Allocations, or until
no ACP Allocations remain;
(iii) third, following the application of paragraph (ii), if unallocated ACP Allocations remain, the procedure, the
beginning of which is outlined in paragraphs (i) and (ii), shall continue until no further reductions are necessary,
or until no further unallocated ACP Allocations remain; and
(iv) fourth, Excess Matching Contributions and/or After-Tax Contributions in an amount equal to the reductions of
ACP Allocations determined in paragraphs (i) through (iii) above with respect to a Highly Compensated Employee
shall be allocated to that Highly Compensated Employee and, as determined by the Committee, distributed
pursuant to paragraph (e) below.
(e)Distribution of Excess Matching Contributions and/or After-Tax Contributions. After the procedure outlined in
paragraph (d) above is completed, all amounts of Excess Matching Contributions and/or After-Tax Contributions shall be
forfeited (if forfeitable) or distributed (if distributable) to the respective Highly Compensated Employees to whose
Accounts the Excess Matching Contributions and/or After-Tax Contributions were made. Excess Matching Contributions
and/or After-Tax Contributions for each affected Highly Compensated Employee shall be forfeited (if

26

forfeitable) or distributed (if distributable) from the following Accounts in the following order:

(i) the Highly Compensated Employee9s After-Tax Contributions Account;

(ii) the Highly Compensated Employee9s Matching Contributions Account;

(iii) the Highly Compensated Employee9s Qualified Nonelective Contributions Account;

(iv) the Highly Compensated Employee9s Qualified Matching Contributions Account;

(v) the Highly Compensated Employee9s Employee Contributions Account;

(vi) the Highly Compensated Employee9s Roth Contributions Account.

(f) Adjustment for Earnings. After the Committee has determined the aggregate amount and character of Excess Matching

Contributions and/or After-Tax Contributions to be forfeited or distributed to a given Highly Compensated Employee,
then that amount shall be adjusted for Earnings. Earnings shall be calculated through the end of the Plan Year to which
the Excess Matching Contributions relate. The Earnings allocable to Excess Matching Contributions and/or After-Tax
Contributions shall be calculated by the Committee using any reasonable method for computing the Earnings allocable
to Excess Matching Contributions and/or After-Tax Contributions; provided, however, that the method shall not violate
Code Section 401(a)(4), and that the method shall be used consistently for all similarly-situated Participants, for all
corrective distributions under the Plan for the Plan Year, and for allocating Earnings to Participants9 Accounts.
27

ARTICLE VI

VESTING AND FORFEITURES

6.1 Vested Interest.

(a) A Participant9s interest in their Employee Contributions Account, After-Tax Contributions Account, Catch-Up
Contributions Account, Matching Contributions Account, After-Tax Rollover Account, Safe Harbor Match Account,
Rollover Contributions Account, Prior ESOP Account and Prior Match Account under this Plan shall be at all times fully
vested and nonforfeitable.
(b) A Participant9s interest in their Money Purchase Pension Account, ESOP Account and Profit Sharing Account shall be fully
vested and nonforfeitable upon the Participant9s Normal Retirement, Covered Termination, death, or Disability, provided
that the Participant is employed by the Employer immediately prior to such time. For purposes of this Section 6.1(b), a
<Covered Termination= means a termination of an Eligible Participant9s employment within twenty-four (24) months
following a Change in Control, as that term is defined in the SVB Financial Group Change in Control Severance Plan (<CIC
Plan=) that is either (i) a voluntary termination for Good Reason or (ii) an involuntary termination other than for Cause.
For purposes of the preceding sentence, the terms Good Reason and Cause generally shall have the meanings given
those terms in the CIC Plan except that each Eligible Participant shall be treated as if covered (i.e., as a <Covered
Employee=) under the CIC Plan solely for purposes of applying the definitions of Good Reason and Cause under this Plan.
(c)In all other cases, a Participant9s Interest in their Money Purchase Pension Account, ESOP Account and Profit Sharing
Account shall be subject to the following vesting schedule:
Years of Service Vested Percentage

Less than 1 year 0%

1 year but less than 2 years 20%

2 years but less than 3 years 40%

3 years but less than 4 years 60%

4 years but less than 5 years 80%

5 years or more 100%

(d) The crediting of service shall be subject to the following rules:

(i) If a Participant who has voluntarily terminated or has been discharged returns to employment and is credited
with an hour of service on or before incurring a Break in Service, then that Participant shall receive credit for the
time elapsed during that absence.
(ii) If a Participant is absent for a reason other than termination or discharge and then voluntarily terminates or is
discharged, then to receive credit for the time elapsed during that absence, the Participant must be credited
with one (1) hour of service by the date that is the first anniversary of the first day of the absence.
28

(iii) If a Participant has a Break in Service of five (5) years or more, then service after such Break in Service shall not
be taken into account for purposes of determining the nonforfeitable percentage of the Participant9s vested
Account balance that accrued prior to such Break in Service.
(iv) If a Participant has less than one (1) Year of Service, then service prior to a Break in Service shall not be taken
into account for purposes of determining the nonforfeitable percentage of the Participant9s vested Account
balance if the period of severance equals or exceeds the Participant9s service before such period of severance.
(e) If the vesting schedule is subsequently amended, then in the case of an Employee who is a Participant as of the later of
the date such amendment is adopted or the date it becomes effective, the nonforfeitable percentage (determined as of
such date) of such Employee9s Employer-derived accrued benefit will not be less than the percentage computed under
the Plan without regard to such amendment. In addition, if the amended vesting schedule provides less rapid vesting, if
the Plan is amended in any way that directly or indirectly affects the computation of the Participant9s nonforfeitable
percentage, or if the Plan is deemed amended by an automatic change to a Top-Heavy vesting schedule (described in
Article XI), then each Participant who is credited with three (3) Years of Service and whose Account(s) would have vested
more rapidly prior to the amendment, may irrevocably elect during the election period to have the nonforfeitable
percentage of their Account(s), as applicable, calculated without regard to such amendment. For purposes of this
Section, the election period shall begin the date the amendment is adopted, and shall end on the date sixty (60) days
after the latest of: (i) the date the amendment is adopted, (ii) the date the amendment becomes effective, or (iii) the
date the Participant is issued written notice of the amendment by the Administrator or the Employer.
(f) For purposes of vesting, a Participant9s Days of Service and Years of Service with Leerink Holdings LLC for periods before
such entity was a member of a controlled group of corporations (as defined under Code Section 414(b)) that includes the
Company shall be recognized, provided that such Participant was employed by Leerink Holdings LLC on the day
immediately prior to the acquisition date.
(g) Effective July 1, 2021, for purposes of vesting, a Participant9s Days of Service and Years of Service with Boston Private
Financial Holdings, Inc. for periods before such entity was a member of a controlled group of corporations (as defined
under Code Section 414(b)) that includes the Company shall be recognized.
6.2 Forfeitures.

(a) If a Participant is required to take a distribution pursuant to Section 7.9 (the <cash-out rule=), then, following the
Participant9s Severance Date, the Participant shall receive a distribution of the value of the entire vested portion of their
Account balance in accordance with Article VII. The nonvested portion of the Participant9s Account balance shall be
treated as a forfeiture as of the earlier of: (i) the date on which the distribution occurs, or (ii) the last day of the Plan Year
in which the Participant incurs five (5) consecutive one (1)-year Breaks in Service. For purposes of this Section, if the
value of a Participant9s vested Account balance is zero (0), then the Participant shall be deemed to have received a
distribution of such vested Account balance.
(b) If a Participant has the option to elect and does not elect to receive the value of their vested Account balance following
their Severance Date in accordance with the
29

requirements of Section 7.9, then the nonvested portion of the Participant9s Account balance shall be treated as a
forfeiture as of the day that the Participant incurs five (5) consecutive one (1)-year Breaks in Service.
(c) If a Participant is not fully vested in their Account, and that Participant receives a distribution in accordance with the

requirements of Section 7.9 and subsequently resumes employment with a Participating Employer, then that
Participant9s partially-vested Account balance shall be restored, unadjusted for earnings or losses, to the amount on the
Valuation Date preceding the date of distribution; provided, however, that the Participant repays to the Plan the full
amount of the distribution attributable to partially-vested Contributions before the earlier of five (5) years after the
Participant9s reemployment commencement date, or the date the Participant incurs five (5) consecutive one (1)-year
Breaks in Service following the date of the distribution. If a Participant is deemed to receive a distribution pursuant to
paragraph (a) above, and the Participant resumes employment covered under the Plan before the date the Participant
incurs five (5) consecutive one (1)-year Breaks in Service, then, upon the Participant9s reemployment commencement
date, the partially-vested Account balance of the Participant shall be restored, unadjusted for earnings or losses, to the
amount on the Valuation Date preceding the date of such deemed distribution. The funds for effecting the restoration of
the Account shall be drawn out of forfeitures or from a special Contribution to the Plan made by the Company, or, if so
determined by the Company, by the Participating Employer that last employed the Participant. The amount contributed
to the Participant9s Account for the purpose of effecting such restoration shall not be considered to be part of the
Annual Additions to the Account of such Participant for the Plan Year of restoration or any subsequent Plan Year.
(d) Any amounts forfeited pursuant to this Section, any amounts attributable to forfeitures transferred pursuant to the

ARTICLE VII

DISTRIBUTION OF ACCOUNTS

7.1 Termination of Employment. Following a Participant9s severance from employment for any reason, the Participant may elect to

have their vested Account balance distributed in accordance with this Article VII.

7.2 Disability. If a Participant incurs a Disability, then that Participant may elect a distribution of their vested Account in accordance
with this Article VII.

7.3 Death Benefits. If a Participant dies before the entire vested balance of their Account has been distributed, then the vested

balance in their Account shall be paid to the Participant9s Beneficiary in accordance with this Article VII.

7.4 Change to a Leased Employee. If a Participant experiences a change in employment status to that of a Leased Employee and the

Participant continues to work for any Employer, such change will not be treated as a severance from employment with the Employer for

purposes of receiving a distribution under the Plan.

7.5 Beneficiary Designation.

(a) If the Participant is married, then the Participant9s Beneficiary shall be their Surviving Spouse. However, the Participant
may designate a Beneficiary other than their Spouse (in accordance with the Committee9s procedures at such time);
provided, however, that: (i) the Participant9s Spouse consents to such designation and to the form thereof (in
accordance with the Committee9s procedures at such time); (ii) such Beneficiary designation may not be changed
without Spousal Consent; and (iii) the Spouse9s consent acknowledges the effect of such Beneficiary designation and is
witnessed by a Plan representative or a notary public (if required by applicable law). Any Spousal Consent or the
establishment that Spousal Consent cannot be obtained shall only apply to the particular Spouse involved.
(b) If, at the time of the Participant9s death, the Participant has no Surviving Spouse or designated Beneficiary, then the
Participant9s Beneficiary shall be the individual representative of the Participant9s estate.
(c) A Participant9s Beneficiary shall be bound by the terms and conditions of the Plan. The designations, consents and the
like required pursuant to this Section shall be executed in accordance with the Committee9s procedures at such time.
(d) Unless the Participant has indicated otherwise on the Beneficiary designation, any designation of a Beneficiary
identified as Participant9s Spouse shall be deemed revoked by the divorce of the Participant and such Beneficiary.
Such revocation shall be effective upon receipt of acceptable documentary evidence of divorce, delivered after
the Participant9s death to the Committee. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this section, any domestic
relations order submitted to and qualified under Section 9.5 at any time prior to the final transfer and/or
payment of the Participant9s Account shall be deemed to constitute such acceptable documentary evidence of
divorce.
(e)A Spouse or Beneficiary who predeceases the Participant shall have no rights or interest in the Participant9s Account
except that the rights of an Alternate Payee under a qualified domestic relations order (as described in Section 9.5) shall
supersede any contravening provision in this Section. If a Participant and the Participant9s Beneficiary
31

should die simultaneously (defined as within one hundred twenty (120) hours of each other), or under circumstances
that render it difficult or impossible to determine who predeceased the other, then unless the Participant9s Beneficiary
designation otherwise specifies, the Committee will presume conclusively that the Beneficiary predeceased the
Participant.
7.6 Form of Distribution. Distributions shall be in the form of cash, or if a Participant so elects, in the form of whole shares of

Company Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares to the extent invested in Company Stock, except for amounts attributable to the
Participant9s Money Purchase Pension Account as described in Appendix B.

7.7 Form of Benefit. Subject to this Article VII and in accordance with the rules established by the Administrator, a Participant9s

vested Account balance shall be paid to the Participant in one of the following two ways: (i) in the form of a single lump sum payment or a
partial lump sum payment of any amount; or (ii) effective for distributions made on and after January 1, 2022, in monthly, quarterly, semi-

annual or annual installments paid to the Participant and calculated as a fixed dollar amount, as a fixed percent, over the Participant9s life

expectancy or as a declining balance payment, except in the case of amounts attributable to a Participant9s Money Purchase Pension Account as

described in Appendix B below. A Participant9s vested Account balance shall be paid to the Participant9s Beneficiary in the form of a single lump

sum payment or partial lump sum payment of any amount and in accordance with Section 7.10 below.

7.8 Commencement of Distribution. Subject to this Article VII, following a Participant9s severance from employment, the
Participant9s vested Account balance shall be distributed in accordance with the Committee9s procedures, and shall be subject to the following:

(a) if the Participant9s vested Account balance does not exceed One Thousand Dollars ($1,000) (including amounts
attributable to Rollover Contributions) at the time of the distribution, and if the Participant does not elect to have such
distribution paid directly to an Eligible Retirement Plan specified by the Participant in a Direct Rollover or to receive the
distribution directly in accordance with this Section and Section 7.10, then the Participant shall receive a lump sum
distribution of the entire vested portion of such Account balance and the nonvested portion shall be treated as a
forfeiture;
(b) if the Participant9s vested Account balance exceeds One Thousand Dollars ($1,000) but does not exceed Five Thousand
Dollars ($5,000) (including amounts attributable to Rollover Contributions) at the time of the distribution, and if the
Participant does not elect to have such distribution paid directly to an Eligible Retirement Plan specified by the
Participant in a Direct Rollover or to receive the distribution directly in accordance with this Article VII, then the
Administrator will pay the distribution in a Direct Rollover to an individual retirement plan designated by the
Administrator; or
(c) if the Participant9s vested Account balance exceeds Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000) at the time of the distribution, then
the Participant must consent, in writing, prior to the distribution.

(b) Required Beginning Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Plan, a Participant may not defer
commencement of their benefits past their Required Beginning Date. A Participant9s Required Beginning Date is
April 1 of the calendar year following the later of (i) the calendar year in which the Participant attains age 72 (or
age 70½ if the Participant obtained age 70½ on or prior to December 31, 2019) or (ii) the calendar year in which the
Participant has a severance from employment with the Employer; provided, however, that the Required
Beginning Date of a Participant who is a 5% owner will be determined without regard to clause (ii).
(c) Distributions for Participants Who Have Reached Their Required Beginning Date. If a Participant has attained their
Required Beginning Date, payment of the Participant9s benefits will be made over the life expectancy of that Participant
or over the life expectancy of that Participant and their designated Beneficiary, determined in accordance with the
applicable table contained in the applicable Income Tax Regulations under Code Section 401(a)(9).
(d)401(a)(9) Deferral Limitations for Beneficiaries.

(i) Death After Required Beginning Date. If a Participant dies on or after the Participant9s Required Beginning

sum payment, with the exception of amounts attributable to a Participant9s Money Purchase Pension Account as
described in Appendix B.
(ii) Death Before Required Beginning Date. Subject to paragraph (iii) below, if the Participant dies before the
Participant9s Required Beginning Date, distribution of the Participant9s entire Account will be made in a single
lump sum by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the Participant9s death, with
the exception of amounts attributable to a Participant9s Money Purchase Pension Account as described in
Appendix B.
(iii) Surviving Spouse. If the sole Beneficiary is the Participant9s Surviving Spouse, the date distributions are required
to begin to the Surviving Spouse will not be earlier than December 31 of the calendar year in which the
Participant would have attained age 72 (or age 70½ if the Participant obtained age 70½ on or prior to
December 31, 2019). If the Surviving Spouse dies before distribution is made, distribution will be made to the
Spouse9s beneficiary in a single lump sum at any time prior to December 31 of the calendar year containing the
fifth anniversary of the Surviving Spouse9s death.
34

(e)Timing. Subject to Income Tax Regulation section 1.411(a)-11(c)(7) and the provisions of this Plan, benefits will become
payable no later than 60 days after the last to occur of (a) the last day of the Plan Year in which the Participant attains
age 65, (b) the last day of the Plan Year in which the Participant separates from employment with the Employer, or (c)
the 10th anniversary of the last day of the Plan Year in which the Participant commenced participation in the Plan, unless
the Participant elects otherwise.

Beneficiaries who would have been required to receive required minimum distributions for calendar year 2009
did not receive those distributions for calendar year 2009 in accordance with Code Section 401(a)(9)(H) unless an
election was made by such Participant or Beneficiary to receive such distributions in accordance with procedures
established by the Committee.
7.11 Distribution to Minor or Incompetent. If any individual to whom a benefit is payable under the Plan is a minor, or if the

Committee determines that any individual to whom a benefit is payable under the Plan is incompetent to receive such payment or to give a valid
release thereof, then the Committee may direct that such distribution be paid to the legal guardian, or, if none, to a parent of such minor or

incompetent, or a responsible adult with whom the minor or incompetent resides, or to a custodian for a minor under the Uniform Transfers to

Minors Act (or other statutes of similar relevance), if permitted by the laws of the state in which the minor or incompetent resides. Payment to

the legal guardian, parent or custodian of a minor Beneficiary shall fully discharge the Trustee, the Employer, the Administrator , the Committee,

and the Plan from liability on account thereof. A minor is a person who has not yet reached the age of majority for the ownership of

investments under the law of the state of the minor9s domicile. A former minor may request that the inherited Account be transferred

to them at any time after attaining the age of majority.

7.12 Location of Participant or Beneficiary Unknown. If a Participant or Beneficiary who is entitled to a distribution cannot be

located and the Committee has made reasonable efforts (in accordance with Department of Labor guidelines) to locate the Participant or

Beneficiary, then the Participant9s or Beneficiary9s interest shall be forfeited and used as set forth in Section 6.2. If the Participant or Beneficiary

makes a claim for the Account (such claim shall be made in accordance with the Committee9s procedures at such time) subsequent to the

forfeiture, then the Employer shall cause the Account to be reinstated without adjustment for earnings or losses.

7.13 Prohibition Against Profiting from Participant9s Death. If the Committee determines that a Beneficiary may have

intentionally caused the Participant9s death, the Committee may take any action the Committee determines appropriate, including but not

limited to:

(a) Delaying payments of any benefit to such Beneficiary for any period the Committee determines appropriate, including
until there is a judicial determination of the Beneficiary9s guilt or innocence;
(b) Deciding to pay the benefit otherwise payable to the Beneficiary to another Beneficiary; and

(c) Applying the rules of the state in which the death occurred to determine the proper Beneficiary.

(a) The Company shall have full power and authority to amend the provisions of the Plan for any reason, at any time, to
such extent and in such manner as the Company shall deem advisable, in accordance with its normally established
procedures. The Company may delegate such power, in whole or in part, to one or more individuals or committees
(comprised of officers or other managerial personnel of the Company).
(b) The Committee has been delegated the full power and authority to execute amendments to (i) clarify any provision of
the Plan, (ii) bring the Plan into compliance with applicable law, (iii) provide for the continued tax-qualified status
of the Plan, or (iv) amend the Plan and other related documents as deemed necessary or appropriate by the
Committee (and any member of the Committee is authorized to execute such amendment or other related
document); provided that no such amendment results in a significant financial impact on the Company.
(c)An amendment shall become effective, in accordance with its terms, as to all Participants and all other persons having or
claiming an interest under the Plan, upon the effective date specified in the instrument evidencing such amendment.
However, no such amendment shall operate to: (i) cause any part of the Trust to revert to or to be recoverable by a
Participating Employer or to be used for, or diverted to, purposes other than the exclusive benefit of Participants and
their Beneficiaries (or for defraying the reasonable administrative expenses of the Plan); (ii) reduce the then outstanding
balances in the Accounts of Participants; or (iii) affect, reduce or eliminate any benefits which are protected benefits
pursuant to Code Section 411(d)(6), except as permitted under Income Tax Regulations Section 1.411(d) 1 4.
10.2 Termination of Plan.

(a) The Company may terminate this Plan at any time for any reason by resolution adopted by the Board, or its authorized
delegate, but the Trust may neither thereby be diverted from the exclusive benefit of the Participants, their
Beneficiaries, survivors or estates (other than for defraying the reasonable administrative expenses of the Plan), nor
revert to a Participating Employer.
(b) Upon termination of the Plan (as determined by the Company or its authorized delegate) or the complete
discontinuance of Employer contributions under the Plan (as determined by the Company), the Accounts of each
Participant shall be nonforfeitable. The Administrator shall distribute each Participant9s Accounts to the Participant

(a)The Committee shall have the full power and authority to effect from time to time, upon such terms and conditions
deemed appropriate, the merger of any and all tax-qualified defined contribution plans (and related tax-exempt trusts)
maintained by
41

entities acquired by the Company into the Plan and Trust, and to take any and all such actions, and prepare, execute,
and deliver all such documents as may be necessary or advisable to effect any and all such plan and related trust
mergers.
(b) Nothing contained herein shall prevent the merger or consolidation of the Plan with, or transfer of assets or liabilities of

the Plan to, another plan meeting the requirements of Code Section 401(a) or the transfer to the Plan of assets or
liabilities of another such plan so qualified under the Code. Any such merger, consolidation or transfer shall be
accompanied by the transfer of such existing records and information as may be necessary or appropriate to properly
allocate such assets among Participants, including, without limitation, any tax or other information necessary for the
Participants or persons administering the plan that is receiving such assets. The terms of such merger, consolidation or

Participant (or, if applicable, their Beneficiary or an Alternate Payee) would receive a benefit immediately after the
merger, consolidation or transfer equal to or greater than the benefit the Participant would have received if the Plan had

ARTICLE XI

TOP-HEAVY PROVISIONS

11.1 Purpose. This Article is intended to ensure that the Plan complies with Code Section 416. Code Section 416 and the applicable

Income Tax Regulations are herein incorporated by reference. If the Plan is or becomes Top-Heavy in any Plan Year, then the provisions of this

Article shall supersede any conflicting provision in the Plan.

11.2 Definitions.

(a)Determination Date. <Determination Date= means the last day of the preceding Plan Year.

(b)Key Employee. <Key Employee= means any Employee or former Employee (including the Beneficiaries of such Employee
and any deceased Employee) who at any time during the Plan Year that includes the Determination Date, was (i) an
officer of the Employer having annual Compensation greater than the amount in effect under Code Section 416(i)(1)(A),
as adjusted by the Secretary of the Treasury under Code Section 415(d) ; (ii) a five percent (5%) owner of the Employer;
or (iii) a one percent (1%) owner of the Employer who has annual compensation of more than One Hundred Fifty
Thousand Dollars ($150,000). For purposes of this Section, compensation has the meaning given by Code Section 416(i)
(1)(D) and shall be based only on compensation that is actually paid. A determination of who constitutes a Key Employee
shall be made in accordance with Code Section 416(i)(1) and the applicable Income Tax Regulations and other guidance
of general applicability issued thereunder.
(c)Non-Key Employee. <Non-Key Employee= means any Employee who is not a Key Employee.

(d)Permissive Aggregation Group. <Permissive Aggregation Group= means the Required Aggregation Group of plans plus
any other plan(s) of the Employer that, when considered as a group with the Required Aggregation Group, would
continue to satisfy the requirements of Code Sections 401(a)(4) and 410.
(e)Required Aggregation Group. <Required Aggregation Group= means:

(i) each tax-qualified plan of the Employer in which at least one (1) Key Employee participates or participated during
the Plan Year ending on the Determination Date (regardless of whether the plan has terminated); and
(ii) any other tax-qualified plan of the Employer that enables a plan described in paragraph (i) above to meet the
requirements of Code Section 401(a)(4) or 410.
(f) Top-Heavy Plan. <Top-Heavy Plan= means this Plan, if, for any Plan Year, any of the following conditions exists:

(i) the Top-Heavy Ratio for this Plan exceeds sixty percent (60%) and this Plan is not part of any Required
Aggregation Group or Permissive Aggregation Group of plans;
(ii) this Plan is part of a Required Aggregation Group of plans but not part of a Permissive Aggregation Group and
the Top-Heavy Ratio for the Required Aggregation Group exceeds sixty percent (60%); or
43

(iii) this Plan is part of a Required Aggregation Group and part of a Permissive Aggregation Group of plans and the
Top-Heavy Ratio for both the Permissive Aggregation Group and the Required Aggregation Group exceeds sixty
percent (60%).
(g)Top-Heavy Ratio. <Top-Heavy Ratio= means:

(i) if the Employer maintains one or more defined contribution plans (including any simplified employee pension
plan) and the Employer has not maintained any defined benefit plan that during the one (1)-year period ending
on the Determination Date(s) has or has had accrued benefits, then the Top-Heavy Ratio for this Plan alone or for
the Required or Permissive Aggregation Group, as appropriate, is a fraction, the numerator of which is the sum
of the Account balances of all Key Employees as of the Determination Date(s) (including any part of any Account
balance distributed in the one (1)-year period ending on the Determination Date(s)), and the denominator of
which is the sum of Account balances (including any part of any Account balance distributed in the one (1)-year
period ending on the Determination Date(s)), both computed in accordance with Code Section 416. Both the
numerator and denominator of the Top-Heavy Ratio are increased to reflect any contribution not actually made
as of the Determination Date, but which is required to be taken into account on that date under Code Section
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of a distribution of a portion of a Participant9s Account balance
that is made for a reason other than severance from employment, death or Disability, the provisions of this
paragraph shall be applied by substituting <five (5)-year period= for <one (1)-year period.=
(ii) if the Employer maintains one or more defined contribution plans (including any simplified employee pension
plan) and the Employer maintains or has maintained one or more defined benefit plans that during the one (1)-
year period ending on the Determination Date(s) has or has had any accrued benefits, then the Top-Heavy Ratio
for any Required or Permissive Aggregation Group as appropriate, is a fraction, the numerator of which is the
sum of Account balances under the aggregated defined contribution plan or plans for all Key Employees,
determined in accordance with paragraph (i) above, and the present value of accrued benefits under the
aggregated defined benefit plan or plans for all Key Employees as of the Determination Date(s), and the
denominator of which is the sum of Account balances under the aggregated defined contribution plan or plans
for all participants, determined in accordance with paragraph (i) above, and the present value of accrued
benefits under the defined benefit plan or plans for all participants as of the Determination Date(s), all
determined in accordance with Code Section 416. The accrued benefits under a defined benefit plan in both the
numerator and denominator of the Top-Heavy Ratio are increased for any distribution of an accrued benefit
made in the one (1)-year period ending on the Determination Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case
of a distribution of a portion of a Participant9s Account balance that is made for a reason other than severance
from employment, death or Disability, the provisions of this paragraph shall be applied by substituting <five (5)-
year period= for <one (1)-year period.=
(iii) for purposes of paragraphs (i) and (ii) above, the value of Account balances and the present value of accrued
benefits shall be determined as of the last
44

day of the most recent Plan Year that falls within or ends with the twelve (12) month period ending on the
Determination Date, except as provided in Code Section 416 for the first and second plan years of a defined
benefit plan. The Account balances and accrued benefits of a participant (1) who is not a Key Employee but who
was a Key Employee in a prior year, or (2) who has not been credited with at least one (1) hour of service with
any Employer maintaining the Plan at any time during the one (1)-year period ending on the Determination Date
shall be disregarded. The calculation of the Top-Heavy Ratio, and the extent to which distributions, rollovers, and
transfers are taken into account shall be made in accordance with Code Section 416. When aggregating plans,
the value of Account balances and accrued benefits shall be calculated with reference to the Determination
Dates that fall within the same calendar year.
The accrued benefit of a Participant other than a Key Employee shall be determined under (1) the method, if any, that uniformly applies for

accrual purposes under all defined benefit plans maintained by the Employer, or (2) if there is no such method, as if such benefit accrued not

more rapidly than the slowest accrual rate permitted under the fractional rule of Code Section 411(b)(1)(C).

11.3 Minimum Allocation.

(a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) below, in any Plan Year that the Plan is Top-Heavy, Employer
contributions (other than Employee Contributions and Catch-Up Contributions) allocated to the Accounts of each
Participant who is a Non-Key Employee, shall be not less than the lesser of (i) three percent (3%) of the Non-Key
Employee9s Compensation, or (ii) in the case where the Employer has no defined benefit plan which designates this Plan
to satisfy Code Section 401(a), the largest percentage of Contributions (other than Catch-Up Contributions) and
forfeitures (if applicable), as a percentage of Compensation allocated on behalf of any Key Employee for that Plan Year.
(b) The provisions in paragraph (a) above shall not apply to any Participant who was not employed by the Employer on the
last day of the Plan Year.
(c) The provisions in paragraph (a) above shall not apply to any Participant to the extent the Participant is covered under
any other qualified plan or plans of the Employer that provide the minimum allocation described above.
(d) The minimum allocation required (to the extent required to be nonforfeitable under Code Section 416(b)) cannot be
forfeited under Code Section 411(a)(3)(B) or (D).

while performing qualified military service (as defined in Code Section 414(u)), the Beneficiary of that Participant is entitled, to the extent

required by Code Section 401(a)(37), to any additional benefits provided under the Plan as if the Participant had resumed employment on the

date immediately before their date of death and then terminated employment on account of death.

individual(s), and the results of such action are adverse to that individual(s), attorney9s fees and all other direct and indirect expenses and costs

incurred by the Employer, each Participating Employer, the Company (including, without limitation, the Board and the Compensation

by law, be charged against the interest, if any, of such individual(s) under the Plan.

12.3 No Enlargement of Plan Rights. Each individual agrees, as a condition of participation in the Plan, that they shall look solely to

the assets of the Trust for the payment of any benefit under the Plan.

12.4 No Enlargement of Employment Rights. Nothing appearing in or done pursuant to the Plan shall be construed to give any
individual a legal or equitable right or interest in the assets of the Trust or distribution therefrom (except as expressly provided in the Plan), nor

against any Participating Employer (except as expressly provided in the Plan), or to create or modify any contract of employment between a

Participating Employer and any Employee or to obligate a Participating Employer to continue the services of any Employee.

12.5 Interpretation. The headings contained in this Plan or in any Appendix hereto, are for reference purposes only, and shall not

affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of the Plan. Any capitalized term used in any Appendix hereto, but not otherwise defined

applications, and communications) to be filed under the Plan shall be filed with the person or entity designated by the Company or the

Committee, as applicable. Each such action shall be effective only upon actual receipt by the designated person or entity.

other pertinent Federal laws and, to the extent not preempted by ERISA, in accordance with the laws of the State of California (irrespective of

the choice of law principles of the State of California as to all matters); provided, however, that if any provision is susceptible to more than one
interpretation, such interpretation shall be given thereto as is consistent with the Plan being a tax-qualified plan and related tax-exempt trust

under Code Sections 401(a) and 501(a), respectively.

46

12.8 Non-Alienation of Benefits. None of the benefits, payments, proceeds or claims of any Participant under the Plan shall be

expenses of the Plan, shall be used for any purpose other than exclusive benefit of Participants or their Beneficiaries. However, upon the

Committee9s request, the Trustee shall return the appropriate amount to a Participating Employer under any of the following circumstances,

unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then the remainder of the Plan, or the application of such term or provision to individuals or

circumstances other than those as to whom it is held invalid or unenforceable, shall not be affected thereby, and each provision of the Plan shall

established by the Committee prior to the date such Election becomes irrevocable with respect to a dividend (as
determined by the Committee). A Participant9s Election shall remain in force until such Election is changed by the
Participant consistent with procedures established by the Committee.
(b) Default Election. If, as of the date a Participant9s Election applicable to a dividend paid as of a specific Pay Date
would otherwise become irrevocable, the Participant does not have a valid election in place, as determined
under the Committee9s procedures, such Participant shall be deemed to have elected to have any such dividend
reinvested in the ESOP.

a Participant consistent with the Participant9s Election later than 90 days after the close of the Plan Year in which
the dividend is paid.
(d) Annual Additions. Dividends on Company Stock that are paid in a cash distribution to a Participant or reinvested
in the ESOP, consistent with a

Participant9s Election, are not treated as Annual Additions for purposes of Article V.

A.3. Diversification.

A Participant may direct that all or any part of their interest in the ESOP be liquidated and reinvested in any of the

investment options available under the non-ESOP part of the Plan. Transfers from the ESOP to other investment options are subject to

the standard investment procedures established by the Committee for the non-ESOP part of the Plan.

A.4. Voting.

the benefit of persons specified in Code Section 409(n) during the non-allocation period defined in Code Section 409(n)(3)(C).

APPENDIX B
GUIDELINES FOR ANNUITY FORMS OF DISTRIBUTION
The provisions of this Appendix B are intended to set forth the guidelines for providing annuities as a form of distribution for

amounts attributable solely to a Participant9s Money Purchase Pension Account under the Plan. Annuities shall only be offered as a form of
distribution to Participants (or Surviving Spouses or Beneficiaries thereof, as applicable) with a Money Purchase Pension Account under the Plan

to the extent required to comply with Code Section 411(d)(6).

B.1. Definitions.

(a)<Annuity Starting Date= means the first day of the first period for which an amount is payable as an annuity or, in the
case of a benefit not payable in the form of an annuity, the first day on which all the events have occurred that entitle
the Participant (or their Surviving Spouse or Beneficiary, as applicable) to such benefit.
(b) <Joint and Survivor Annuity= means an annuity under which joint and survivor benefits are paid to the Participant for
their life and, following the Participant9s death, are paid to the Participant9s Surviving Spouse during the Surviving
Spouse9s lifetime at a rate equal to fifty percent (50%) or seventy-five percent (75%) of the rate at which the benefits are
payable to the Participant, provided that with respect to a Participant who is not married on the Annuity Starting Date,
the Joint and Survivor Annuity is a single life annuity payable to the Participant. The Joint and Survivor Annuity is
purchased with the distributable proceeds of a Participant9s Money Purchase Pension Account balance.
(c) <Pre-Retirement Survivor Annuity= means an annuity for the life of the Participant9s Surviving Spouse purchased with
the distributable portion of the Participant9s Money Purchase Pension Account balance.
Capitalized terms used in this Appendix B that are not defined herein shall have the meaning as those terms have in the Plan.

B.2. Special Rules Regarding Money Purchase Pension Accounts.

(a)Pre-Retirement Survivor Annuity. Unless otherwise elected as provided below, a Participant who dies before their
Annuity Starting Date and who has a Surviving Spouse will have their Money Purchase Pension Account balance paid to
their Surviving Spouse in the form of a Pre-Retirement Survivor Annuity. Unless the Surviving Spouse consents to an
earlier distribution, payment of the Pre-Retirement Survivor Annuity will begin within a reasonable time after the later of
(i) the date the Participant would have attained their Normal Retirement age or (ii) the date that is 90 days after the
death of the Participant.
(b)Waiver of Pre-Retirement Survivor Annuity.

(i) An election to waive the Pre-Retirement Survivor Annuity before the Participant9s death must be made by the
Participant during the election period in writing and on a form prescribed therefore by the Committee, and will
require the irrevocable Spousal Consent. A Participant may revoke such election at any time and any number of
times during the period between the first day of the Plan Year in which the Participant attains age thirty-five (35)
and the date of the Participant9s death.
50

(ii) Notwithstanding the terms of any waiver regarding the form of death benefit, if the Surviving Spouse has not, at
the time of the Participant9s death, properly consented to a non-Spouse Beneficiary, the Surviving Spouse may
elect on a form provided by the Committee (A) to begin receiving the Pre-Retirement Survivor Annuity within a
reasonable time following the later of the Participant9s death or the Surviving Spouse9s election, or (B) to receive
a single sum distribution of the Participant9s Money Purchase Pension Account balance within a reasonable time
following the later of the Participant9s death or the Surviving Spouse9s election. Any written election described in
this Section must be obtained not more than ninety (90) days before distribution begins and will be made in
accordance with the provisions of this Section.
(c)Election Period. The election period to waive the Pre-Retirement Survivor Annuity will begin on the first day of the Plan

Year in which the Participant attains age 35 and will end on the date of the Participant9s death. An earlier waiver (with
Spousal Consent) may be made, but the waiver will become invalid at the beginning of the Plan Year in which the
Participant attains age 35. When a Participant separates from service prior to the beginning of the election period, the
election period will begin on the date of separation from service.
(d)Notice of Election Rights. The Committee will provide Participants with an explanation of the election that meets the

requirements of Code Section 417(a)(3)(B).

(e)Joint and Survivor Annuity. Unless otherwise elected as provided below, a Participant who does not die before their

Annuity Starting Date will receive their Money Purchase Pension Account balance in the form of a Joint and Survivor
Annuity. The Joint and Survivor Annuity will begin within a reasonable time after the Participant9s Annuity Starting Date.
(f) Election to Waive Joint and Survivor Annuity. An election to waive the Joint and Survivor Annuity must be made by

the Participant during the election period in writing on a form provided by the Committee with Spousal Consent. An
election to designate a Beneficiary or form of benefits may not be changed without Spousal Consent. An unmarried
Participant may elect in writing during the election period on a form provided by the Committee to waive the Joint and
Survivor Annuity. An election may be revoked by the Participant in writing without the consent of the Spouse at any time
during the election period. The number of revocations will not be limited. Any new election must comply with the
requirements of this paragraph.
(g)Election Period. The election period to waive the Joint and Survivor Annuity is the ninety (90) day period ending on the

Annuity Starting Date. A payment will not be considered to occur after the Annuity Starting Date when actual payment is
reasonably delayed for calculation of the benefit amount.
(h)Notice of Election Rights. The Committee will provide the Participant with an explanation of the election which meets

the requirements of Code Section 417(a)(3)(A) (taking into account Code Section 417(a)(7)).

(i) Effect of Waiver. If a proper waiver is executed with respect to a Participant, the Participant9s Money Purchase Pension
Account balance can be distributed in the same form, at the same time, and subject to the same Beneficiary designation
as all other amounts in the Plan with respect to the Participant.

51

(j) Purchase of Annuities. Any costs associated with the purchase of annuity contracts under this Article will be charged

against the distributable proceeds of the Participant9s Money Purchase Pension Account balance. After an annuity
contract has been purchased, neither the Plan, the Committee, nor the Company will have any further obligation for
payment of benefits attributable to the Participant9s Money Purchase Pension Account balance.
(k) Small Amounts. If the value of a Participant9s entire benefit does not exceed Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000), including
Rollover Contributions, (determined as of such times and in the manner as is required by Code Section 417), this
Appendix B will not apply to the Participant.

(l) Required Minimum Distributions. Distributions of amounts attributable to a Participant9s Money Purchase Pension

Account will be made in accordance with Code Section 401(a)(9), including the incidental benefit requirement of
Code Section 401(a)(9)(G) and Income Tax Regulations sections 1.401(a)(9)-2 through 9.

ruling), for the benefit of the Israeli Eligible Employees, in accordance with the provisions of Section 102 and the Tax
Ruling.

4.5 Upon receipt of any Trustee 102 Stock Purchase Right, the Israeli Eligible Employee will consent to the grant of the Trustee
102 Stock Purchase Right and to the Election under Section 102 and undertake to comply with the terms of Section 102,

4.6 Should the Trustee 102 Stock Purchase Rights or any Common Stock issued in connection with such Trustee 102 Stock
Purchase Rights be transferred by power
of a last will or under laws of decent, the provisions of Section 102 shall apply to the heirs or transferees of the deceased
Israeli Eligible Employee.
4.7 It is clarified that if Common Stock is purchased when the Eligible Employee is no longer an Israeli Eligible Employee, the
provisions of this Sub-Plan shall not apply to the Common Stock purchased on behalf of such Eligible Employee and the
Common Stock shall not be subject to Section 102 or the Tax Ruling.
5. ASSIGNABILITY, DESIGNATION AND SALE

5.1 Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, no Trustee 102 Stock Purchase Right or any right with respect
thereto, or purchasable hereunder, whether fully paid or not, shall be assignable, transferable or given as collateral, or given to
any third party whatsoever, and during the lifetime of the Israeli Eligible Employee, each and all of such Israeli Eligible
Employee9s rights with respect to a Trustee 102 Stock Purchase Right shall belong only to the Israeli Eligible Employee. Any such
action made directly or indirectly, for an immediate or future validation, shall be void.
5.2 As long as Trustee 102 Stock Purchase Rights or Common Stock purchased hereunder are held by the Trustee on behalf of
the Israeli Eligible Employee, all rights of the Israeli Eligible Employee over the Common Stock cannot be transferred,
assigned, pledged or mortgaged, other than by will or laws of descent and distribution.

Employee and held by the Trustee, in the event a dividend is declared, any such dividends paid on such Common Stock shall be
deposited with the Trustee and will subject to any applicable taxation on distribution of dividends, and when applicable, subject
to the provisions of Section 102 and the Tax Ruling.
8. TAX CONSEQUENCES

8.1 The Tax Ruling shall govern the taxation of Common Stock purchased by Israeli Eligible Employees under the Plan and this
Sub-Plan.
8.2 Any Tax consequences arising from the grant of any option to purchase Common Stock, from the purchase of Common
Stock, from the sale of Common Stock
purchased or received otherwise or from any other event or act (of the Company and/or the Employing Company and/or
the Trustee and/or the Israeli Eligible Employee) shall be borne solely by the Israeli Eligible Employee. The Company
and/or the Employing Company and/or the Trustee shall withhold Tax according to the requirements under the
applicable laws, rules and regulations, including withholding taxes at source. Furthermore, the Israeli Eligible Employee
agrees to indemnify the Company and/or the Employing Company and/or the Trustee and hold them harmless against
and from any and all liability for any such Tax or interest or penalty thereon, including, without limitation, liabilities
relating to the necessity to withhold, or to have withheld, any such Tax from any payment made to the Israeli Eligible
Employee.
8.3 The Trustee shall not be required to release any Common Stock to an Israeli Eligible Employee until all required Tax
payments have been fully made.

become subject to a different tax route in the future.

Israeli Eligible Employees and are not and shall not be deemed a salary component for any purpose whatsoever, including,
without limitation, in connection with calculating severance compensation under any applicable law.

comply with applicable Israeli law.
11. GOVERNING LAW

without giving effect to the principles of conflict of laws.
