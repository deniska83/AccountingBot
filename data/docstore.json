To estimate the environmental and social \nimpacts of Citi-financed projects and activities we looked at the following metrics:\n •Avoided GHG emissions refers to the amount of GHG emissions avoided because of Citi’s share of financing for renewable \nenergy, green affordable housing and energy efficiency projects. GHG emissions avoidance is calculated by applying regional \nelectric grid factors to Citi’s share of financing across three types of activities, including a low-carbon source replacing energy \nuse from the grid, energy efficiency upgrades and green housing units that are LEED-certified.

In situations where this \nreview uncovered high risks that were not adequately addressed through company policies and practices, or when credible accusations of forced \nlabor existed, we engaged those clients on improvements needed.
