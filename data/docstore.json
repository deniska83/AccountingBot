Use of the standards can benefit businesses by improving transparency, risk \nmanagement, and performance. SASB standards can help investors by encouraging reporting that is comparable, \nconsistent, and financially material, thereby enabling investors to make better investment and voting decisions.\nOverview of SASB Standards \nThe SASB has developed a set of 77 industry-specific sustainability accounting standards (“SASB standards” or “industry \nstandards”), categorized pursuant to SASB’s Sustainable Industry Classification System\n®","metadata":{"source":"/Users/sage/Desktop/AccountingBot/documents/Commercial_Banks_Standard_2018.pdf"}}],["27",{"pageContent":"standards”), categorized pursuant to SASB’s Sustainable Industry Classification System\n®\n (SICS\n®\n).

SASB standards include:\n1. Disclosure topics – A minimum set of industry-specific disclosure topics reasonably likely to constitute material \ninformation, and a brief description of how management or mismanagement of each topic may affect value creation.\n2. Accounting metrics – A set of quantitative and/or qualitative accounting metrics intended to measure performance \non each topic.\n3.
